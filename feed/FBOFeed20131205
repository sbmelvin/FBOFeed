<a href="mailto:james.s.casper@nasa.gov">James S. Casper</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to extend the current Manufacturing Support and Facility Operations Contract (MSFOC), number NNM09AA20C, for the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) for one year.    MSFOC provides mission-focused integrated production and facility operation support to NASA Projects and other on-site users and tenants.  This wide range of support services includes: program management, safety, health and emergency management, integrated manufacturing support, maintenance, site services, site operations, logistics operations services, sustaining engineering, environmental services, construction, and Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) services.  As both a manufacturing facility for human space flight hardware and an operational installation for users and tenants, MAF's manufacturing support and facility operations are required 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   Award of this requirement to a source other than NNM09AA20C's incumbent contractor, Jacobs Technology, Inc., (hereinafter "Jacobs"), will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA requirements.  This one-year contract extension will allow for the continuation and stability of MSFOC's services at MAF, pending the placement of a competitive follow-on acquisition.    A follow-on contracting activity, entitled "Synergy Achieving Consolidated Operations and Maintenance (SACOM)" is currently in the early stages of acquisition planning.	SACOM's intent is to take advantage of consolidation opportunities between service requirements presently being supported under MSFOC, Stennis Space Center (SSC)'s Facility Operating Services Contract (FOSC), and SSC's Test Operations Contract (TOC).  The consolidation of these contracts will serve as the follow-on re-competition for all three contracts, with SACOM currently projected to be awarded in mid Fiscal Year 2015.  As such, a sizable gap currently exists without contract coverage for MAF's mission services and IDIQ activities given the current MSFOC expiration date.  Any lapse in the MSFOC service provision during the period of the SACOM competition activity and subsequent performance commencement by the selected contractor would cause irreparable harm to the SLS Program.  The one-year MSFOC extension described herein reconciles this gap in contract coverage necessary to maintain MAF's basic site services (i.e., mission services), as well as provides for continuation of IDIQ services for on-site users and tenants.    The recommendation to extend NNM09AA20C for one year is made pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 USC 2304(c) (1) for the acquisition of supplies and services from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:    1.  In light of the above, which establishes the need for stop-gap coverage during the bridge period of the follow-on SACOM competition, a sole-source one-year contract extension is necessary to provide uninterrupted, mission-critical support to MSFC programs and projects at MAF.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii), MSFOC services are deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements.	NASA is currently developing the Space Launch System (SLS) with Core Stage and Orion Crew Capsule manufacturing conducted at MAF.  The importance of this manufacturing effort to the overall success of SLS places MAF on the critical path for maintaining the Programs congressionally-mandated first launch in 2017.	  2.  As noted earlier, Jacobs is responsible for maintaining and operating the facility and equipment used by the prime contractors responsible for SLS and Orion hardware manufacturing.	Jacobs has responsibility for approximately thirty (30) ongoing SLS-related CoF tasks (e.g., Task Order (TO) #374, "Modifications for SLS Component Final Assembly Building 103"; TO #281, "SLS Modifications to MAF Building 131 (Cell N) for Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), Area 63"; TO #282, "SLS Modifications to MAF Building 131 (Cell P) for External Clean and Prime, Area 62"; TO #285, "SLS Modifications to MAF Building 451 for LH2 Proof Testing, Area 30";  and TO #369, "SLS Modifications for Vehicle and Component Transport / Access").  These SLS-related CoF projects are part of the critical path for maintaining the programs congressionally-mandated first launch in 2017.    In addition, Jacobs is also responsible for fourteen (14) ongoing general CoF tasks that include TO #303 for "MAF Building 103 - Repair Roof damaged by Hurricane Isaac", TO #370 for "Replace Forced Main Sanitary Piping in MAF Building 103", and TO #373 to "Replace MAF's Transformer West Master Substation".  These noted CoF task orders are critical milestone projects that require significant management, design, engineering, and coordination between the facility contractor and NASA projects.  Any break in this effort would have a severely negative impact on NASAs ability to meet overall program completion dates.    3.  It is not practical to compete this work and then transition to SACOM for such a short period of time.  The potential benefits of competition would not offset the administrative burden and expense of conducting two competitions simultaneously or the potential disruption of services resulting from multiple and possibly parallel contracts transiting for the same work in less than a one-year period.    Furthermore, Jacobs has proven itself to be capable of managing and executing both the O&M aspect of MAF and CoF activities over the period of MSFOC to date.	In performing MSFOC, Jacobs has developed a unique base of technical knowledge and experience, including the required historical knowledge of the critical NASA programs and projects at MAF.  It is estimated the time and cost to quickly bring another facilities operations and maintenance (O&M) contractor up to par with Jacobs for this one-year period would be in excess of a standard 45 to 60-day phase-in period, likely requiring upwards of 90 days to complete.  The original 60-day MSFOC transition from the predecessor MAF Operations and Maintenance (MOM) portion of the Space Shuttle's External Tank (ET) contract was sufficient as a result of the previous contractor maintaining control of all critical processes for the manufacturing of remaining ETs.  For this transition, it is estimated 90 days would be required based on the incoming contractor having to immediately take up O&M for all SLS-related critical processes, as well as complete critical CoF milestone projects.  As such, NASA would likely not be able to offset the majority of the new contractor's acclimation cost due to the relatively brief timeframe of this extension.	  Additionally, there is no reasonable alternative to modifying the current contract, such that MSFOC would be novated to another O&M contractor (outside of competition) for immediate coverage of MAF's O&M requirements for this temporary period of time.  In addition to the aforementioned	extended acclimation time and likely unrecoverable additional phase-in cost, it would be neither feasible nor reasonable to make award to any contractor other than the incumbent, particularly given the SACOM contract will result in an anticipated competitive award within the twelve (12) month extension period requested herein, as well that NASA does not have supporting rationale to make a sole-source novation of MSFOC to any other competent facilities O&M contractor.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 19, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.    Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.    NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<p>The National Institute of Health, Clinical Center (CC) intends to award a Firm-Fixed price purchase order to Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Large Business) Mountain View, CA 94043-1837 on a sole source basis to procure cytokine reagents in the preparation for treatment of patients with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) enrolled in the FDA approved clinical protocols at the Department of Transfusion Medicine.</p>
<p>According to protocol 12C0112, the investigational new drug only allows for the cytokines from Clontech Laboratories, Inc as it prohibits the substitution of any reagent/process named in the original protocol submission. These cytokines are used to treat a patient with SCID. In order to improve the transduction of the CD34+ cells with the vector which corrects the gene deficiency, the CD34+ cells are stimulated with cytokines and growth factors including RetroNectin, IL3, Thrombopoietin (TPO), stem cells factor (SCF) and Flt-3 ligand. Without these cytokines, it is not possible to correct the patient's CD34+ cells and the patient cannot be treated as outlined in the protocol.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this posting. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement BAA-NHLBI-CSB-HV-2013-02-JS on or about May 29, 2012 to acquire the services of a program coordinating center (PCC) for the Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program. The overall objective of the VITA Program is to enable and accelerate the development of promising diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for certain diseases within the purview of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). In that context, the NHLBI has identified two "opportunity gaps" in the early stages of the development process by which new medical research is translated into new medical products. The first gap occurs between the conceptualization of potential medical advances and the experimental validation of those concepts as medical product candidates (designated as the "Concept to Proof-of-Principle" stage or Stage-A). The second gap resides between the demonstration of proof of principle and the completion of studies required for the assessment of a product candidate in human clinical trials (designated as the "Proof-of-Principle to IND/IDE" stage or Stage-B).
<p>The term "product candidate", as it concerns the VITA Program, is also used to refer to new diagnostics, new therapeutic interventions (agents or devices), or novel applications of existing therapeutic interventions. The product candidate(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, devices, diagnostic tests, imaging probes, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents. The VITA Program will provide support for early-stage translational development of product candidates in the fields of vascular disorders, thrombotic diseases, and pulmonary hypertension.  Proposed project areas of interest may include peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>This solicitation will seek proposals for two (2) different study stages e.g. concept to proof of principle (POP) [Stage-A] and proof of principle to investigational new drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) [Stage-B]. Up to six (6) contracts (with up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-A awards and up to three (3) contracts (with up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-B awards. A total of $5.8M is available for this BAA round. A BAA is not eligible for any small business set-aside program.</p>
<p>Companion to this BAA solicitation, is a request for proposals (RFP) solicitation for a Program Coordinating Center (PCC) to award a single contract to provide project management, meeting coordination, and regulatory advice for the awarded BAA contractors that require such services. The RFP solicitation for the VITA PCC is synopsized in a separate pre-solicitation notice (RFP-NHLBI-CSB-HV-2013-04-JS). Interested Offerors are highly encouraged to locate and review it elsewhere in the FEDBIZOPPS and to review the resulting solicitation. Contract proposals for the BAA and the RFP solicitations will be due in late August 2012. Awards are planned for August 2013.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The solicited requirement will cover 36 months and Cost-Reimbursement-Completion type contracts with options pricing are being considered. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the project's goals and the available funding. The BAA solicitation will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://fedbizopps.gov. Potential Offerors are responsible for downloading the BAA and any/all attachments. It is also Offerors' responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS for any amendments to the BAA. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dr. Margaret Grisius, 7645 Burford Drive, McLean, VA 22102-2516 to provide Professional Support Services for the NIDCR Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), Sjogren's Syndrome Clinic in accordance with the following information:</p>
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide technical support services to the NIDCR Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), Sjogren's Syndrome Clinic. The MPTB conducts research to immune medicated salivary gland inflammatory disorders, especially Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), which affects at least one million Americans. The SS Clinic evaluates 200 - 300 SS patients per year. These patients require saliva collection and salivary gland biopsies to confirm the diagnosis or follow-up on problems. SS patients often experience oral complications that require the evaluation of a dentist with substantial experience in the oral medicine as it pertains to dry mouth, in general, and SS, in particular.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide expertise to continue this project through technical services in accordance with the tasks to be performed.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The contractor shall facilitate the delivery of treatment and consultative services in the SS Clinic, interacting closely with patients diagnosed with SS.</p>
<p>Services to be Performed</p>
<p>- The contractor shall consult one to one and a half days per week, according to the schedule and patient load;<br />- The contractor shall conduct oral medicine evaluation, including screening examinations, saliva collection, labia minor salivary gland biopsies, and other examinations and procedures required by current and future SS Clinic protocols; and,<br />- The contractor shall notify the Chief of the SS Clinic and the Research Nurse Coordinator, or alternate at least two weeks in advance, if unable to consult on schedule days, preferably by e-mail, but if that is not possible, by telephone.</p>
<p>Contractor Evaluation</p>
<p>The work will be observed and reports will be evaluated at the discretion of the Chief of the Sjogren's Syndrome Clinic, or other NIDCR or Clinical Center professional staff as needed.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a computerized record of the evaluations and procedures required by the Medical Records Department, Clinical Center, NIH. In addition, the contractor shall report all findings to the Chief of the SS Clinic to assure the best patient care and to report any problems.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of contract award.</p>
<p>Place of Performance</p>
<p>The place of performance will be onsite at the NIDCR Sjogren's Syndrome Clinic on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Dr. Grisius is a researcher who has been at the NIH since 2009 and has had extensive experience with the MPTB. She has already been performing this work under NIH Protocol Number &lsquo;DE000704-08 MPTB' and it would be detrimental to the Government to have another party come in to take over where she has left off. The time it would take to train a new contractor on this work would result in a great loss of data. Based on this fact, Dr. Grisius is the sole source who can continue these services.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, with a business size standard of $14.0M. This solicitation is set aside for small businesses. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-71(November 25, 2013).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by December 12, 2013 at 7 :00am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number HHSN-NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2014-0024-RSF, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6145, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee.. Responses may be submitted electronically to ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a modification to Contract No. HHSN275201200007C entitled Folic Acid Supplementation and Semen Quality Trial - Trial Clinical Centers, on a sole source basis to the University of Utah, under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).</p>
<p>Specifically, female partners of participants in the Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial (FAZST) will be invited to participate in the Impact of Diet, Exercise And Lifestyle on Fecundity (IDEAL) study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FAZST trial is an ongoing study in the Epidemiology Branch to evaluate the effects of folic acid and zinc supplementation in males on semen quality parameters and pregnancy outcomes among 2400 couples seeking fertility treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Currently, female partners are only minimally involved in FAZST, with a single baseline visit and short monthly web-based questionnaires to track pregnancy outcomes, along with medical chart abstraction to assess fertility treatments and verify reported pregnancy outcomes. Female partners of FAZST couples create a potential cohort of women from whom to study the effects of dietary and lifestyle factors on pregnancy outcomes among couples seeking fertility treatment. The current initiative would be a modification to Contract No. HHSN275201200007C to add additional detailed follow-up (both questionnaires and biospecimen collection) to the female partners of the FAZST trial. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the impacts of modifiable lifestyle factors on fertility in the context of a couple-based approach across a spectrum of fertility and treatment. Female partners of FAZST participants provide a unique and valuable resource, bringing about an opportunity to follow a large, prospective cohort of women undergoing fertility treatment, while leveraging precious resources to create a rich data source for future studies.</p>
<p>This modification will provide for a study to investigate the impact of dietary and other modifiable lifestyle factors in both male and female partners on prospectively measured pregnancy outcomes among couples seeking fertility treatment. The NICHD anticipates that the services above can only be done as a part of the existing infrastructure of the FAZST trial. Awarding a new contract to another contractor would require them to duplicate the infrastructure for participant recruitment, database development, study publicity, staff training, and recruitment of male partners. As the FAZST trial is already in place, extensive resources have been used to prepare the research site for recruitment, including dedicated office space for study activities and training for all staff on current data systems and study procedures. In addition, a large web-based database for data collection, including online questionnaires and biospecimens tracking, storage, and shipping procedures have already been developed and are currently in place. All of this work would need to be duplicated in order to complete the new requirements. Importantly, adding follow-up for the female partners creates a rich and unique data source for studying lifestyle factors of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">both</em> the male and female partners. If the proposed work were to be done by another contractor, it would involve duplicated effort to recruit and obtain information on their male partners to create the same database of information for future study. The couple-based approach for studying dietary and other modifiable lifestyle factors on reproduction is critical for moving the field forward and informing preconception guidance. This would result in unacceptable delays, substantial duplication of effort, and increased costs to the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if any responsible source believes it can perform the above requirement, they may submit three (3) copies of their capability statement<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>for consideration by the NICHD to Megan Gnall, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland, 20852).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phone number 301-435-6924 and fax number 301-402-3676.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All responses must be received in writing no later than December 20, 2013 and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD to determine if the party can perform this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The capability statement will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01012014
<CONTACT>SEAN MCGINLEY 215-697-5025 LEANNE HANGER, 215-697-9690
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, intends to solicit on a sole source basis a requirement for digitizing conversion of the Navy Members Service Treatment Records (STRs), both Medical and Dental, and the delivery of the scanned STRs to the VA through the Healthcare Artifact and Information Management Solution (HAIMS) in support to the Navys Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), Falls Church, VA.  The required start date is 1 JAN 2014.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 - a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).
   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Anacomp, Inc., a small business.  The provision of the required services requires access to PII/PHI.   All contractor employees under the resultant order who require access to Personal Health Information and Privacy Act protected information are categorized no lower than IT-II.  At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position.  The contractors facility, infrastructure and processes must be certified compliant with federal standards for secure handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) and the contractor must possess current Authority to Operate (ATO) under A&A.
  
These standards are:
	National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53 Level 3
	Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A130
	Privacy Act of 1974
	Health Information Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Act of 1996
The Contractor must hold a current International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001:2008 Certification for the digitization of government records from an accredited ISO certification organization. Additionally, to facilitate necessary quality assurance surveillance, the required services must be performed within the U.S. Capital Region.  The contractor shall be required to scan an estimated 5 -7 thousand STRs and deliver an estimated 1.08 million deliverable images per month.
  The resultant order will be for a base period of performance of 1 JAN through 30 JUN 2014 and will contain two six-month options.  

The required services do meet the FAR definition of commercial item. The government intends to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Subpart13.5.     
This is an interim action in support of a short-term solution and the resultant order will provide the requiring activity with the necessary services while the contracting office solicits and awards a contract or contracts in support of a long-term solution through competitive procedures.  Anacomp, Inc. is currently providing similar services in support of BUPERS and the VA and is the only known source that can reasonably be expected to begin performance of these services by 1 JAN.
   Anacomp is the only firm with the requisite facilities, equipment, personnel, expertise and capacity to immediately take on this effort. 

Failure to acquire these services from Anacomp, Inc. on a sole source basis will seriously jeopardize BUMED's ability to carry out its mission, will damage the continuity of care for Navy personnel transitioning to the VA, and will the delay the processing of claims and the provision of benefits to many eligible veterans.

In accordance with FAR 5.102(a), the solicitation will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil, even though the only response that will be considered is that from Anacomp, Inc.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 10 DEC 2013.
  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations/proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by 10 DEC 2013.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 561410 and the small business size standard is $14M.   Issuance of a competitive solicitation in support of a long-term solution is anticipated around 1 JUL 2014.
  For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Sean McGinley, Code 280.3A, at (215) 697-5025, or at sean.mcginley1@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support is soliciting a 5 year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA)   for the repair of  2 items that are part of the AAR-47 Missile Warning System by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) in Clearwater, FL Cage (06424).  ATK (Cage 06424) Clearwater, FL  is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.  February 2014 is the estimated award date of the resultant BOA.  The following are the 2 items for repair: Sensor, NSN 7RH-5865-015351515 estimated qty 100 ea, Sensor NSN 7RH-5865-015648246 estimated qty 100 ea. Foreign Military Sales are included. For any questions concerning this notice, contact Tangela Randolph 215-697-0277.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>1.0 Description
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force to facilitate decision making for potential future acquisitions. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Commodity Council (AFCECC) is seeking information on Personal Protective Equipment products and services in support of Air Force installations throughout Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside of Contiguous United States (OCONUS).</p>
<p>The AFCECC is part of the Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. The mission of the ESG is to provide the U.S. Air Force cross-functional installation strategic sourcing and acquisition solutions. The ESG is the Air Force's centralized organization for executing enterprise-wide strategic sourcing of goods and services for Air Force installations throughout the United States. They utilize strategic sourcing best practices to continually improve and re-evaluate organizational purchasing activities, to improve quality, and reduce costs for installation acquisition. The ESG uses cross-functional teams called "Commodity Councils" to strategically source goods and/or services at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>We are conducting market research into the personal protective equipment industry to better understand the capabilities of the supply base and obtain feedback on our projected personal protective equipment needs. The initial scope of this research includes 3 main categories and their respective items within:</p>
<p>Structural <br />- Helmet <br />- Hood<br />- Coat<br />- Gloves<br />- Pants<br />- Boots</p>
<p>Proximity <br />- Helmet <br />- Hood<br />- Coat<br />- Gloves<br />- Pants<br />- Boots</p>
<p>HazMat <br />- Chemical Vapor Protective Clothing Level "A" (NFPA 1991 compliant)<br />- Leak Test kit for Level "A" suits <br />- Chemical Splash Protective Clothing Level "B" (NFPA 1992/1994 compliant)<br />- Chemical-Resistant Gloves (per type)<br />- Disposable Foot Covers<br />- Chemical-Resistant Boots (per type)<br />- Cooling Vests<br />- Hard Hats<br />- Chin Straps<br />- Safety Glasses<br />- Safety Goggles<br />- Coveralls (Fire Retardant)<br />- Hearing protection for high level noise areas<br />- Personnel Decontamination Gowns<br />- Personnel Decontamination Clothing<br />- Personnel Decontamination Footwear<br />- Personnel Decontamination Towels<br />- Personnel Decontamination Blankets<br /><br />In addition, provide services that include inspection, maintenance, cleaning, and repair for CONUS and OCONUS Air Force Installations.</p>
<p>Currently, these products and services are typically procured, when needed, by each facility using a local base contracting office and GPC card holders. The AFCECC seeks to develop a long term strategic sourcing contract vehicle to satisfy demand so facilities may place orders as needs arise. By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, we will simplify the acquisition process and reduce the lead time in the ordering process for the requesting location. There has not been any final determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The AFCECC seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures for personal protective equipment throughout CONUS and OCONUS. As the AFCECC is analyzing the feasibility for an Air Force wide acquisition solution, preliminary research suggests that the scope might stretch the capabilities of small business. However, we seek both large and small business respondents who are interested in supporting the Air Force's needs. The input received will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors.</p>
<p>If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the questionnaire at <a href="http://www.mcix.com/fireppe">http://www.mcix.com/fireppe</a>. This will include providing the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information. We highly encourage all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough questionnaire in response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. Notice: The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, all of whom have signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.</p>
<p>The above link will direct you to the online questionnaire. For your convenience, there is a PDF document that has all the questions so you and your company can review prior to starting the online questionnaire. You will need to have information such as your company's DUNs number, CAGE code (if available), basic employee data, revenue data, etc. for the past 3 fiscal tax years (or as best approximated). The PDF document is for reference only. The online questionnaire will be the source tool for gathering responses, please use the best available information or estimates. If you need to stop the survey during any time, you will be able to resume your session using the same computer from which you started.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFCECC requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">www.fedbizopps.gov</a> for future announcements regarding future needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. The Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website can send automatic alerts when a notice is posted meeting established criteria. To subscribe to this service, vendors should establish a "search agent" within their registered account. Search agents can be established for any combination of criteria, be set to run at your desired frequency and will notify you of relevant opportunities. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the FBO site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>
<p>4.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to support Air Force market research by obtaining further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>5.0 Responses/Questions</p>
<p>Please complete the questionnaire no later 1 October 2012. Questions on this RFI may also be directed to these POCs listed below:</p>
<p><br />Mr. Joe Mamer <br />Contracting Specialist <br />771 ESS/EGA<br />joseph.mamer@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Mr. Brian Brown<br />Program Manager<br />771 ESS/EGA<br />brian.brown2@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>6.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. It is intended to identify sources that can provide information around capabilities for providing personal protective equipment needs.</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Air Force has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">. INTRODUCTION:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Bombs Division, Hill AFB, UT is seeking information in support of market research to identify defense industry partners specializing in the qualification and operational testing of penetrator insensitive munitions, or from qualified vendors that show expertise, capability, and facility infrastructure to perform test and analysis as determined by the requirements in section IV below. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Twenty-two Bomb Live Unit (BLU-109) production articles contain anomalies in the solid metal casing of the nose region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each anomaly was identified by Ellwood National Forge, the manufacturer of the BLU-109 bomb casing, using Non-Destructive inspection methods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is estimated, using the sample size of twenty-two BLU-109's collected, that approximately 2.5% of the current USAF inventory of BLU-109 penetrator munitions contain anomalies in the nose section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unknown if these anomalies negatively affect lethality, performance, or alter the Operational Suitability and Effectiveness of the weapon system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testing requirements in section IV below must be performed in order to determine if any variance exists from a known baseline performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Given the information above, the government is seeking qualified sources to install instrumentation in one inert test article using a government supplied anomalous-bomb casing and inert filler (Filler-E).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The completed test article will be fitted with an array of internal instrumentation and sensors that can withstand an impact at a sled test track and maintain integrity of all acquired data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The data will then be analyzed and used to build a qualitative conclusion of whether or not an anomalous nose section affects the performance criteria upon impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no solicitation available at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">II. BACKGROUND:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The BLU-109 has been in service and in Air Force inventory since 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As with other "bunker busters", it is intended to penetrate concrete structures or "bunkers" before exploding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A live BLU-109 has a delayed-action tail-fuze that ignites an explosive charge after the munition penetrates a hardened structure, such as concrete, of varied degrees of thickness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">III. SCOPE:</strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The desired test article will provide invaluable information and insight to how anomalies affect performance of the penetrator bombs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Test requirements specified in the TRD will be performed to meet a milestone date of completion no later than 28 April 2014.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The completed test article will be shipped to the test track facility at Holloman AFB, New Mexico two weeks prior a sled test date of 14 March 2014. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The scope of this project will include project planning, a comprehensive instrumentation, sensor, and gauging solution implementation plan, equipment procurement, Other Direct Costs (ODC) installation, installation, pre-test and post-test support and task documentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pre-test support will involve travel to the location where the test article will be filled with Filler-E.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">This RFI is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, integration, installation, and test of instrumentation, sensors, and gauging of insensitive munitions such as the BLU-109.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government recognizes that it, and Industry, has limited resources; therefore, to conserve those resources, at this point in the process, the Government desires to continue dialogue with those Industry partners who feel they could be a viable prime contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the strategy for the acquisition to complete the USAF testing and assess impact to 2.5% of penetrator munition inventory and will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It should also help interested contractors make more informed decisions as to their probability of success and determine whether or not they should proceed.</p>

<DESC>Introductory Paragraph: The purpose of this notice is to obtain market research information from the small business community which will assist the government in determining if there are two or more small business concerns, i.e., small business, 8(a) concern, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business that are capable of providing the described services. SBA endorsed joint ventures or teaming arrangement will be acceptable. The government's determination on how to compete the proposed requirement will be made based on responses to this notice and is at the sole discretion of the government. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 519120, professional, administrative and management support services, and the size standard is $7.0 million.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has a requirement for library support services for the Institute. The NIEHS library supports the mission of the Institute: to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. The purpose of this effort is to provide high quality library services to approximately 800 scientists, administrators, and program managers; both government and contractor in the David P. Rall Building on the main campus of the NIEHS as well as 300 additional employees located in the Keystone Building.</p>
<p>The library occupies approximately 1500 square feet within the main NIEHS building and includes a multi-disciplinary collection of approximately 15,000 books and as well as electronic access to numerous databases and over 8,000 journals made available through the NIH Library. The collection is multidisciplinary in scope, covering topics such as bioinformatics, molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicology, pathology, structural biology, public health, etc. In addition to the main print collection, the library catalogs and processes materials for two other collections: the pathology-related Rao Collection (455 items) and Work-Family Life Collection (388 items). The NIEHS collection is managed as part of a union catalog (Innovative Interface's Millennium Integrated Library System) with the NIH Library.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this effort is to provide high quality professional, administrative and management support services to the employees of the NIEHS. This includes maintaining a clean, safe and attractive library with qualified staff. A Library Manager, Reference Librarian, Library Fellow, and Technical Services Librarian currently perform the library functions. The Government shall furnish support for building maintenance, purchasing/maintenance/repair of supplies/equipment, and custodial services. IT contractors will provide support for computer services.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements: <br />Major tasks required include the following:<br />It is expected that the Contractor shall be proactive, responsive, and creative in fulfilling the performance requirements. Services will be performed at both NIEHS work locations (main campus and Keystone). The contractor shall have access to all materials and equipment necessary for performance of the contract. The library responds to inquiries from the public and is open to the public on a restricted basis. Library support services are to be provided to NIEHS during normal Government operating hours. <br />The contractor shall not be required to provide, or maintain these materials or equipment, including computer software. The Contractor shall focus on four (4) key areas of responsibility: <br />1. Library Management (oversight/practices); <br />2. Resource Management (planning/control); <br />3. Library Services (day-to-day operations); and <br />4. Measurement; Analysis, and Improvement (assess/adjust).<br />Library management responsibilities include providing evidence of its proactive and customer-oriented commitment to the development and implementation of policies, practices, and programs that support the effective and efficient operation of library services. <br />Resource management responsibilities include ensuring that resources essential to the implementation of strategy and the achievement of the NIEHS Library objectives are identified and made available. Resources may be people, infrastructure, work environment, electronic or print information resources, software, or financial resources. <br />Library Services provide customer-oriented, effective and efficient information services that directly support the NIEHS Library objectives. Effective services should improve mission results and customer satisfaction by meeting customer needs. Often needs include reference requests, conducting literature searchers, and resource instruction. Among the types of reference requests are quick references, citation verification, tracking down a document, determining publishing impact, setting up research alerts, designing search strategies, assisting with document management, and conducting both specific as well as comprehensive literature searches. The literature searches directly support the research being conducted at the Institute. The search results may be used to publish a review of the literature, identify gaps in a research area, locate a new protocol, or provide background reading for a new research area. In addition, numerous instructional courses are offered on a regular basis. <br />Measurement, analysis, and improvement responsibilities include a Contractor-provided Quality Control Plan (QCP) that describes how the Contractor will monitor, analyze, and improve library services and improve customer satisfaction by meeting customer needs. A draft QCP will be required as part of their proposal and a final plan within sixty (60) days of contract award.</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance: It is anticipated that the period of performance will be five (5) years, base year with four (4) option years and one (1) six month option to extend services if necessary. The anticipated period of performance is scheduled to begin on July 9, 2014.</p>

<p><strong><br />Introduction:<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.<br /><br /><strong>Background Information:<br /></strong>According to the Institute of Medicine Report, over 100 million people in the U.S. still suffer from unwanted pain at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars each year in indirect costs and direct medical expenses. As a result of this, there has been a great increase in the number of treatments available for chronic pain management. Yet in many cases it is not known which treatments are most effective or safest. This information could be obtained through comparative effectiveness studies which could be developed with a Pain Registry. Pain Registries currently exist, but they are commercial products with expensive fees placing them out of the reach of many potential users. The National Institutes of Health is interested in implementing a free open source and open standard National Pain Registry. This work was begun via a contract with Stanford University and sources are now sought to support continued development of National Pain Registry requirements.&nbsp;<br /> <br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br /></strong>The purpose of this potential requirement is acquisition of support to continue development of an open source, open framework, and freely available National Pain Registry. This work will promote widespread collection of patient outcomes data for point of care decision making and longitudinal assessments of treatment efficacy.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong>The Contractor must be able to perform the following tasks:<br /><br />1. Provide pain medicine experts and computer experts to further refine the currently developed functional Pain Registry prototype using NIDA PROMIS CAT modules. <br />2. Beta-test the prototype Pain Registry.<br />3. Contact other pain medicine practices for data contributions.<br />4. Analyze data to provide assessment on longitudinal treatment effectiveness outcomes. <br />5. Scale Pain Registry for installation, configuration, integration, operation, and maintenance at multiple sites.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is 1/1/2014 through 6/30/2014. <br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement:<br /></strong>Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist. Contractors should also provide their Company Name, DUNS number, Physical Address, and Point of Contact Information. <br /><br />Interested organizations are <strong>required</strong> to identify their type of business, applicable North American Industry Classification System Code, and size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.<br /><br /><strong>Note:<br /></strong>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

SECTION II STATEMENT OF WORK
1. Project Description
The National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is responsible for conducting studies of the exposure of environmental stressors on ecosystem and human health.  Landscape ecology is an interdisciplinary science framework that studies the relationship between spatial patterns of landscape characteristics and conditions of and risks to ecological resources, including forests, rangelands, wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, and urban environmental settings. Local, regional, national, and global economies depend upon both goods and services resulting from ecological resources. Forests provide materials for many different types of paper products; agricultural systems provide food for the world population; coastal waters provide an abundant food resource; wetlands, streams, and rivers provide numerous recreational opportunities. An ecosystem, or landscape, approach provides a comprehensive basis for identifying and evaluating current and historical land use practices. In this study  we are focusing on riparian function which is heavily influenced by the condition of adjacent and upland ecosystems. Analyzing spatial relationships and short- and long-term trends can determine if goals and objectives are being met. It will also determine what changes are needed in moving the ecosystem towards the desired condition and developing future management alternatives.
Disturbance occurring within a watershed or adjacent to a stream corridor typically produces a causal effect, which may permanently alter one or more characteristics of a stream?s function, which depends on vegetation composition, soils and geomorphology and hydrology. Disruption of the natural water cycle will lead to hydrologic alterations such as increased volume and velocity of runoff, frequency of severity of flooding, chemical concentrations, decreases in natural runoff storage capacity in vegetation, wetlands and soil, and reduced groundwater discharge. 
The hydrologic, physical and ecological alterations resulting from terrestrial activity can have a pronounced impact to the natural function of a stream, lake and wetland. Water quality and biological communities are affected if a streams function is impaired. A stream?s shape evolves over time in response to flow and sediment loads. Increased volume and intensity of runoff leads to stream bank erosion resulting in streams becoming straighter, wider and shallower, reducing pool habitat and fish cover, and destroying riparian vegetation.
As a part of this effort, the Environmental Sciences Division is developing specific approaches to  assessing ecological function using Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), State and Tribal Water Quality and Biological Data. 
2. Description of Student Services:
The student will work within a multi-disciplinary research team and will provide technical ecological, Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing support for research projects characterizing the exposure of environmental stressors on riparian systems 
Specific duties will include assisting research staff in (1) Conducting field surveys including monitoring and recording of physical parameters and biological observations on riparian areas; (2) Photographic analysis; (3) Satellite imagery analysis; and (4) Geographic information system (Landscape metric generation) analysis and other duties necessary to carry out the studies.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments for the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Ft. Campbell, KY area.  The project consists of construction of a new Fort Campbell High School.  The MULTI story structure will be comprised of approximately 184,232 square feet.  The project will utilize clear span or similar construction methods to allow large, open, flexible spaces and will incorporate fully integrated acoustical rated operable wall partitions which contribute to the overall acoustical performance of the building.   The project will include 21st Century School concepts such as learning neighborhoods, central hubs surrounded by learning studios, flex labs, information center, gymnasium, food service area, computer lab, supply areas, specialist rooms, art room, music room, a performance theatre, commons area for dining and social networking, learning impaired room, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage, administrative offices and other required areas for a fully functioning facility.  The project also includes related infrastructure such as parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, covered walkways, playgrounds and site improvements.  The facility will require enhanced commissioning upon completion to validate energy performance and must obtain LEED Silver certification.  The contract duration is anticipated at 660 calendar days. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f).  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:   <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.   <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  Reference:  Provision:  52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  <br>  <br> Of particular interest to the Government, the Government Requests responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Ft. Campbell, KY area? <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisiville District contract? <br>  <br> Responses shall be submitted via email to Brenna Crawford at Brenna.a.crawford@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM EST on 23 December 2013. <br> This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey. <br>

<DESC>1. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Force Protection Division hereby requests proposals for a five-year multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Force Protection Site Security Systems (FPS3) contract.
<p><br />2. The Force Protection Site Security Systems (FPS3) contract provides for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of a family of Integrated Base Defense Security Systems (IBDSS) including:</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed site Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)<br />&bull; Tactical security systems such as the Tactical Automated Security Systems (TASS)<br />&bull; Delay/denial systems such as the Remote Target Engagement System (RTES)</p>
<p>These systems provide electronic capabilities to support and enhance security and assist Security Forces (SF) in protecting assets and personnel at nuclear and non-nuclear fixed and tactical sites around the world. Their goal is to provide SF with the capability to "See First, Understand First, and Act First."</p>
<p>Fixed site IDS projects are driven by unit requirements and are tailored to fit the Protection Level (PL) requirements of assigned resources at each site where they are installed. These projects may be as simple as purchasing equipment to satisfy a user's needs or as complex as providing for design, installation, test, and sustainment of a system of hardware and software to protect an entire base. They provide an electronic means to accomplish area intrusion detection, alarm reporting and display, remote alarm assessment, and alert SF to intrusions to enhance resource and facility protection. Fixed-Site systems are delivered as permanent security systems to protect high priority assets, with a focus on PL 1 (nuclear and non-nuclear), 2, 3, and 4 resources such as aircraft, munitions, command and control centers, etc.</p>
<p>The FPS3 contract provides for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of tactical security systems such as TASS, a rapidly deployable, re-locatable and integrated security system designed as a "first-in" capability for a variety of force protection missions. TASS has been fielded and is currently sustained at forward-operating locations worldwide.</p>
<p>The FPS3 contract will also provide for acquisition, upgrade and sustainment of delay/denial systems such RTES, which provide final access denial to high-value assets at specified nuclear systems locations.</p>
<p>3. The contract is intended to allow for set-aside for small business on individual delivery orders. The Government intends to award two (2), or more or less, contracts to small business concerns and three (3), or more or less, contracts to other than small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561621, with a size standard of $19M.</p>
<p>4. Military sensitive technologies and export controlled data inherent to the execution of the FPS3 IDIQ cannot and will not be made available to foreign companies or countries. The Foreign Disclosure Office has determined that foreign participation will not be permitted for the FPS3 effort.</p>
<p>5. Please address all questions exclusively to Contract Specialist, Mr. Brayden Burroughs, (781) 225-1748, e-mail: Brayden.burroughs@hanscom.af.mil or the PCO, Ms. Elizabeth Baker at (781) 225-5514, e-mail: Elizabeth.baker@hanscom.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, has a requirement for Sirona Cerec Connect DoD Portal Support.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sirona Dental, Inc. operating as an Other Than Small Business located in Long Island City, NY under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Soliciting from a single source, only one source reasonable available.  <br>  <br> Sirona Cerec Connect is a technology that allows dentists to transmit digital dental impressions electronically to a laboratory for production.  The U.S. Army Dental Command (DENCOM) currently utilizes the Sirona Cerec Connect DoD Portal on a limited basis.  DENCOM expects to significantly expand the use of the Sirona Cerec Connect DoD Portal in the next year and requires support from Sirona Dental, Inc. to successfully achieve their objective.  The Sirona Cerec Connect DoD Portal is a proprietary technology which was developed and is available only from Sirona Dental, Inc.  In addition, Sirona Dental, Inc. is the only vendor who has the properly trained and certified personnel capable of providing the support required.  A change in vendors would require full replacement of the current portal as well as the related software and clinical hardware.  This would result in a significant disruption to service member treatments and would be highly cost prohibitive for the Government.     <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339114.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 3843 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500.  This is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The Government anticipates awarding one (1) Firm Fixed Price Contract.  All questions must be directed to Ms. Yvette M. Daltorio, Procurement Specialist, via email at yvette.m.daltorio.ctr@mail.mil.   The closing date of this notice is 16 December 2013. <br>

<a href="mailto:constance.reedus@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Washington</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir Division, on behalf of the Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) intends to negotiate with Non-Intrusive Technology, Inc. (NIITEK) 23031 Ladbrook Drive Dulles, VA, on a sole source basis to provide Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Technology Development.  Specifically, NIITEK will provide support of the enhancement of downward-looking GPR technologies to achieve advanced capabilities for real time detection of buried high and low antitank landmines and Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from ground based vehicles moving at tactical speeds in support of route clearance missions.  Route clearance is critical to the Army's combat and logistics supply capability.  Downward-looking GPR technology, such as that employed by the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS), provides a counter-IED system with the capabilities to detect underbelly IEDs and antitank landmines buried in primary and secondary roads.  As a result, the HMDS is vital to Route Clearance Packages (RCP).  HMDS uses an advanced, high-performance GPR to detect both non-metallic and metal-cased buried threats, including IEDs constructed of bulk explosives and low-metal pressure plates.  Current HMDS performance is limited by the ability of the GPR to detect targets at deeper depths and by the requirement to maintain a standoff distance from sources of potential electromagnetic interference (EMI) such as electric jammers.  The advanced technologies being pursued under the Digital GPR program will address these performance limitations. <br> The estimated period of performance is twenty-four (24) months.  The resultant contract will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).  It has been determined that NIITEK, Inc. is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only One Responsible Source.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  All proposals received within 15 days will be considered by the Government.  Responses shall be no longer than ten (10) pages and shall be in a Microsoft Word compatible format.  All responses and requests for further information shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Constance Reedus at constance.r.reedus.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br>

<CONTACT>Sean M Palmer, Senior Contracting Specialist, Email sean.m.palmer@navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for the initial development of the "Acute Care Cover for Severely Injured Limbs" (ACCSIL). ACCSIL will be an advanced field dressing with capabilities beyond those currently available today for battlefield care of severely injured arms or legs. It is intended for application by corpsmen/medics/first responders at the point of injury and removal by medical care providers at Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) that can provide definitive care. ACCSIL is intended for use on a wide variety of severe injuries including: avulsions, amputations, lacerations, compound and other fractures, thermal and chemical burns, deglovings, deep and widespread abrasions, etc. This product will preserve viable tissue and diminish post-injury, negative, secondary sequelae in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. ACCSIL is intended to preserve the tissues of the injured limb in the best possible state during delays prior to evacuation and during evacuation itself. Optimally, at the time ACCSIL is removed, the limb, although injured, will be as fresh, well perfused, viable, and uninfected as at the moment of injury. <br /><br />The final product will consist of two independent components: a) a conformal cover to serve as a physical barrier to contain/protect the remaining tissue, and b) an internal bioactive coating consisting of several pharmacological interventions to mitigate progressive injury and aid in preserving tissue, limb and systemic health.
<p>Each of the two components, the conformal cover and the internal bioactive coating, should be considered separate products that can be developed and utilized alone. However, the intention is to combine the products into a single solution with the conformal cover and internal bioactive coating integrated, packaged and applied together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Applicants shall apply using ONRBAA14-001.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AN/TSQ-216 Mobile Electric Power Generation Replacement   1. Introduction  1.1. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) is seeking information regarding the replacement of the AN/TSQ-216 Mobile Electric Generators. 1.2. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, the Navy is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor that web site for additional information pertaining to this RFI or a requirement that may relate to this RFI. 2. Background  2.1. The Navy is contemplating a replacement of the Mobile Electric Power generators for the AN/TSQ-216 Remote Landing Site Tower (RLST).  The RLST is a world-wide deployable asset that provides Visual Flight Rules (VFR) control of military aircraft at Forward Operating Bases, Forward Air Refueling and Rearming Points and other such rudimentary landing zones.  The RLST consists of a portable air traffic control operations shelter that sits in the back of a HMMWV and a trailer that carries communications and power generating equipment.  The RLST is self contained in that its power is provided either by portable generators that are part of the system or the 24 VDC of the HMMWV. The Mobile Electric Power generators provide electric power for the operations shelter and communications equipment either in a collocated configuration or a split site configuration which requires electric power at two separate locations.  2.2. The specifications for the Mobile Electric Power generators are attached and the replacement generators must be able to fit within the confines of the RLST trailer while it is in transportation mode. The replacement generator must be compatible with F-76 Military Diesel Fuel.  The Mobile Electric Power generators do not have to be identical if a solution is available that meets size and weight restrictions contained in the specification sheet while otherwise providing the necessary power requirements in the split site equipment configuration. In a split site configuration, the operations shelter requires only the a.c. output outlined in the specification sheet, while the trailer/radio site only requires the d.c. output outlined in the specification sheet.  3. Responses:  3.1. Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper not to exceed 10 pages. White papers shall be submitted in Microsoft Word .doc or .docx formats, Times New Roman 11-point or 12-point font, with 1-inch margins, minimum, all around. Figures, schematics, drawings, diagrams and tables may be in a smaller type size, but shall be no smaller than 8-point. All narrative text must be single-spaced. Figures, schematics, drawings, diagrams, schedule charts, and tables may also be single-spaced. 3.2. White Paper Responses containing data or information not to be disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the Government except for market research shall include statements to that effect on the first/title page and on each page that contains such data or information. Respondents bear sole responsibility for clearly marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. To aid the Government, sources are requested to segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. 3.3. White Paper Responses should be prepared IAW format specified in 3.1 and should simply and economically provide a straightforward, concise delineation of respondent's capabilities and an approach needed to replace the mobile electric power generators as described in this RFI. White Paper Responses should address the following:  3.3.1. A company description and discussion of company capabilities with respect to fulfilling the objectives outlined in this RFI.  Please include your business type/size for NAICS 333611. 3.3.2. A description of previous experience in this field with either commercial or government customers. 3.3.3. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for cost and schedule to deliver one set of generators. The ROM should, to the extent practicable, delineate non-recurring engineering (NRE). 3.3.4. Any additional information that will assist in understanding your responses to the RFI. 3.3.5. Respondents are encouraged to provide comment with respect to the following:  3.3.5.1. Technical aspects described herein that are either too vague or overly-burdensome and the reason(s) for commenting on those aspects; 3.3.5.2. Technical or contractual aspects that you feel that the government should consider before formally soliciting proposals for systems conceptually outlined in this RFI; 3.3.5.3. Information regarding the availability of commercial technical manuals, supply and provisioning data, applicable data rights limitations, and available reliability and maintainability data of the product. 3.4. All questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted via email to richard.hammersmith@navy.mil. 3.5. White Paper Responses are due no later than 16 January 2014, 1400pm PST, and shall be delivered to Richard Hammersmith via email at richard.hammersmith@navy.mil. 3.6. Industry Response / Clarifications: SSC Pacific Contracts representatives may or may not choose to contact potential offerors.

Neither the Contractor nor any of its employees shall disseminate, or disclose any information concerning the operations and activities of the WCF and its tenants, that could result in or increase the likelihood of a breach of the facility's perimeter, internal security, or interrupt the continuity of its operations. The Government reserves the right to seek from the Contractor costs incurred by the Government to mitigate damages resulting from any breach of security by Contractor personnel. <br />c. Security Access General Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Contractor and Subcontractor employees requiring access to the BEP be subject to a background investigation and favorable adjudication. They must also be "identity proofed" in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD 12). Personal identity verification will be performed before assignment to perform work under the contract. All positions under the contract will be assigned a "position sensitivity level." Position sensitivity levels range from HIGH RISK to LOW RISK. Position sensitivity levels are determined based on access to currency manufacturing areas and processes required by the position. The BEP COR will coordinate with the Security Division to determine appropriate position sensitivity levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the BEP COR a list of all persons under employment consideration, to include the full legal name, date, city, state and country of birth. The Security Division will establish an electronic profile of the individual within e-QIP (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigative Processing). Once the e-QIP profile has been established it must be accessed within 10 days. After the initial access of e-QIP, all online security forms must be completed within 14 days.</p>
<p>After all initial security processing has been completed employee will be granted an interim access determination and will be allowed to perform limited assignments pending completion of the background investigation and adjudication; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable determination for level of access required, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. Upon contract award the contractor's employees designated to provide services under this contract will be provided the following forms, considered a Security Package, for completion. The completed Security Package shall be submitted to the COR within 5 calendar days after contract award.</p>
<p>(a) Department of Treasury Form TD67.32.5, Authority for Release of Information.</p>
<p>(b) Optional Form 306, Declaration for Federal Employment.</p>
<p>(c) Form SF 85P - High Risk.</p>
<p>(d) Form SF 85P-S, Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(e) Form FD 258, Fingerprint Card (2).</p>
<p>(f) FCRA, Release Form, Credit Report.</p>
<p>(g) Police and Criminal History Release Form.</p>
<p>(2) The BEP reserves the right to deny access to its facilities and security systems, in accordance with adjudicative guidelines set forth in Executive Order 10450, its amendments, and any applicable supplemental directives (in particular, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 731), to any individual about whom an adverse suitability determination is made. Failure to submit the required security package or to truthfully answer all questions shall constitute grounds for denial of access clearance. The Contractor shall not provide access to employees, until the Security Division, provides written access clearance through the COR.</p>
<p>(3) BEP Contractors are responsible for reporting adverse information, i.e., arrests, that may affect the employment suitability of their employees. This information shall be reported to the COR within five (5) days of the contractor becoming aware of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) Upon approval of the security clearances, the Contractor shall be given written confirmation from either the COR or the Contracting Officer that the individual(s) have been cleared to work at BEP.</p>
<p>(5) Contractor employees who have been cleared and are working onsite at BEP's facility will be subject to an annual criminal history check. The results of the annual criminal history check will be reviewed according to the same standards as the initial investigation conducted by the WCF Security Division. The annual criminal history checks will be utilized to identify potentially disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks identify disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks cannot be performed by BEP due to non-submission of the required information by Contractor employees.</p>
<p>(6) The contractor must provide a security package to the COR for any potential hires to replace an employee previously cleared to work at BEP. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that an interim access clearance has been approved and the potential employee can be employed on this contract. The employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable access determination for high risk positions, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that a final access clearance has been approved and the potential employee will be issued an identification badge and allowed access to previously restricted areas.</p>
<p>(7) Some of the work to be performed may require access to restricted data and classified National Security information, compartmentalized information, restricted physical areas, and classified systems. All individuals proposed to perform requirements involving such access must have the appropriate security clearances, as designated by the BEP, at the time that the specific tasking is initiated. These requirements will be identified on a case by case basis and discussed between the COR and Contracting Officer prior to the start of the assignment. The contractor must show how these requirements will be met and the depth of corporate resources available to respond to ongoing requirements.</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(end of clause)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2013) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability. Technical Capability - Technical capability will be evaluated based on the offeror's knowledge of the tasks and deliverables as stated in the performance work statement and RFP, as well as the offeror's capability for transforming its understanding into successful performance under the resultant contract; displaying an understanding of the tasks and deliverables in the performance work statement; describe familiarity working with HSPD-12(Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12) Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Badges; quality assurance surveillance plan to ensure that deliverables are met as demonstrated in the technical capability section of their submissions; and a transition plan (incoming and outgoing) that explains how the offeror will ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Management Approach - Management approach will be evaluated based upon offeror's knowledge and understanding of the requirements set forth in the performance work statement and RFP as it relates to organizing, staffing, and managing the tasks and deliverables; qualifications of key personnel (ie. project manager, team supervisor, and other relevant key positions) describing their experience in office administrative services in the management approach section of their submission.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Past Performance - The offeror should identify other federal government contracts, and should describe the past experience of their company in providing similar support services as specified in this solicitation within the past three (3) years. If contractor has not held 3 previous federal government contracts of this nature, may list state and local contracts, or comparable private experience. Provide a list of three (3) references pertaining to those contracts including the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's Name<br />&bull; Contract Number and Contract Type<br />&bull; Original Contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options)<br />&bull; Original and final completion date<br />&bull; A description of the contract effort<br />&bull; The relevance of this contract to the current procurement<br />Point of contact including telephone number</p>
<p>The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor <br />unfavorably.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Experience - Experience will be evaluated based on offeror submission of recent relevant experience with similar types of services/work. A description of accomplishments in relation to office administrative service efforts shall be verifiable and specific enough to show the scope and relevance of the projects.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Price -The Offeror's price will be evaluated including the total price of the base year, and four option years. The proposal will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation, as well as for price reasonableness.</p>
<p>The non-price factors of technical capability, management approach, past performance, and experience when combined are more important than price. <br />PURPOSE OF TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: The technical proposal will primarily determine the qualifications and capability of the offeror to participate in this contract. It should be specific and complete in every detail. The proposal should be concise and provide sufficient information to demonstrate the offeror's capacity to satisfactorily perform the task outlined in the solicitation. No price information shall be included in the technical proposal. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Evaluation Ratings<br />Each non-price criteria will be rated as follows:<br />1. Unacceptable ; proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies; fails to meet performance or capability standards; an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements</p>
<p>2. Marginal; Overall quality cannot be determined due to errors, omissions or deficiencies; only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal performance; high degree of risk in successfully meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>3. Good: Adequate quality; demonstrates good understanding of requirement and approach that meets performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed contain minor issues or concerns; moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>4. Outstanding ; Outstanding in all aspects; offers one or more significant advantages not offset by disadvantages; significantly exceeded performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed had very few minor issues or concerns; very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be rated as:</p>
<p>1. Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>2. Moderate Risk - Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>3. High Risk - Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>4. Unknown Risk - Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays will be established approximately April 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,545,734.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Of the 35 product groups, 5 represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those 5 items, all are considered requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 61.36% ($948,515.00) of the total volume in sales ($1,545,734.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Foley &amp; Urethral Catheter Kits/Trays requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics).

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

<CONTACT>Dr Dennis Polla, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-13-04@iarpa.gov
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Synopsis:</strong></span><br /><br />IARPA  is  interested  in  developing  an  ability  to  rapidly  assess  an  individual's  potential involvement in chemical or biological weapons (CBW) related activities.  The Bio-Intelligence Chips Program (BIC) intends to develop new analytical approaches to assessment based on cross-correlating multiple biomarkers found in physiological fluids to assay human exposure to agents and activities indicative of CBW production and handling.  BIC performers will identify signatures associated with specific threat hypotheses that comprise sets of biomarkers corresponding to exposures consonant with particular CBW involvement scenarios. BIC targets design and development of bioassays that can rapidly (in &le;30 min) identify biomarkers from a small amount of human sample (&le;100 &#61549;L).  It is not required that final results be demonstrated on a portable platform; however future scalability to a portable platform should be described. CBW threats of interest fall into three categories: a) virus, b) bacteria, and c) toxin-derived from bacteria or chemicals.
<p><br />BIC is interested in omni-omic expressions encompassing, but not limited to, genomics, transcriptomics,  proteomics,  metabolomics,  epigenomics,  microbiomics,  immunomics, glycomics, and lipodomics. The best known of these omics categories is genomics, which deals with bioinformatic data developed from the analysis of DNA sequences.  The other categories include: (1) transcriptomics, the analysis of information derived from RNA transcription levels of expressed genes within a cell population; (2) proteomics, the analysis of expressed proteins and their associated modifications; (3) metabolomics, the analysis of levels of metabolites (small organic molecules, including regulatory peptides) associated with the maintenance of homeostasis; (4) epigenomics, the study of heritable changes that are not directly encoded in DNA sequences; (5) microbiomics, the analysis of the species, numbers, and locations of parasitic and commensal organisms, e.g., bacteria that live endosymbiotically with their hosts; (6) immunomics, the analysis of information pertaining to changes in the immune system, particularly those associated with adaptive immunity; (7) glycomics, the analysis of all glycan structures in an organism including the glycan's interaction with lectins and other biomolecules; and  (8)  lipodomics,  the  analysis  of  pathways  and  networks  of  cellular  lipids  in  biological systems, including the quantification of lipids, the analysis of their conjugates (e.g., glycans) and their interactions with proteins, metabolites and other lipids.</p>
<p>The expected duration of the BIC program in its entirety is five years.  This solicitation, however, seeks responses to only Phase I of the program, which will be 24 months in duration.  During this period IARPA seeks to identify sets of omni-omic signatures for CBW threats of interest.</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>``Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number'' means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>``Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number'' means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC" or "Commission") uses competitive bidding to assign spectrum licenses when it accepts mutually exclusive applications for any initial license or construction permit. Since the development of the Commission's current auction system, the Commission's needs have evolved in ways that were unanticipated. The current auction system is at the end of its lifecycle and has limitations for use with advanced auction design formats. The auction bidding formats used with the current system have been for simultaneous multiple round (SMR) auctions (with and without package bidding), one single-round sealed bid auction, and one single round sealed bid reverse auction. The Commission is aggressively pursuing an effort to modernize its auction capabilities to meet its current and anticipated auction process needs and to incorporate design and technology advances.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States USCG Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695.</p>

<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with characters other than "SU" denotes that the union classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local union number or district council number where applicable , i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the example, is an internal number used in processing the wage determination.<br />The date, 07/01/2011, following these characters is the effective date of the most current negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the rates.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived from survey data by computing average rates and are not union rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007 5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union majority rates, LA indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an interested party (those affected by the action) can request review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OFDA provides non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  The Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team (HPGE) serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement and institutional relationships with IO and other donor governments.  HPGE tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action to DCHA; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with implementing partners; leads OFDA's communications and social media outreach; and serves as the primary interlocutor on strategic issues with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues.</p>
<p>The Interagency Team Leader position serves as an integral part of the HPGE team and closely coordinates with other parts of the U.S. Government (USG) community on humanitarian issues.  The position assists in planning DCHA strategies and responses to humanitarian crises; leads efforts to strengthen strategic institutional relationships with other federal agencies, including oversight for new program development and partnerships; and is responsible for executing training for senior officials; provides guidance on policy issues pertaining to the interagency; prepares key briefings and guidance; and manages the interagency team.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of an Interagency Team Leader in order to meet its objectives of coordination within the USG, developing new relationships and partnerships; programming; and managing institutional relationships with partner organizations within the USG.</p>

The assignment requires providing expert analytical and advisory support on a wide range of humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy objectives within a broad and complex environment.

<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in IOs and other agencies, experts, and representatives of NGOs.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Interagency Team Leader may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive experience with and a thorough understanding of the international humanitarian assistance environment, operations, related policies, regulations, and inter-relationships among the USG, donor and other IOs.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br /> <br /> Michael Clark <br />Contracting Officer<br />&emsp;<br />Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor (USPSC) Democracy Officer - Generalist (Multiple Positions)</p>
<p>1.  SOLICITATION NO.: SOL-OCR-14-000003</p>
<p>2.  ISSUANCE DATE: December 5, 2013</p>
<p>3.  CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: December 19, 5:00 pm EST</p>
<p>4.  POSITION TITLE: Democracy Officer - Generalist</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent hourly/daily rate ($40.58 - $52.76/$324.64 -$422.08- not eligible for locality pay).  Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) year, with four (4) option years</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Civilian Response (OCR) "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OCR supervisor according to requests made to OCR by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC solicitation. There is no obligation by OCR to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, OCR will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to OCR or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify OCR whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify OCR at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist OCR in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from OCR and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Overseas<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training program in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training and security training. After completion of appropriate training, the Democracy Officer - Generalist will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Civilian Response (OCR) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, internal conflict or otherwise in need of surge staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, OCR provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo, and many other countries. As a member of OCR's team of crisis responders, you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.</p>
<p>USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to crises. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing yet timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. OCR plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs, OCR retains a group of high level professionals and experts under (USPSCs) as part of a "Firehouse". These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are rapidly available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, replace evacuated staff, or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. OCR staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach, reporting, and strategic planning, and others. As a member of the "Firehouse" you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This acquisition will use Simplified Acquisition Methods in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3. This announcement, with its attachments, constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Contract financing is NOT provided for in this acquisition. The Government intends to make multiple award BPA pursuant to this solicitation to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award without discussions and the Government reserves the right to make no award at all depending upon the quality of offers received.</div>
<p><strong>Solicitation Number</strong>: The solicitation number for this requirement is <strong>FA8601-14-R-0009</strong>.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is <strong>325120</strong> and the associated small business size standard is: <strong>1,000 employee size standard</strong>. This requirement has not been set-aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Wright-Patterson AFB requires compressed gases and cylinders for use as well as refill government cylinders for compressed gases. Items are to be provided in accordance with "Requirements for Compressed Gas" document dated 25 Oct 2013, which is located at attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 5 Sep 2013 through 4 Sep 2014. The BPA will be written for a period of 4 years, during which the Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA. Therefore, a BPA does not include any minimum purchase requirement or maximum dollar limitation. The Government is not obligated to make any calls against the BPA, which may be cancelled by the Government or the contractor in accordance with the cancellation terms specified in the BPA Terms of Agreement. For additional information on BPAs refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.303. <br /><br />All prospective awardees are required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract.

A DUNS number will be provided immediately by telephone at no charge to the offeror. For information on obtaining a DUNS number, the offeror, if located within the United States, should call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505.

<p>Section H - Special Contract Requirements</p>
<p><br />H.1 Conduct of Work</p>
<p>The personnel employed by the Contractor shall be capable employees qualified in this type of work. The contractor shall be responsible for all damage to BEP property by the activities of employees assigned to these operations. The Contract Officer may require removal from work on this contract any employee(s) that may be deemed incompetent , careless, insubordinate, unsuitable, or otherwise objectionable, or whose chose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of the security of the BEP.</p>
<p>H.2 Security Requirements</p>
<p>The contract requires Contractor/Sub-Contractor employees to work onsite at BEP's Western Currency Facility (WCF). Contractor employees are required to comply with all security procedures and follow instructions from Police and Security personnel. In the event conflicts arise between Police/Security instructions and the contract, Police/Security instructions will take precedence. Contractor employees experiencing conflicts with instructions must contact the COR immediately to resolve the conflict before performing work that would result in a contract change or incur additional costs for the government. While on Bureau properties contractor employees are subject to the same standards that govern Bureau employees conduct. Contractors are expected to know and follow Bureau facility visitor access and escort policies requirements at all times. A failure to follow security policies and instructions may result in a citation being issued for a security violation and/or access authorization being withdrawn. Security requirements for specific processes are identified below.</p>
<p>a. Employee Behavior. <br />(1) Conduct. Contract personnel shall not, at any time during the contract period, represent themselves as employees or agents of the U.S. Government. Contract personnel shall conduct themselves at all times in a proper, friendly, efficient, courteous, businesslike manner, and are subject to the same rules and regulations as BEP employees. See employee handbook "Conduct" section. <br />(2) Dress. Contract personnel shall dress uniformly so as to identify the person as an employee of that contract. If the contract calls for uniform to be worn the name of the Contractor shall be prominently displayed on the wearer. <br />(3) Drug Free Workplace. The Contractor shall be compliant with all aspects of a drug-free workplace as prescribed in FAR 52.223-6.<br />(4) Impaired Employee. Any Contractor employee or sub Contractor employee determined to be impaired by the supervisor or COR or otherwise unable to perform the full range of duties and responsibilities of their position shall be relieved from the work assignment and replaced. <br />b. Security<br />(1) Securing Facilities. The Contractor shall secure the Government facilities at any time the facility is not occupied to protect its contents and information. In the event a contract employee finds an area or facility under their control that is not secure they must notify the Police Command Center immediately. Failure to comply with facility security requirements may require the Government to conduct an investigation to determine if the facility and its contents to include information were compromised. The Contractor shall be responsible for the Government's labor cost of the investigator and investigator's assistants. The Government labor cost is calculated from the employee's basic pay, plus benefits and overhead. <br />(2) Denial of Employee Entry. The BEP may deny any person access to its facility that is identified as a threat or potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being, general order or operational mission of the BEP and/or the BEP's employees. This denial will not relieve the Contractor of its responsibilities under the terms and conditions of this contract.<br />(3) Badges. Contractor personnel shall retain a Government-issued access badge and shall present it upon request by any Government employee. The Contractor shall return access badges to the COR or designated representative upon Contract termination or termination of an employee. The badge will be worn in accordance with employee handbook "Access Badge" section.<br />(4) Breach of Security (Information Security). Contractor personnel taking any action that does not comply with the rules, regulations, or guidelines set forth in the BEP Security Manual, or leads to a breach of security, shall be considered a security violation. Neither the Contractor nor any of its employees shall disseminate, or disclose any information concerning the operations and activities of the WCF and its tenants, that could result in or increase the likelihood of a breach of the facility's perimeter, internal security, or interrupt the continuity of its operations. The Government reserves the right to seek from the Contractor costs incurred by the Government to mitigate damages resulting from any breach of security by Contractor personnel. <br />c. Security Access General Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Contractor and Subcontractor employees requiring access to the BEP be subject to a background investigation and favorable adjudication. They must also be "identity proofed" in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD 12). Personal identity verification will be performed before assignment to perform work under the contract. All positions under the contract will be assigned a "position sensitivity level." Position sensitivity levels range from HIGH RISK to LOW RISK. Position sensitivity levels are determined based on access to currency manufacturing areas and processes required by the position. The BEP COR will coordinate with the Security Division to determine appropriate position sensitivity levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the BEP COR a list of all persons under employment consideration, to include the full legal name, date, city, state and country of birth. The Security Division will establish an electronic profile of the individual within e-QIP (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigative Processing). Once the e-QIP profile has been established it must be accessed within 10 days. After the initial access of e-QIP, all online security forms must be completed within 14 days.</p>
<p>After all initial security processing has been completed employee will be granted an interim access determination and will be allowed to perform limited assignments pending completion of the background investigation and adjudication; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable determination for level of access required, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. Upon contract award the contractor's employees designated to provide services under this contract will be provided the following forms, considered a Security Package, for completion. The completed Security Package shall be submitted to the COR within 5 calendar days after contract award.</p>
<p>(a) Department of Treasury Form TD67.32.5, Authority for Release of Information.</p>
<p>(b) Optional Form 306, Declaration for Federal Employment.</p>
<p>(c) Form SF 85P - High Risk.</p>
<p>(d) Form SF 85P-S, Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(e) Form FD 258, Fingerprint Card (2).</p>
<p>(f) FCRA, Release Form, Credit Report.</p>
<p>(g) Police and Criminal History Release Form.</p>
<p>(2) The BEP reserves the right to deny access to its facilities and security systems, in accordance with adjudicative guidelines set forth in Executive Order 10450, its amendments, and any applicable supplemental directives (in particular, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 731), to any individual about whom an adverse suitability determination is made. Failure to submit the required security package or to truthfully answer all questions shall constitute grounds for denial of access clearance. The Contractor shall not provide access to employees, until the Security Division, provides written access clearance through the COR.</p>
<p>(3) BEP Contractors are responsible for reporting adverse information, i.e., arrests, that may affect the employment suitability of their employees. This information shall be reported to the COR within five (5) days of the contractor becoming aware of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) Upon approval of the security clearances, the Contractor shall be given written confirmation from either the COR or the Contracting Officer that the individual(s) have been cleared to work at BEP.</p>
<p>(5) Contractor employees who have been cleared and are working onsite at BEP's facility will be subject to an annual criminal history check. The results of the annual criminal history check will be reviewed according to the same standards as the initial investigation conducted by the WCF Security Division. The annual criminal history checks will be utilized to identify potentially disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks identify disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks cannot be performed by BEP due to non-submission of the required information by Contractor employees.</p>
<p>(6) The contractor must provide a security package to the COR for any potential hires to replace an employee previously cleared to work at BEP. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that an interim access clearance has been approved and the potential employee can be employed on this contract. The employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable access determination for high risk positions, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that a final access clearance has been approved and the potential employee will be issued an identification badge and allowed access to previously restricted areas.</p>
<p>(7) Some of the work to be performed may require access to restricted data and classified National Security information, compartmentalized information, restricted physical areas, and classified systems. All individuals proposed to perform requirements involving such access must have the appropriate security clearances, as designated by the BEP, at the time that the specific tasking is initiated. These requirements will be identified on a case by case basis and discussed between the COR and Contracting Officer prior to the start of the assignment. The contractor must show how these requirements will be met and the depth of corporate resources available to respond to ongoing requirements.</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(end of clause)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2013) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

<p><br />&emsp;<br />Section M - Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability. Technical Capability - Technical capability will be evaluated based on the offeror's knowledge of the tasks and deliverables as stated in the performance work statement and RFP, as well as the offeror's capability for transforming its understanding into successful performance under the resultant contract; displaying an understanding of the tasks and deliverables in the performance work statement; describe familiarity working with HSPD-12(Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12) Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Badges; quality assurance surveillance plan to ensure that deliverables are met as demonstrated in the technical capability section of their submissions; and a transition plan (incoming and outgoing) that explains how the offeror will ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Management Approach - Management approach will be evaluated based upon offeror's knowledge and understanding of the requirements set forth in the performance work statement and RFP as it relates to organizing, staffing, and managing the tasks and deliverables; qualifications of key personnel (ie. project manager, team supervisor, and other relevant key positions) describing their experience in office administrative services in the management approach section of their submission.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Past Performance - The offeror should identify other federal government contracts, and should describe the past experience of their company in providing similar support services as specified in this solicitation within the past three (3) years. If contractor has not held 3 previous federal government contracts of this nature, may list state and local contracts, or comparable private experience. Provide a list of three (3) references pertaining to those contracts including the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's Name<br />&bull; Contract Number and Contract Type<br />&bull; Original Contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options)<br />&bull; Original and final completion date<br />&bull; A description of the contract effort<br />&bull; The relevance of this contract to the current procurement<br />Point of contact including telephone number</p>
<p>The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor <br />unfavorably.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Experience - Experience will be evaluated based on offeror submission of recent relevant experience with similar types of services/work. A description of accomplishments in relation to office administrative service efforts shall be verifiable and specific enough to show the scope and relevance of the projects.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Price -The Offeror's price will be evaluated including the total price of the base year, and four option years. The proposal will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation, as well as for price reasonableness.</p>
<p>The non-price factors of technical capability, management approach, past performance, and experience when combined are more important than price. <br />PURPOSE OF TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: The technical proposal will primarily determine the qualifications and capability of the offeror to participate in this contract. It should be specific and complete in every detail. The proposal should be concise and provide sufficient information to demonstrate the offeror's capacity to satisfactorily perform the task outlined in the solicitation. No price information shall be included in the technical proposal. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Evaluation Ratings<br />Each non-price criteria will be rated as follows:<br />1. Unacceptable ; proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies; fails to meet performance or capability standards; an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements</p>
<p>2. Marginal; Overall quality cannot be determined due to errors, omissions or deficiencies; only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal performance; high degree of risk in successfully meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>3. Good: Adequate quality; demonstrates good understanding of requirement and approach that meets performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed contain minor issues or concerns; moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>4. Outstanding ; Outstanding in all aspects; offers one or more significant advantages not offset by disadvantages; significantly exceeded performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed had very few minor issues or concerns; very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be rated as:</p>
<p>1. Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>2. Moderate Risk - Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>3. High Risk - Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>4. Unknown Risk - Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>6.2 SECURITY ACCESS GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES<br />6.2.1 Contractor and Subcontractor employees requiring access to the BEP shall be subject to a background investigation and favorable adjudication. They must also be "identity proofed" in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD 12). Personal identity verification will be performed before assignment to perform work under the contract. All positions under the contract will be assigned a "position sensitivity level." Position sensitivity levels range from HIGH RISK to LOW RISK. Position sensitivity levels are determined based on access to currency manufacturing areas and processes required by the position. The BEP COR will coordinate with the BEP Security Division to determine appropriate position sensitivity levels. <br />Upon contract award the Contractor shall furnish the BEP COR a list of persons under employment consideration, to include the full legal name, SSN, date, city, state and country of birth. BEP's Personnel Security Branch will establish an electronic profile of the individual within the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigative Processing system (hereinafter "e-QIP") and provide a packet with instructions and additional forms that must be returned to the BEP Personnel Security Branch. A postage paid envelope will be provided for return of the forms. <br />After all initial security processing has been completed the contract employee will be granted an exchange access badge and begin the process of PIV by providing certified copy of birth certificate, passport or Certificate of Citizenship (to prove citizenship status) and two (2) forms of identification as outlined in Form I 9 "List of acceptable documents." NOTE: One ID must be a Federal, State or Local government picture ID). Once completed the contract employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments pending completion of the background investigation and adjudication; however, the contract employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. Interim access may be granted after receipt of fingerprint results. Once favorably adjudicated the COR will be notified and the contract employee will be brought back in to complete the PIV process and receive a BEP picture badge with level of access to the area of contract work. If the contract employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable determination for level of access required, the Contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. <br />6.2.2 The Bureau reserves the right to deny access to its facilities and security systems, in accordance with adjudicative guidelines set forth in Executive Order 10450, its amendments, and any applicable supplemental directives (in particular, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 731), to any individual about whom an adverse suitability determination is made. Failure to submit the required security package or to truthfully answer all questions shall constitute grounds for denial of access clearance. The Contractor shall not provide access to employees, until the BEP Security Division, provides written access clearance through the COR. <br />6.2.3 The Contractor is responsible for reporting adverse information (i.e., arrests, bankruptcy, etc.) that may affect the employment suitability of their employees. This information shall be reported to the COR within five (5) days of the Contractor becoming aware of the situation. <br />6.2.4 Upon approval of the security access, the Contractor shall be given written confirmation from either the COR or the CO that the individual(s) have been cleared to work at BEP. <br />6.2.5 Contractor employees or subcontractor employees who have been cleared and are working on-site at BEP's facility will be subject to an annual criminal history check. The results of the annual criminal history check will be reviewed according to the same standards as the initial investigation conducted by the WCF Security Division. The annual criminal history checks will be utilized to identify potentially disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the Bureau's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks identify disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the Bureau's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks cannot be performed by BEP due to non-submission of the required information by Contractor employees.<br />6.2.6 The Contractor must provide the COR with names of potential new hires to replace an employee previously cleared to work at BEP with the full legal name, SSN, date, city, state and country of birth of each replacement hire. The COR or CO will notify the contractor in writing that an interim access clearance has been approved and the potential employee can be employed on this contract. The employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable access determination for the risk level requested, the Contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. The COR or CO will notify the Contractor in writing that a final access has been approved and the potential employee will be issued an identification badge and allowed access to previously restricted areas.</p>
<p>6.2.7 Some of the work to be performed may require access to restricted data and classified National Security information, compartmentalized information, restricted physical areas, and classified systems. All individuals proposed by the Contractor to perform requirements involving such access must have the appropriate security clearances, as designated by the BEP, at the time that the specific tasking is initiated. These requirements will be identified on a case by case basis and discussed between the COR, CO and BEP Personnel Security Manager prior to the start of the assignment. The Contractor must show how these requirements will be met and the depth of corporate resources available to respond to ongoing requirements.<br />6.2.8 The Contractor shall exercise due diligence in pre-screening all employees for employment suitability prior to submission to BEP for agency access clearance. The Government will provide, after contract award, an example of the types of questions the Contractor may ask in screening potential employees. The questions are derived from the questionnaire Contractor employees will be required to complete online for initiating their agency access clearance. BEP will initiate the agency access procedure upon contract award for all direct labor employees where BEP facility access is necessary for performance under the contract. If a proposed Contractor employee or subcontractor employee is denied an agency access clearance or if for any reason a proposed application is withdrawn during the agency access clearance process, the contract price shall be reduced by $1,500 for each additional Critical Sensitive or High Risk background investigation BEP must conduct, $1,000 for each additional Moderate Risk background investigation and $500 for each additional Low Risk background investigation BEP must conduct. This subparagraph does not apply to JWOD contractors or non-profit entities.<br />6.2.9 If during the performance of the contract, a Contractor or subcontractor employee is replaced, BEP shall initiate an agency access clearance investigation for any replacement. If BEP denies an agency access clearance to a Contractor or subcontractor employee proposed as a replacement, the contract price shall be reduced as described in paragraph 6.2.8 above.</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(end of clause)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2013) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

<p>Factor 4 - Experience - Experience will be evaluated based on offeror submission of recent relevant experience with similar types of services/work. A description of accomplishments in relation to office administrative service efforts shall be verifiable and specific enough to show the scope and relevance of the projects.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Price -The Offeror's price will be evaluated including the total price of the base year, and four option years. The proposal will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation, as well as for price reasonableness.</p>

It should be specific and complete in every detail. The proposal should be concise and provide sufficient information to demonstrate the offeror's capacity to satisfactorily perform the task outlined in the solicitation. No price information shall be included in the technical proposal. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Evaluation Ratings<br />Each non-price criteria will be rated as follows:<br />1. Unacceptable ; proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies; fails to meet performance or capability standards; an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements</p>
<p>2. Marginal; Overall quality cannot be determined due to errors, omissions or deficiencies; only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal performance; high degree of risk in successfully meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>3. Good: Adequate quality; demonstrates good understanding of requirement and approach that meets performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed contain minor issues or concerns; moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>4. Outstanding ; Outstanding in all aspects; offers one or more significant advantages not offset by disadvantages; significantly exceeded performance or capability standards; performance areas assessed had very few minor issues or concerns; very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>

<p>3. High Risk - Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>4. Unknown Risk - Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>H.2 Security Requirements</p>
<p>The contract requires Contractor/Sub-Contractor employees to work onsite at BEP's Western Currency Facility (WCF). Contractor employees are required to comply with all security procedures and follow instructions from Police and Security personnel. In the event conflicts arise between Police/Security instructions and the contract, Police/Security instructions will take precedence. Contractor employees experiencing conflicts with instructions must contact the COR immediately to resolve the conflict before performing work that would result in a contract change or incur additional costs for the government. While on Bureau properties contractor employees are subject to the same standards that govern Bureau employees conduct. Contractors are expected to know and follow Bureau facility visitor access and escort policies requirements at all times. A failure to follow security policies and instructions may result in a citation being issued for a security violation and/or access authorization being withdrawn. Security requirements for specific processes are identified below.</p>
<p>a. Employee Behavior. <br />(1) Conduct. Contract personnel shall not, at any time during the contract period, represent themselves as employees or agents of the U.S. Government. Contract personnel shall conduct themselves at all times in a proper, friendly, efficient, courteous, businesslike manner, and are subject to the same rules and regulations as BEP employees. See employee handbook "Conduct" section. <br />(2) Dress. Contract personnel shall dress uniformly so as to identify the person as an employee of that contract. If the contract calls for uniform to be worn the name of the Contractor shall be prominently displayed on the wearer. <br />(3) Drug Free Workplace. The Contractor shall be compliant with all aspects of a drug-free workplace as prescribed in FAR 52.223-6.<br />(4) Impaired Employee. Any Contractor employee or sub Contractor employee determined to be impaired by the supervisor or COR or otherwise unable to perform the full range of duties and responsibilities of their position shall be relieved from the work assignment and replaced. <br />b. Security<br />(1) Securing Facilities. The Contractor shall secure the Government facilities at any time the facility is not occupied to protect its contents and information. In the event a contract employee finds an area or facility under their control that is not secure they must notify the Police Command Center immediately. Failure to comply with facility security requirements may require the Government to conduct an investigation to determine if the facility and its contents to include information were compromised. The Contractor shall be responsible for the Government's labor cost of the investigator and investigator's assistants. The Government labor cost is calculated from the employee's basic pay, plus benefits and overhead. <br />(2) Denial of Employee Entry. The BEP may deny any person access to its facility that is identified as a threat or potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being, general order or operational mission of the BEP and/or the BEP's employees. This denial will not relieve the Contractor of its responsibilities under the terms and conditions of this contract.<br />(3) Badges. Contractor personnel shall retain a Government-issued access badge and shall present it upon request by any Government employee. The Contractor shall return access badges to the COR or designated representative upon Contract termination or termination of an employee. The badge will be worn in accordance with employee handbook "Access Badge" section.<br />(4) Breach of Security (Information Security). Contractor personnel taking any action that does not comply with the rules, regulations, or guidelines set forth in the BEP Security Manual, or leads to a breach of security, shall be considered a security violation. Neither the Contractor nor any of its employees shall disseminate, or disclose any information concerning the operations and activities of the WCF and its tenants, that could result in or increase the likelihood of a breach of the facility's perimeter, internal security, or interrupt the continuity of its operations. The Government reserves the right to seek from the Contractor costs incurred by the Government to mitigate damages resulting from any breach of security by Contractor personnel. <br />c. Security Access General Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Contractor and Subcontractor employees requiring access to the BEP be subject to a background investigation and favorable adjudication. They must also be "identity proofed" in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD 12). Personal identity verification will be performed before assignment to perform work under the contract. All positions under the contract will be assigned a "position sensitivity level." Position sensitivity levels range from HIGH RISK to LOW RISK. Position sensitivity levels are determined based on access to currency manufacturing areas and processes required by the position. The BEP COR will coordinate with the Security Division to determine appropriate position sensitivity levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the BEP COR a list of all persons under employment consideration, to include the full legal name, date, city, state and country of birth. The Security Division will establish an electronic profile of the individual within e-QIP (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigative Processing). Once the e-QIP profile has been established it must be accessed within 10 days. After the initial access of e-QIP, all online security forms must be completed within 14 days.</p>
<p>After all initial security processing has been completed employee will be granted an interim access determination and will be allowed to perform limited assignments pending completion of the background investigation and adjudication; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable determination for level of access required, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. Upon contract award the contractor's employees designated to provide services under this contract will be provided the following forms, considered a Security Package, for completion. The completed Security Package shall be submitted to the COR within 5 calendar days after contract award.</p>
<p>(a) Department of Treasury Form TD67.32.5, Authority for Release of Information.</p>
<p>(b) Optional Form 306, Declaration for Federal Employment.</p>
<p>(c) Form SF 85P - High Risk.</p>
<p>(d) Form SF 85P-S, Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(e) Form FD 258, Fingerprint Card (2).</p>
<p>(f) FCRA, Release Form, Credit Report.</p>
<p>(g) Police and Criminal History Release Form.</p>
<p>(2) The BEP reserves the right to deny access to its facilities and security systems, in accordance with adjudicative guidelines set forth in Executive Order 10450, its amendments, and any applicable supplemental directives (in particular, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 731), to any individual about whom an adverse suitability determination is made. Failure to submit the required security package or to truthfully answer all questions shall constitute grounds for denial of access clearance. The Contractor shall not provide access to employees, until the Security Division, provides written access clearance through the COR.</p>
<p>(3) BEP Contractors are responsible for reporting adverse information, i.e., arrests, that may affect the employment suitability of their employees. This information shall be reported to the COR within five (5) days of the contractor becoming aware of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) Upon approval of the security clearances, the Contractor shall be given written confirmation from either the COR or the Contracting Officer that the individual(s) have been cleared to work at BEP.</p>
<p>(5) Contractor employees who have been cleared and are working onsite at BEP's facility will be subject to an annual criminal history check. The results of the annual criminal history check will be reviewed according to the same standards as the initial investigation conducted by the WCF Security Division. The annual criminal history checks will be utilized to identify potentially disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks identify disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks cannot be performed by BEP due to non-submission of the required information by Contractor employees.</p>
<p>(6) The contractor must provide a security package to the COR for any potential hires to replace an employee previously cleared to work at BEP. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that an interim access clearance has been approved and the potential employee can be employed on this contract. The employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable access determination for high risk positions, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that a final access clearance has been approved and the potential employee will be issued an identification badge and allowed access to previously restricted areas.</p>
<p>(7) Some of the work to be performed may require access to restricted data and classified National Security information, compartmentalized information, restricted physical areas, and classified systems. All individuals proposed to perform requirements involving such access must have the appropriate security clearances, as designated by the BEP, at the time that the specific tasking is initiated. These requirements will be identified on a case by case basis and discussed between the COR and Contracting Officer prior to the start of the assignment. The contractor must show how these requirements will be met and the depth of corporate resources available to respond to ongoing requirements.</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(end of clause)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2013) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

<p>(2) The BEP reserves the right to deny access to its facilities and security systems, in accordance with adjudicative guidelines set forth in Executive Order 10450, its amendments, and any applicable supplemental directives (in particular, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 731), to any individual about whom an adverse suitability determination is made. Failure to submit the required security package or to truthfully answer all questions shall constitute grounds for denial of access clearance. The Contractor shall not provide access to employees, until the Security Division, provides written access clearance through the COR.</p>
<p>(3) BEP Contractors are responsible for reporting adverse information, i.e., arrests, that may affect the employment suitability of their employees. This information shall be reported to the COR within five (5) days of the contractor becoming aware of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) Upon approval of the security clearances, the Contractor shall be given written confirmation from either the COR or the Contracting Officer that the individual(s) have been cleared to work at BEP.</p>
<p>(5) Contractor employees who have been cleared and are working onsite at BEP's facility will be subject to an annual criminal history check. The results of the annual criminal history check will be reviewed according to the same standards as the initial investigation conducted by the WCF Security Division. The annual criminal history checks will be utilized to identify potentially disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks identify disqualifying suitability issues. Access to the BEP's product or premises will be withdrawn if annual criminal history checks cannot be performed by BEP due to non-submission of the required information by Contractor employees.</p>
<p>(6) The contractor must provide a security package to the COR for any potential hires to replace an employee previously cleared to work at BEP. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that an interim access clearance has been approved and the potential employee can be employed on this contract. The employee will be allowed to perform limited assignments; however, the employee must be escorted in all facility areas and will not be granted access to sensitive systems. If the employee does not meet the requirements for a favorable access determination for high risk positions, the contractor shall replace him/her at no additional cost to the Government. The COR or Contracting Officer will notify the contractor in writing that a final access clearance has been approved and the potential employee will be issued an identification badge and allowed access to previously restricted areas.</p>
<p>(7) Some of the work to be performed may require access to restricted data and classified National Security information, compartmentalized information, restricted physical areas, and classified systems. All individuals proposed to perform requirements involving such access must have the appropriate security clearances, as designated by the BEP, at the time that the specific tasking is initiated. These requirements will be identified on a case by case basis and discussed between the COR and Contracting Officer prior to the start of the assignment. The contractor must show how these requirements will be met and the depth of corporate resources available to respond to ongoing requirements.</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(end of clause)<br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2013) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?

Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

<DESC>This ammendment is to provide answers to questions and remove the requirement for the hotel to be outside a 1 mile radius of a casino.  <br>  <br>  <br> Change From: must not be located within 1 mile of a casino  <br>  <br> Change To: there is no restriction on the distance from a casino.  <br>  <br>  <br> Questions and Answers: <br>  <br> QUESTION: Will there be 4 different events in April - May or just one and the dates provided are alternate dates that can be used?  <br>  <br> ANSWER: There is only 1 event and those are available dates for the National Guard. We may include 28-30 Mar as a potential date as well.  <br>  <br> The National Guard is not available 11-13 Apr, 18-20 Apr, 9-11 May or 24-25 May. That makes the available dates for this one (1) event to be 4-6 Apr, 25-27 Apr, 2-4 May, 16-18 May and 28-30 May.  <br>  <br> If there are dates outside of the above, please send them directly to MAJ Travis for review and response. We do not want to go into March or June for this event as many of these attendees are required to attend this training during the proposed time frame. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> QUESTION: Are the numbers of participants listed in the statement of work, final numbers or do you anticipate a drop in numbers prior to the event?  <br>  <br> ANSWER: These numbers are estimated at this time and will be confirmed 30 days prior to the event.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> QUESTION: The SOW states that the contractor must be able to attend planning meetings for this event.  Can you please tell me how many planning meetings you anticipate having for this event? <br>  <br> ANSWER: We currently do not have any planning meetings scheduled but vendor will be required to attend if one is scheduled. Prior notification will be provided if the meeting is required. <br>  <br>  <br> QUESTION: The Solicitation calls for a venue with three ballrooms set up for 850 attendees simultaneously, is this really what you are looking for, or do you need a total of three separate places that could hold 850 people?  <br>  <br> ANSWER:  We in fact do need (1) ballroom for 850 for the whole weekend for awards set up, practice, and execution during the entire event.  We also need another ballroom (2) for 850 for general sessions, guest speakers, large training sessions for post deployment audience, and opening and closing ceremonies.  The final ballroom (3) can be smaller for 650 or we can combine general sessions and dining into the 2nd ballroom if they can keep the layout the same with no flipping of either ballrooms for the entire weekend.  If we reduce to 2 ballrooms, they must remain the same layout. <br>  <br>  <br> The response time has not changed and is still December 12th, 2013 by 10:00am CST.

The artwork and photos (all created/taken/paid for by the contractor) are to be high resolution, color items, and inserted electronically into the publication and follow the industry standards for printing and on-line publications.  <br>    <br>  B.	During the execution of the work, the Contractor will consult with the Public Outreach Team (PORT) team members to ensure the newsletter is consistent with the current message and theme (explained in paragraph C below)  and to obtain required information pertinent to writing stories and articles for the newsletters. This may include travel to other Corps District offices within the location of work.  The Rock Island District in Rock Island, IL is the most likely travel location but may include travel to a number of other Corps Districts. The newsletter will be comprised of several stories and articles, with creative and high quality graphics/photos, to be written and developed by the contractor based on the current message and theme of the OUR MISSISSIPPI newsletter, as described in paragraph C below. The template for the newsletter is to follow the past editions of OUR MISSISSIPPI newsletter and include similar design elements and cues to keep continuity for the reader. The consistent message, look, and feel are extremely important in the branding work that has been in place since 2008. The articles of the newsletter should be reflective of the Corps and Stakeholder needs and encompass a wide variety of activities relevant to the entire Mississippi River, including the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP), the Environment Management Plan (EMP), Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) Regulatory, Operations and Emergency actions of the Corps of Engineers, plus activities of partner and stakeholder organizations along the River from Minnesota thru Louisiana.   <br>    <br>  C.	Contractor is responsible for the initial development of an idea list and the research and writing of magazine quality text that is accessible and interesting to the general public, but also sophisticated enough for lawmakers and long-time river interests represented to have their needs met. Some story source names will be provided by the Corps, but most of the idea and article development relies on the contractor initiative, and a variety of sources representing collaboration will be expected for a given piece. Contractor is responsible for shooting and/or purchasing photography/art work and for securing high-resolution photography (if available) from the Corps or other relevant organizations/agencies. Stories should strive for a timely hook, when appropriate, but also be written in a way timeless enough to keep them relevant through the three-month period during which each issue is in circulation. The story mix must support a watershed-wide approach to river sustainability now championed by the Corps and its partners but also a format established with earlier issues that includes segments such as:  quote mark My Mississippi quote mark  personality profiles, and educational but fun and graphically interesting Kids  Page and multiple stories that connect to various Corps missions.   <br>    <br>  All story development and review will be agreed upon by the PORT team prior to start of work and final story development by the contractor. All development is to be consistent with the current Our Mississippi outreach program and the Corps of Engineers design standards.  Each newsletter is subject to reviews conducted by the COR and study team members. These reviews will further refine the draft articles and help shape the final newsletter. The Contractor will be present for all draft review teleconferences and will be responsible for making all required changes to the newsletter to create the next version. The review process is iterative and usually will require a minimum of three draft reviews and a maximum of five reviews. Changes and comments will be received in various forms from fax, email, on-line documentation, and verbal. The Contractor is responsible for making all changes and rewriting the articles based on study team comments. The Contractor will respond in writing to all written comments received. The Contractor is responsible for proper grammar usage and assuring there are no spelling errors in draft versions of the newsletters.  <br>    <br>  D.	The final draft of the newsletter will be approved by the COR in consultation with other   <br>  internal Corps study members. Once the newsletter is approved for printing, a high resolution PDF of the final document will be emailed to the COR for final approval. The COR will have one day to review, make changes, and approve proof copy. If mistakes are found in the proof that are significant errors/omissions, corrections will be required and a new proof copy delivered to the COR for final approval. Proof copies can be overnight delivered using any overnight service. The Contractor is responsible for the subsequent printing and distribution of 50,000 copies of the newsletter. The newsletter is to be printed on white, 80 lb., 14 quote mark x21 quote mark  recycled paper, using soy ink in full 6 color processing. Printing is a full bleed document. Printer plates are to be created at a minimum of 133 line screen resolution for maximum clarity. For mailing, the newsletter is to be folded in half, folded in half again, and tabbed on the center of the open end (same as shown on past newsletters).   <br>    <br>  E.	The distribution is to be done using the U.S. Post Office, third class bulk rate mail (the   <br>  piece does not qualify for bulk rate discounts). Two databases in Microsoft Excel will be provided by the COR prior to each mailing for the most current addresses. The list is currently at 50,000 addresses and is anticipated to grow 5% each quarter. The contractor is to plan to accommodate this growth rate for each quarterly distribution. The preferred mailing method utilizes ink jetting the addresses on the newsletters and presorting the newsletters before they are mailed to save the Government money. The newsletters must be post marked by the dates indicated in paragraph 4.A of this scope of work. The Contractor will also distribute bulk mailings to the other District and Division offices involved in the study. All extra copies of the newsletter are to be mailed to the COR.   <br>    <br>  F.	The final step in distribution of the newsletter is an electronic PDF version of the   <br>  newsletter for use on the Corps Internet Web Page. This needs to be delivered to the COR within 2 days after each final newsletter is submitted. Both a Hi-Rez and Low-Rez PDFs are required to be submitted.  <br>    <br>  3. Contract Pricing  <br>    <br>  A. The Contractor's pricing shall include all costs associated in the production of the newsletter and distribution. Including the cost of all data collection, writing, photos, artwork and editing of newsletter articles, travel, teleconferences, and associated costs to accomplish the work under the contract, except as may be otherwise specifically provided for in this contract.  <br>    <br>  4.

Distribution date for the newsletter is no later than 17 January 2014. Work will begin as soon as the contract is in place.

<DESC><strong>This amendment is to reflect the addition of NAICS Code 922160 - Fire Protection to&nbsp;question #20 in the PDF attachment. No other changes are being made to this RFI.</strong><br /><br /><br />1.0 Description
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force to facilitate decision making for potential future acquisitions. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Commodity Council (AFCECC) is seeking information on Personal Protective Equipment products and services in support of Air Force installations throughout Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside of Contiguous United States (OCONUS).</p>
<p>The AFCECC is part of the Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. The mission of the ESG is to provide the U.S. Air Force cross-functional installation strategic sourcing and acquisition solutions. The ESG is the Air Force's centralized organization for executing enterprise-wide strategic sourcing of goods and services for Air Force installations throughout the United States. They utilize strategic sourcing best practices to continually improve and re-evaluate organizational purchasing activities, to improve quality, and reduce costs for installation acquisition. The ESG uses cross-functional teams called "Commodity Councils" to strategically source goods and/or services at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>We are conducting market research into the personal protective equipment industry to better understand the capabilities of the supply base and obtain feedback on our projected personal protective equipment needs. The initial scope of this research includes 3 main categories and their respective items within:</p>
<p>Structural <br />- Helmet <br />- Hood<br />- Coat<br />- Gloves<br />- Pants<br />- Boots</p>
<p>Proximity <br />- Helmet <br />- Hood<br />- Coat<br />- Gloves<br />- Pants<br />- Boots</p>
<p>HazMat <br />- Chemical Vapor Protective Clothing Level "A" (NFPA 1991 compliant)<br />- Leak Test kit for Level "A" suits <br />- Chemical Splash Protective Clothing Level "B" (NFPA 1992/1994 compliant)<br />- Chemical-Resistant Gloves (per type)<br />- Disposable Foot Covers<br />- Chemical-Resistant Boots (per type)<br />- Cooling Vests<br />- Hard Hats<br />- Chin Straps<br />- Safety Glasses<br />- Safety Goggles<br />- Coveralls (Fire Retardant)<br />- Hearing protection for high level noise areas<br />- Personnel Decontamination Gowns<br />- Personnel Decontamination Clothing<br />- Personnel Decontamination Footwear<br />- Personnel Decontamination Towels<br />- Personnel Decontamination Blankets<br /><br />In addition, provide services that include inspection, maintenance, cleaning, and repair for CONUS and OCONUS Air Force Installations.</p>
<p>Currently, these products and services are typically procured, when needed, by each facility using a local base contracting office and GPC card holders. The AFCECC seeks to develop a long term strategic sourcing contract vehicle to satisfy demand so facilities may place orders as needs arise. By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, we will simplify the acquisition process and reduce the lead time in the ordering process for the requesting location. There has not been any final determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The AFCECC seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures for personal protective equipment throughout CONUS and OCONUS. As the AFCECC is analyzing the feasibility for an Air Force wide acquisition solution, preliminary research suggests that the scope might stretch the capabilities of small business. However, we seek both large and small business respondents who are interested in supporting the Air Force's needs. The input received will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors.</p>
<p>If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the questionnaire at <a href="http://www.mcix.com/fireppe">http://www.mcix.com/fireppe</a>. This will include providing the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information. We highly encourage all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough questionnaire in response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. Notice: The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, all of whom have signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.</p>
<p>The above link will direct you to the online questionnaire. For your convenience, there is a PDF document that has all the questions so you and your company can review prior to starting the online questionnaire. You will need to have information such as your company's DUNs number, CAGE code (if available), basic employee data, revenue data, etc. for the past 3 fiscal tax years (or as best approximated). The PDF document is for reference only. The online questionnaire will be the source tool for gathering responses, please use the best available information or estimates. If you need to stop the survey during any time, you will be able to resume your session using the same computer from which you started.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFCECC requirements. Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">www.fedbizopps.gov</a> for future announcements regarding future needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. The Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website can send automatic alerts when a notice is posted meeting established criteria. To subscribe to this service, vendors should establish a "search agent" within their registered account. Search agents can be established for any combination of criteria, be set to run at your desired frequency and will notify you of relevant opportunities. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the FBO site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>
<p>4.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>ESG CECC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to support Air Force market research by obtaining further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>5.0 Responses/Questions</p>
<p>Please complete the questionnaire no later 1 October 2012. Questions on this RFI may also be directed to these POCs listed below:</p>
<p><br />Mr. Joe Mamer <br />Contracting Specialist <br />771 ESS/EGA<br />joseph.mamer@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Mr. Brian Brown<br />Program Manager<br />771 ESS/EGA<br />brian.brown2@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>6.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. It is intended to identify sources that can provide information around capabilities for providing personal protective equipment needs.</p>
<p>The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. The Air Force has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong>Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.<br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.
<p>Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $10M and $15M. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Christina Fernandez.<br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong>Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by date of award, the PCO will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong>The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.</p>
<strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong>An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirement requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Fairchild Air Force Base may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the <br />independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br />Note: CH2M HILL Constructors, Inc (CH2M HILL) has recently completed conducting investigations and/or focused remedial design pilot testing at two Fairchild Air Force Base Environmental Restoration Program sites under USACE contract W91238-06-D-0013. The two sites represent a significant part of the Fairchild Air Force Base PBR. The following documents have been delivered in draft form and will be posted to the RFP key documents site:
<p>i. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB, Site SS-39 Pre-Design Investigations.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB Site SS-39 Injection Summary.</p>
<p>However, for site SD-37 (which is included in subject contract and this PBR), CH2M HILL delivered an initial draft technical memorandum that is not sufficient for the Air Force to post at this time. We intend to post some of the associated data attachments to the CH2M HILL Technical Memorandum, Fairchild Air Force Base, Site SD-37 Datagap Investigation and Analysis, however, without the full context of the associated technical memorandum, this presents a conflict of interest where CH2M HILL has access to site investigation not available to other Offerors.<br /><br />CH2M HILL recently completed conducting optimization of&nbsp;Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 remedy under contract FA4890-06-D-0007-0001. As part of that optimization, CH2M HILL built and operated site Soil Vapor Extraction and In-Situ Chemical Oxidation remedy optimization components. CH2M HILL representatives have stated they have all of the actual construction and operational cost data associated with the remedy optimization components readily available, but have not provided the information in their draft report of the optimization effort. This detailed information will be needed for the Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 Proposed Plan and Record of Decision Amendment preparation, which is a required task of the PBR. This information has not been provided in a format readily available to other Offerors and therefore, potential Offerors will have to re-create by estimating all of the associated parameters and costs. Based on this, CH2M Hill has a conflict of interest because they have information that is not readily available to other Offerors.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The synopsis is being amended to change the First Article units to Design Re-Qualification units and to increase the quantity to 8 units.&nbsp; This is due to a clarification in the range safety requirement that indicates&nbsp;if any item has been out of production for more than one year a&nbsp;re-qualification of the design shall be performed.&nbsp; Eight Re-Qualification units are being produced: 4 will be tested to a 60 day wet life test, and 4 will be tested to a 120 day wet life test.&nbsp; Additionally, 6 units are being taken from the Production&nbsp;Articles and re-named to Engineering units; these units will be built&nbsp;the same time as the re-qualification units.&nbsp; This is to allow for earlier delivery to meet customer requirements.&nbsp; The total units produced and delivered will be 48 units: 42 Production Article&nbsp;units and 6 Engineering units.&nbsp; The 8 Re-Qualification units will be built and consumed in testing.

The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />This notice is neither a request for quotes nor a solicitation of offers; however, all proposals received within&nbsp;fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed by the Government for future considerations. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement&nbsp;in the future will be in the best interest of the Government. Responses must provide clear and concise documentation indicating a vendor's bona fide capability to provide these services. Requests must include company name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers of the requester, e-mail address, Cage code and business size. All proposals should be delivered via e-mail to <a href="mailto:andrew.taylor@hill.af.mil">andrew.taylor@hill.af.mil</a>, no later than 2:00pm MST, 19 Dec, 2013.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING    <br>    PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR    <br>    PROPOSAL, OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE    <br>    RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSION OF    <br>    INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE    <br>    INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.    <br>    The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving    <br>    Ground, MD 21005, is conducting this RFI to identify potential sources for the development of EW capabilities as described below on behalf of Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence & Electronic Warfare & Surveillance (IEW&S), Program Manager (PM) Electronic Warfare (EW), PdM (CREW).    <br>        <br>    Description:    <br>    Requirements have been identified to provide continued system growth and conduct research,development, testing and evaluation (RDT &E) of new capabilities for enhanced force protection against emerging Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) threats. Currently, a RDT &E effortknown as Duke Technology Insertion (DTI) is being conducted with the Army Duke system under contract W15P7T-09-D-M615 with SRCTec Inc, 5801 East Taft Road, North Syracuse, NY. The Duke system provides force protection against RCIED threats for occupants in wheeled and tracked vehicle    <br>    platforms and within vicinity of fixed site positions. This RDT&E requirement is to continue threat and technique development to maintain relevancy and responsiveness to urgent needs as required. This effort is intended to also include integration of the Duke system with other electronic warfare systems (e.g, direction finding, HMS radios, JTRS, TACSAT 117G/F, etc.).    <br>    System threshold and objective level performance parameters are identified within a Capabilities Production Document (CPD). These parameters can be provided to interested industry parties at a classified level. It is desired that the initial tested capability meets objective level requirements within the CPD. The system, however, must meet threshold performance parameters and be ready for testing in 3 rd    <br>    Quarter of 2015. It is anticipated that DTI systems and the Duke system Technical Data Package (TDP)will be provided to the successful offeror upon award of a contract that could result from any future Request For Proposal (RFP) of the DTI effort.    <br>    The Government requests that interested parties submit white papers that fully describe their system capabilities with respect to the classified performance levels in as much detail as possible. Based on the white paper submission, the Government may elect to conduct a one-on-one discussion based on its analysis of the RFI response, to include the quality of submission and level and scope of the information    <br>    provided. This may include visit to contractor facilities to assess firsthand the validity of described capabilities and, if needed, its demonstration. Any capability and demonstration must be available for government assessment no later than 15 January 2014.    <br>    Those capabilities that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government lab on Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.

<DESC><p>The overall objective of the Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program is to enable and accelerate the development of promising diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for certain diseases within the purview of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). In that context, the NHLBI has identified two "opportunity gaps" in the early stages of the development process by which new medical research is translated into new medical products. The first gap occurs between the conceptualization of potential medical advances and the experimental validation of those concepts as medical product candidates (designated as the "Concept to Proof-of-Principle" stage or Stage-A). The second gap resides between the demonstration of proof of principle and the completion of studies required for the assessment of a product candidate in human clinical trials (designated as the "Proof-of-Principle to IND/IDE" stage or Stage-B).</p>
<p>The term "product candidate", as it concerns the VITA Program, is also used to refer to new diagnostics, new therapeutic interventions (agents or devices), or novel applications of existing therapeutic interventions. The product candidate(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, devices, diagnostic tests, imaging probes, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents. The VITA Program will provide support for early-stage translational development of product candidates in the fields of vascular disorders, thrombotic diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. Proposed project areas of interest may include peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>This solicitation will seek proposals for two (2) different study stages e.g. concept to proof of principle (POP) [Stage-A] and proof of principle to investigational new drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) [Stage-B]. Up to six (6) contracts (with up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-A awards and up to three (3) contracts (with up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-B awards. A total of $5.8M is available for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) round. A BAA is not eligible for any small business set-aside program.</p>
<p>Companion to this BAA solicitation, is a request for proposals (RFP) solicitation for a Program Coordinating Center (PCC) to award a single contract to provide project management, meeting coordination, and regulatory advice for the awarded BAA contractors that require such services. The RFP solicitation for the VITA PCC is synopsized in a separate solicitation notice (RFP-NHLBI-CSB-HV-2013-04-JS). Interested Offerors are highly encouraged to locate and review the companion solicitation. Contract proposals for the BAA and the RFP solicitations will be due in late August 2012. Awards are planned for August 2013.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The solicited requirement will cover 36 months and Cost-Reimbursement-Completion type contracts with options pricing are being considered. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the project's goals and the available funding.. It is the Offerors' responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS for any amendments to the BAA. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a contract to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center for NIDA Intramural Research Program (IRP) Clinical Research Program support without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).
<p><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 with a Size Standard of $14 Million.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05- 70 dated September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The mission of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the NIDA is to conduct state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie drug abuse and addiction, and to develop new methods for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. Research is supported at the molecular, genetic, cellular, animal, and clinical levels and is conceptually integrated, highly innovative, and focused on major problems in the field. The long-term goal of the research is to better understand the biological and behavioral factors contributing to initiation, maintenance, and elimination of drug abuse and addiction (and associated diseases), and to translate this knowledge into improved strategies for preventing, treating, and reducing the negative consequences for the individual and for society caused by drug abuse and addiction.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The NIDA requires continued assistance in the ongoing operations of its clinical care support services and provision of resources necessary to maintain the research operation of the NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is December 13, 2013 through May 12, 2014. A&nbsp;time and materials&nbsp;contract type is contemplated. <br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>The requirement consists of continued Clinical Research Program support services and resources necessary to maintain the research program as follows:</p>
<p>1. Infrastructure<br />2. Medical Consultation<br />3. Diagnostic Laboratory and Other Testing Services<br />4. Nursing Services<br />5. Domiciliary Oversight and Care<br />6. Research Administration<br />7. Transportation and Supplies<br />8. Pharmacy Support</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, this is a follow-on requirement and the intended contract award will serve to continue current services while the Clinical Research Program Support requirement is re-competed. There are no other vendors in the current marketplace who can provide the level of support presently being performed by the incumbent contractor in this interim period. The incumbent contractor, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, has been providing these services since 2008. The required support is mission critical and must not lapse during the clinical research program support re-competition. It is anticipated that the new competition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis. An award is anticipated prior to May 12, 2014.</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center<br />4940 Eastern Avenue<br />Baltimore, MD 21224-2780</p>

SECTION II STATEMENT OF WORK
1. Project Description
The National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is responsible for conducting studies of the exposure of environmental stressors on ecosystem and human health.  Landscape ecology is an interdisciplinary science framework that studies the relationship between spatial patterns of landscape characteristics and conditions of and risks to ecological resources, including forests, rangelands, wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, and urban environmental settings. Local, regional, national, and global economies depend upon both goods and services resulting from ecological resources. Forests provide materials for many different types of paper products; agricultural systems provide food for the world population; coastal waters provide an abundant food resource; wetlands, streams, and rivers provide numerous recreational opportunities. An ecosystem, or landscape, approach provides a comprehensive basis for identifying and evaluating current and historical land use practices. In this study  we are focusing on riparian function which is heavily influenced by the condition of adjacent and upland ecosystems. Analyzing spatial relationships and short- and long-term trends can determine if goals and objectives are being met. It will also determine what changes are needed in moving the ecosystem towards the desired condition and developing future management alternatives.
Disturbance occurring within a watershed or adjacent to a stream corridor typically produces a causal effect, which may permanently alter one or more characteristics of a stream?s function, which depends on vegetation composition, soils and geomorphology and hydrology. Disruption of the natural water cycle will lead to hydrologic alterations such as increased volume and velocity of runoff, frequency of severity of flooding, chemical concentrations, decreases in natural runoff storage capacity in vegetation, wetlands and soil, and reduced groundwater discharge. 
The hydrologic, physical and ecological alterations resulting from terrestrial activity can have a pronounced impact to the natural function of a stream, lake and wetland. Water quality and biological communities are affected if a streams function is impaired. A stream?s shape evolves over time in response to flow and sediment loads. Increased volume and intensity of runoff leads to stream bank erosion resulting in streams becoming straighter, wider and shallower, reducing pool habitat and fish cover, and destroying riparian vegetation.
As a part of this effort, the Environmental Sciences Division is developing specific approaches to  assessing ecological function using Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), State and Tribal Water Quality and Biological Data. 
2. Description of Student Services:
The student will work within a multi-disciplinary research team and will provide technical ecological, Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing support for research projects characterizing the exposure of environmental stressors on riparian systems 
Specific duties will include assisting research staff in (1) Conducting field surveys including monitoring and recording of physical parameters and biological observations on riparian areas; (2) Photographic analysis; (3) Satellite imagery analysis; and (4) Geographic information system (Landscape metric generation) analysis and other duties necessary to carry out the studies.
The student contractor shall perform duties, as requested, according to specifications and instructions provided by the mentor. Where appropriate, the student contractor shall maintain careful and accurate records in designated laboratory notebooks.  These notebooks and all other data produced under this order will be the property of the Environmental Protection Agency.  All necessary instructions and training will be provided by the EPA mentor. As indicated in the Statement of Work, the student contractor may be expected to participate in conferences and seminars.   
3.  Required Expertise, Skills, Education and/or Experience:  
The student needs to have completed two years of college in biology, ecology, environmental science, zoology or a related field.  The preferred student will have training and/or experience in general Geographic Information Systems techniques, environmental studies, or Remote Sensing. The student will need to know basic field study safety requirements and will be given additional safety training at the Environmental Sciences Division.
4. Required Background Investigation and Suitability Determination:
 Student contractors awarded a contract will have to undergo a background investigation, a check of FBI fingerprint files, and a suitability determination by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Upon receipt of the contract award, go immediately to link http://cdx.epa.gov/warning.asp and register with the Central Data Exchange (CDX) and complete the iBoard application.  Notify the Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) as soon as this process is completed. The student contractor must review and complete the requirements before beginning work on-site at the EPA.  If a background check reveals information to indicate the student contractor represents a risk to the interests of EPA and the national security, the contract may be terminated.

<DESC><p>Program Support Services for the Office of Civil Rights</p>
<p>The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for Program Support services for the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). OCR, a staff division of HHS, ensures that people have equal access to and the opportunity to participate in and receive services from all HHS-funded programs without facing unlawful discrimination, and that the privacy and security of their health information is protected. In doing so, OCR helps carry out HHS' overall mission of improving the health and well-being of all people affected by its many programs and promotes integrity in the use of federal funds by removing discriminatory barriers to HHS funded services and programs. OCR annually resolves more than 10,000 citizen complaints alleging discrimination or a health information privacy or security violation.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Oracle Product License Agreement 

This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S.  Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
VA seeks to identify offerors who are authorized resellers of Oracle Maintenance support and products as identifed in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Attachment A.  
Interested parties submitting a Capabilities Statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate the ability to meet the stated requirements for an enterprise wide procurement of this magnitude.  The Capabilities Statement should clearly present evidence that the interested party is fully capable of providing the required Oracle licenses, maintenance and Oracle certified core support services and as such may include any information that the interested party feels is relevant.  Prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to submit questions and comments as soon as they are identified.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. 
As part of the response, please provide the following information:
1.	Status as a reseller of maintenance and software for all software titles identified in Attachment A.

2.	Describe value added capabilities that allow VA to achieve cost reductions in an efficient manner.  Discuss where these services have been applied in the federal Government in the past with positive results.  Please identify contract and Government POC information as applicable. 

3.	Describe how the vendor will provide VA support to manage the distribution and accounting for Oracle products procured and deployed throughout VA under this effort. 

4.	Provide estimated maintenance cost per fiscal year for each product with quantities shown in Attachment A.  For database and WebLogic related products, provide cost in ranges for each.

5.	VA seeks to avoid large balloon payments in any year of the contract, preferring relatively flat payments to accommodate budgeting issues.  Oracle ULA's commonly have large base year payments that VA cannot accommodate and VA seeks relatively equal annual payments across the base and option years of the contract.  VA does NOT seek a financing arrangement and must preserve the capability to not exercise annual options without incurring costs that are relatively equal to the cost of all remaining options.  Please provide a description of how this can be accomplished and sample language the Government can use in a solicitation to achieve this.

6.	Please provide comments to the draft PWS in the following format:

PWS paragraph #	PWS requirement	Suggested change	Rationale for change or comment

Submit  responses and  related information via email to Kimberly Flynn, Contract Specialist, at Kimberly.flynn1@va.gov no later than close of business December 12, 2013.  Please limit responses  to no more than 10 pages.  All proprietary/company confidential material shall be clearly marked on every page that contains such.  White papers should also include a short summary of your company's business/developments in this area and current deployments with references.  Also, please submit the name, phone number, and email address of the lead from your organization. 

VA reserves the right to not respond to any or all emails or materials submitted.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  

This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-It is executed on behalf of Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 16,  Michael E. DeBakey Medical Center to:

Extended Aftercare, Inc.
5002 N. Shepherd 
Houston, TX 77018
713-695-8403
Mr. Steve Boon, COO
Purchase Order # C40168

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
The Michael E. DeBakey Medical Center proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition services for homeless veterans in need of transitional housing and rehabilitative services with same vendor, Extended Aftercare, Inc. for the period of December 1, 2013 through February 28, 2014 until such time as a long term competitive contract can be solicited and awarded.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

Through the Michael E. DeBakey HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The work to be performed is substance abuse residential treatment services for homeless veterans to include 25 male and 5 female veterans for a two month period.  The total estimated value of the acquisition is $198,300.00.  Extended Aftercare, Inc. is the current contractor who can provide emergency transitional housing, substance abuse treatment, case management, life skills development, and transportation to homeless Veterans suffering from mental illness (MI), substance use disorders (SUD), and/or physical disabilities.   Contractor shall offer a safe, secure, and therapeutic environment that supports Veterans' rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities. 
Homeless Veterans served shall include:
1.	Male veterans with MI, SUD, and/or physical disabilities.
2.	Female veterans with MI, SUD, and/or physical disabilities with or without dependent children. 
3.	Residential treatment for male veterans with co-occurring disorders (MI and SUD).

The Contractor may provide services and accommodations to either 25 men or 5 women or both as long as those services provide safety and appropriate protection of the individuals.  Contractor shall ensure appropriate safety precautions are in place to reduce the risk of harm, especially with regard to women and children.   

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The specific paragraph must be cited.  Most likely, only the -1 or -2 authorities will be cited.  Please be aware that failure to adequately plan for future requirements does not constitute appropriate use of the unusual and compelling urgency statutory authority.

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 
The statutory authority cited is FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency, is necessary as delay in award of this contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government as this is for the continued residential treatment of 25 homeless male veterans and 5 female homeless veterans diagnosed with comorbid medical, mental health and substance abuse who are presently receiving services.  
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A competitive solicitation will be posted the the Federal Business Opportunities website in December 2013 as a small business set aside.  8 contractors were identified through market research that may be capable of providing the services. It is anticipated that adequate competition will be achieved in this procurement .

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  No change in price from previously awarded contract is anticipated.  Urgency of requirement limits the ability of the CO to adequately analyze the costs associated with this requirement. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  No market research was conducted for this emergency acquisition due the urgent and compelling need.  Current contractor is in place and has the resources necessary to maintain continuity of care during the solicitation phase.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Extended After Care, Inc.  (Incumbent Contractor)

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  A competitive solicitation will be posted the the Federal Business Opportunities website in December 2013 as a small business set aside.  8 contractors were identified through market research that may be capable of providing the services. It is anticipated that adequate competition will be achieved in this procurement ..

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
