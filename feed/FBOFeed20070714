<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division is seeking to award a sole source contract for research to develop and validate a decision-making algorithm for vaccination provision for adolescents in short-stay juvenile justice facilities. The Government has determined that George Mason University (GMU) is the only responsible source to meet the Government's needs. GMU has a unique ongoing relationship with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which will allow for the recruitment of the proper facilities to conduct the research. The proposed research is designed to assess the feasibility of developing and validating a decision-making algorithm for vaccination provision of adolescents in juvenile detention facilities based on self-reports from young people.  Contractor will develop a short questionnaire to be administered to adolescents as well as decision-making algorithm for use in analyzing responses to the questionnaire for the purpose of identifying adolescents in need of vaccination.  The questionnaire and algorithm will be tested in 3-5 juvenile detention facilities from diverse geographic locations. Total period of performance will be one year from date of award. The Government intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on 31 July 2007, with award by 31 August 2007. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to obtain the services of experienced, licensed Psychiatrists, who are Board Certified, or in the absence of Board Certification, have SSA Disability Program Experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts (ME) to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or psychiatric or psychological impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalists, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or psychiatric/psychological specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 

SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for an 8-month base period, with four 12-month option periods.   SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about July 18, 2007, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release.   Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.

This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS FOR RESPONSE BY SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR LESS.

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to conduct ongoing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effectiveness and safety of obstetrical clinical trials, and provide the products of such reviews for posting on the NICHD website. Furthermore, it is expected that the respondents publish, update, and disseminate the review products to the scientific community on a periodic basis, and provide methodological and technical support to the reviewers on an ongoing basis. 

The mission of the Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch (PPB), within the Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine (CDBPM), NICHD, is to improve the health of mothers and children with a focus on maternal health, pregnancy, fetal well being, labor and delivery, and the developing child.  One of the PPB areas of emphasis is to support the educational needs of obstetric health care providers.  Toward this end, the PPB seeks to solicit the conduction of high-quality systematic reviews on obstetrical topics for publication on the NICHD website.  

Background
In the mid 1980s, scientists from several countries developed processes for systematically developing evidence-based summaries on clinical therapies. By the early 1990s, a non-profit entity, The Cochrane Collaboration (CC) was formed in United Kingdom, which began a process of systematically updating clinical trials in many fields of medicine. The CC also established an ongoing Library of such reviews.  

The Pregnancy and Childbirth Collaborative group Cochrane reviews have been an invaluable resource to Obstetrician-Gynecologists by providing the most comprehensive and timely review of clinical obstetrical topics. The Cochrane Collaboration is an internationally renowned group of scientists that has systematically evaluated the evidence for health care practices since 1992. These reviews are highly structured and systematic, with evidence included or excluded on the basis of explicit quality criteria, to minimize bias. Data are often combined statistically (with meta-analysis) to increase the power of the findings of numerous studies, each too small to produce reliable results individually. It is estimated that so far the group has completed 350 reviews, and will continue to provide new and updated reviews annually. Since 1995, the NICHD has funded the Neonatal Cochrane Review Group (NCRG) through a contract mechanism and the reviews provided under this contract are posted on the NICHD website. According to NICHD Information Technology the NCRG review site is the most frequently visited NICHD site by the general public

This proposed initiative is to solicit proposals from scientists to provide the NICHD with obstetric reviews similar to those by the NCRG that meet the standards of Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. In addition, the respondents will be required to develop means of dissemination of reviews to the scientific community and to provide continued support to the scientists conducting such reviews.

To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate: 
1.	A record of having contact with and utilizing a defined group of eminent obstetricians/maternal-fetal medicine specialists and related scientists to perform systematic reviews/meta-analyses of obstetric therapeutic interventions. 

2.	A record of establishing a process of conducting such reviews on a continuing basis and  providing 10 new reviews and 15 review-updates each year related to topics in obstetrics.

3.	Methodological expertise and experience conducting systematic reviews, using guidelines from established, high-quality professional groups.

4.	Possession of experience and technical expertise sufficient to provide editorial, methodological, and technical support to the reviewers, and to regional editors of the reviews, if such editors are needed. 

5.	Proven capacity to maintain a database of primary reports/overviews of obstetric randomized controlled trials; to code and sort randomized controlled trials by topic, reviewer, and editor; and to update the database and classify the trials on a regular basis (monthly electronic search/quarterly hand search with classification and sorting every 3 months)

6.	Ability to update a classified bibliography of primary reports of obstetric randomized trials and overviews every 3 months.

7.	Experience and proficiency in maintaining an ongoing assessment of the review and trial monitoring systems, measuring up to the standard developed and maintained by high-quality professional groups, such as the Cochrane Collaboration. 

8.	Ability to provide the review results to NICHD every 4 months in an electronic format that will be compatible for posting on NICHD website. 

9.	Resources to organize annual meetings of the review group, prepare a newsletter, and an annual review 

10.	Ability to provide NICHD and the project officer with a copy of the aggregate database and specialized review results on an annual basis.

Interested SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit two(2) hard copies of their capability statement, addressing the areas above. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by no later than 4:00 PM local time on July 31, 2007. Capability statements must identify the small business status of the organization. NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Respondents may submit their capability statements via E-mail in addition to the 2 hard copies.
