<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is not a small business set-aside. Therefore, any responsible source may submit a quote.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Therefore, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number M67400-16-T-0081 applies and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
