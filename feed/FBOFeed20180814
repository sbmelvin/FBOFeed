<p>The 120mm M31 Fin is used on all 120mm mortar cartridges (High Explosive (HE), Illumination, Smoke, and Full Range Practice). The fin is assembled to the rear of the mortar cartridge to stabilize and orient the cartridge. The M31 Fin is an eight bladed two piece (fin and tube) fin assembly approximately 9.25 inches long and 4.75 inches in diameter at the blades. The fin blade component is machined from an extrusion of 2024-T8511 aluminum and Ultrasonically Tested for mechanical integrity properties. The tube is machined from an extrusion of 2024-T3511 aluminum. The M31 Fin assembly is anodized (Finish 7.2.1 of MIL-STD-171). The center is hollow to allow insertion of an ignition cartridge. Gas and flame are vented from the ignition cartridge though flash holes drilled in the tube section of the fin assembly. The performance of the fin is critical to the flight characteristics of the mortar cartridge.</p>
<p>The proposed contract strategy for the 120mm M31 Fin will be a competitive Total Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.203, which limits competition of the procurement to small businesses within the United States. The United States Government (USG) intends to award up to two (2) Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to include five (5) one-year ordering periods. The anticipated combined maximum ordering quantity for contracts awarded is 1,934,295, to be delivered at a rate of up to 25,000 per month per contractor. The estimated maximum contract value will be $92,000,000 with a guaranteed minimum of $100,000. Each Delivery Order will be competed amongst contractors selected for award.</p>
<p>The M31 Fin will be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged and delivered in accordance with the Government Technical Data Packages (TDP) and applicable contract requirements, which will be available upon solicitation release. This requirement involves technical data marked "Distribution D - Distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DoD contractors only." Interested firms are required to submit a signed and completed Military Critical Technical Data Agreement DD Form 2345), AMSTA-AR Form 1350, Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) for Government's consideration to provide access to the TDP.</p>
<p>Please note, this announcement is issued for notification purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. All interested small businesses are advised to monitor FedBizOpps (FBO) for RFP release. It is expected that the solicitation for this effort will be posted in or around September 2018, with an award anticipated for March 2019. Point of contact for this requirement is Mr. Mark Bobitka, ACC-NJ-CA, Bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email: mark.t.bobitka.civ@mail.mil Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>

<CONTACT>Salas-Waldo, Anna
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source contract and is not a request for competitive proposal. The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 6.301-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), New Mexico State Office, intends to award a sole source firm fixed priced purchase order to: New Mexico Department of Agriculture (NMDA), 3190 S. Espina, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88003. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 115310; the business size standard is $7.5.

The BLM manages 245 million acres of public lands primarily in the Western United States, including Alaska.  Seventy nine (79) million of these acres are infested with noxious and invasive weeds. One of the BLM's highest priorities is to promote ecosystem health and one of the greatest obstacles to achieving this goal is the rapid expansion of invasive brush species across public lands. Additionally, reclamation is critical once mineral resources have been fully extracted or are no longer needed from a particular location to prevent further expansion of invasive species and/or noxious weeds.

The BLM wishes to continue an on-going successful effort in multi-agency collaboration in Southeastern New Mexico utilizing a new contract for managing invasive brush species and implementing reclamation activities within the Pecos District.  The NMDA is currently a partner in the Restore New Mexico program and is familiar with the scope and type of restoration activities requested. NMDA is the "only entity with extensive, ongoing knowledge."

Competition is not available for this requirement because the Good Neighbor Authority authorizes the Bureau of Land Management to enter into agreements or contracts with state government agencies (see 16 USC 2113a) to perform Authorized Restoration Services. These services include those requested (invasive brush treatment and reclamation activities) to improve rangeland, watershed health, and wildlife habitat.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal and no solicitation document exits for the requirement.

<p>NIST's Material Measurement Laboratory's Materials Measurement Science Division (MMSD) conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement Techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic and biomolecular systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or monolayer/multilayer films.</p>
<p>In order to meet mission requirements, the MMSD has a need for an Automated Microscopy System Camera upgrade to an existing automated slide scanner system originally purchased under SB1341-15-SU-0951. The Automated Microscopy components are an upgrade to a materials screening and microdissection platform used in the development of an automated materials isolation platform. The upgrade is being made to the camera module: PCO-TECH pco.edge 4.2 M. The upgrade to a pco.dimax CS4 will allow for high speed, stroboscopic imaging. To maintain and improve the interoperability of the current system with the new system, NIST requires a 100% compatible upgrade for the existing system in terms of electromechanical coupling, computer control, and automatic module detection (plug-and-play). To achieve the necessary compatibility, a direct upgrade from PCO-TECH is required.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the following: PCO-TECH has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to the technology used in the upgrade. The upgrade must be hardware and software (PCO-TECH, SDK kit V1.23_01; PCO-TECH Matlab Toolkit V1.08; and PCO-TECH Camware 4.05_01) compatible with the existing equipment. The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to PCO-TECH. PCO-TECH is the sole US distributor of these upgrades.</p>
<p>Market research, found that no third-party vendors capable of meeting the requirement.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334310 with a size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 10:00 AM ET on August 27, 2018, will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: Pre-Solicitation<br />Response Date: 08/27/2018 10:00 am Eastern<br />Archiving Policy: Automatic, 15 days after response due date<br />Base Notice: Notice of NIST's Intent to Negotiate on Sole Source Basis for Software Synopsys Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) 3-year license<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Synopsys, Inc., located at 690 E Middlefield Rd., Mountain View, CA. 94043-4010 (https://www.synopsys.com/) to purchase 3-year software license for Synopsys Atomistix ToolKit.<br /><br />The mission of NIST's, Materials Science and Engineering Division (MSED), Thermodynamics and Kinetics Group (TKG) is to resolve the outstanding challenges in material property prediction as well as search for new materials with technological applications or for way to optimize the utilization of currently known materials. The goal is to develop measurement science and data that prove of significant value to industry. Among the phenomena investigated, one that is of relevancy to industry is the understanding of transport properties of nanoelectronic devises as a function of material, structure, phase, degree of contamination and so on.
<p>In order to understand the magnetic and electrons transport properties of topological insulators MSED needs to perform transport property calculations. TKG utilizes one software tool, the QuantumWise Atomistic ToolKit (ATK) to assist in calculating the data. The software model transports properties (I-V curves, conductance, contact resistance, spin current, transistor characteristics, tunnel magneto-resistance) using density Functional Theory and Tight-Binding computational approaches. NIST currently owns two licenses for this software; however, these licenses must be upgraded and maintained annually, as new capabilities, speed ups etc. are continually introduced in the software. Keeping up with new software developments is necessary for NIST to maintain its world-leading position in understanding and discovering and developing new, technologically important, materials, as well as in guiding the designing and interpretation of experiments in nanoelectronic, that could provide industry with state-of-the-art information.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that this is the only software compatible with the already developed bank of scripts and codes to set up ballistic transport simulations, run them, harvest and process the data. The upgraded software must be compatible with the current, already own version of the QuantumWise Atomistic ToolKit (ATK) software so that all the scripts and processing codes we have developed over the years can continue to be used. Synopsys, Inc. is the sole vendor of the software package QuantumATK.</p>
<p>Market research, found that no third-party vendors capable of meeting the requirement.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 511210 with a size standard of 38.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E128, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p><strong>Description <br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis services to identify, pull, aliquot, ship and test samples as for two (2) studies as described below from DKFZ, German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be two (2) years from date of award. <br /><br />It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute, and the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) conducts the following studies:</p>
<p><strong>Study 1.</strong><br />Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of cervical cancer, as well as subsets of cancers at other anatomic sites, including the oropharynx, vulva/vagina, penis, and anus. NCI reported that HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present in prediagnostic samples for 35 to 50% of oropharyngeal cancer cases, as well as some anogenital cancers. The increased risk of oropharyngeal cancer among HPV16 E6 seropositive participants was independent of time between blood collection and diagnosis and was observed more than 10 years before diagnosis. Further, this uniquely specific biomarker is consistently present in ~0.5% of controls from nested case-control studies. NCI's recent PLCO nested case-control study assessed the biomarker in 924 controls and 5 were positive. This represents the totality of the knowledge on the natural history of the biomarker in cancer-free men-the group at highest risk of HPV-driven OPC and thus the presumed population in which screening could potentially occur. NCI now aims to continue to expand its evaluation of HPV16 E6 serology in healthy individuals. This will be done in 2 phases.</p>
<p><strong>Study 2.<br /></strong>Gastric cancer is the 2nd most common cancer in men and the 4th in women in developing countries. The striking geographical variation in gastric cancer incidence and mortality, as well as the significant changes in rates over time and among migrants, suggest a strong role for environmental and life style factors in its pathogenesis. Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection and cigarette smoking have been identified as risk factors associated with higher risk of gastric cancer while higher intake of fruits and vegetables and the use of refrigerators have shown an inverse association with gastric cancer risk. In spite of H. Pylori infection decline in many developing countries, the prevalence and burden of gastric cancer (GC), is still high in these areas. The Golestan Cohort Study (GCS) has recruited a total of 50,045 people aged 40-75 from January 2004 to June 2008 in a high-incidence area and has followed them up since then. So far, through January 2018, a total number of 319 GC cases have been diagnosed among the cohort participants, after a median follow-up of 10 years. NCI is going to use the available data and biospecimens from this study for the analysis of risk factors and correlates of gastric cancer. This will be done in 2 phases.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the procurement for both studies is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Study 1</strong>.<br />German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) shall contract with Moffit directly to pull, aliquot (including blinded replicates), package and ship serum samples from the HIM study stored at the Moffitt Cancer Center to Heidelberg, Germany. This will be done in two phases; the first phase shall test a full series of samples; the second optional phase shall use results generated in phase 1 to sample and select for a second round of testing. <br />German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) shall perform HPV testing of these serology samples sent from Moffit from a subset of men in the HPV in Males (HIM) cohort study. This will also be done in 2 phases.</p>
<p><strong>Study 2.</strong><br />German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) shall contract with World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) directly to pull, aliquot (including blinded replicates), package and ship serum samples from the GCS study stored at the IARC Repository in Lyon, France, to Heidelberg, Germany. <br />German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) shall perform H. Pylori multiplex serology on all case and control and duplicate samples selected by NCI (a total of 1700 samples). This includes 42 H. pylori proteins which have been bacterially expressed and GST tagged.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS/ AND PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS </strong></p>
<p><strong>Study 1.</strong><br />In phase 1, Contractor shall request Moffit to select, pull, aliquot and ship 4200 serum samples from participants in the HIM cohort to the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) for HPV serologic analysis using the ELISA assay.</p>
<p><strong>Optional Task - Phase 2.</strong> Contractor shall use the HPV serology results generated in phase 1 and other test results to identify, pull, aliquot and ship a second batch of 350 HIM serum samples to DKFZ for HPV serologic testing using both the ELISA and Luminex assays. <br /><br />In both phases, the Contractor is responsible for contracting with Moffitt Cancer Center to ship samples directly to DFKZ. Once HPV serology results are received from both rounds of serologic analyses, HIM study data from Moffitt Cancer Center shall be merged with HPV serology test results from DKFZ to create a master analytic file (including covariates such as, but not limited to, age, SES, geographic location, smoking history, sexual behavior, and others). This anonymized Masterfile shall be shared between NCI, DKFZ and Moffitt investigators.</p>
<p><strong>Study 2.</strong><br />In phase 1, Contractor shall request IARC to select, pull, aliquot and ship 1700 serum samples from participants in the GCS to the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) for H. Pylori multiplex serology. These samples include 319 gastric cancer cases diagnosed during the cohort follow-up, a 4 to 1 incidence-density matched set of controls (n=1276) stratified by major confounders, and 105 duplicate samples for quality control.</p>
<p>In phase 2, DKFZ shall perform multiplex serology to measure H. Pylori antigens in the plasma from 1700 samples shipped to them, and deliver all results, and detailed data from the serology assays to NCI as a report and EXCEL spreadsheets. The information obtained under this procurement will be used to determine the relationship between different risk factors and the risk of gastric cancer development.<br /><br /><strong>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>DKFZ is the only known lab that runs a Luminex-based serologic assay for the necessary HPV genotypes and proteins as well as Multiplex serology testing, which is a high-throughput method for detection of antibodies to up to 100 different antigens in large serological studies. The assays have been developed and perfected by DKFZ. To the best of NCI's knowledge, there is no other lab with the expertise to conduct the wide range of serology tests required in this procurement. In addition, this lab possesses the capacity necessary to test these samples within the time period of this procurement.&nbsp; Also, this is a continuation of previously studies conducted by DKFZ. Any alterations to the results will result on waste of Federal funding and time. Thus, NCI plans to make an award to DKFZ.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM EST, on August 21, 2018. All responses and questions can be emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) through sam.gov. Reference: N02CP82641-57 on all correspondence.</p>

<p><br />Tri Tool, Inc. is the prime integrator on the V-22 Aircraft and is the designer, developer and manufacturer (Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)) of the current Tube Cutting Set. An adequate purchase description or other information suitable for this effort has not been developed because the Government does not have sufficient engineering data nor does the Government own the technical data. The specific information on the self-contained set of tools and accessories resides with the OEM; therefore, the Government does not own the drawings to make available. The Government intends to procure the above under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The intent of this notice is to provide the pre-award synopsis for the Maintenance and Repair Multiple Award Construction Contracts primarily at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina and surrounding areas. 

The work includes, but is not limited to, a diverse range of general maintenance and repair construction services for small work requirements of a one-time nature, typically issued to correct or repair situations including, but not limited to, structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical, civil, grounds, road, pavement work, communication systems, new construction, demolition flooring, painting etc.

Offerors shall submit with their offer a bid bond of $3,000,000/ 20% of the amount for Davis Bacon Act (DBA) work.

SELECTION CRITERIA: 

Firms responding to this synopsis will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firms to perform the required services in accordance with the published selection criteria.  Failure to comply with instructions, or provide complete information may affect the firms evaluation or disqualify the firm from further consideration.  The following selection criteria, in descending order of importance, will be used to evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms:

Criterion 1 - Firms Specialized Experience: 

Firms will be evaluated for specialized experience in relevant projects that involved the execution of fire protection and life safety studies and surveys, performing final inspection and testing of fire protection systems, and water flow testing.
 Project submission demonstrating more variety in the types of fire protection systems experienced and types of facilities located in the NAVFAC Pacific areas of responsibility (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, Tinian, Diego Garcia, Australia and other Pacific Ocean areas) will be more favorably considered.

The types of fire protection system may include, but is not limited to, various hydraulically designed sprinkler and standpipe systems, interior fire alarm systems, fire detection systems including very early smoke detection systems and optical fire detection systems, mass notification systems, exterior fire alarm reporting systems, firefighting access and water supply systems, fire pump systems, fire protection water storage systems, foam systems, gaseous fire extinguishing systems, dry chemical systems, wet chemical systems, smoke management/control systems, fire modeling, fire compartmentalization, fire stopping, fireproofing, etc.
 Submission of specialized project experience having more variety in the types of fire protection systems and projects location in the NAVFAC Pacific areas of responsibility (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, Tinian, Diego Garcia, Australia and other Pacific Ocean areas) will be more favorably considered.  Projects shall be completed within the past ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice. 

Submission requirements: 

SF330, Part I, Section F:  Provide a maximum of five (5) projects demonstrating specialized experience in relevant projects.  Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.
 If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will only evaluate projects up to the maximum number authorized in the order submitted.

All projects provided in the SF330 must be completed by the actual office/branch/regional office/individual team member proposed to manage and perform work under this contract. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part 1, Section F, block 25, Firm Name. Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21. Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).
In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. 

The submission should include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the offerors specialized experience. For projects performed as a subcontractor or a joint venture involving different partners, specifically indicate the value of the work performed as a subcontractor or by those firms proposed for this contract, and identify the specific roles and responsibilities performed as a subcontractor or by those firms on the project rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.
 If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects may be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) relevant projects.
