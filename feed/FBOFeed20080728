The general activities involved in this effort include planning, fieldwork, analysis, and report preparation. Secondary objectives include the technical editing and desk top publishing of documents, compiling of inventory data, records maintenance, and site file and site atlas updating in BLM field offices.  As target areas are identified for a particular type of management action, BLM will evaluate the need for specific types of inventory or other tasks to be performed.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Cincinnati, Ohio, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Brigham and Women's Hospital, for: Occupational Exposures in the Nurses Health Study III - Pilot Project Phase II.
<p>Background and Need<br />Over 2.5 million nurses are employed in the U.S., 95% of whom are female. Female nurses are exposed to a wide variety of known and potential reproductive hazards including chemical and biological agents, physical demands, and shift work. Preliminary results from our ongoing collaboration between NIOSH and the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS-II) team showed that spontaneous abortion was associated with night work, long working hours, and reported exposure to sterilizing agents, antineoplastic agents, and x-rays; and that preterm birth was associated with reported exposure to sterilizing agents and prolonged standing. We now have the opportunity to build on our collaboration with the NHS-II team by participating in the NHS-III, a new groundbreaking study, with improved study design, including prospectively-collected data, in-depth questions on occupational exposures, and access to non-occupational covariate data and biological samples.</p>
<p>Eligible participants will be female Registered Nurses or Licensed Practical / Vocational Nurses between the ages of 22-42. Potential participants will be mailed a letter of invitation, which has been previously approved by NIOSH, from the study principal investigator. NIOSH investigators will collaborate with the NHS-III team to develop modules to assess shift work, long working hours, physical factors, and occupational chemical exposure. Data will be collected via a web-based baseline questionnaire and pregnancy questionnaires. In addition to occupational exposures, data will also be collected for smoking, caffeine, and alcohol consumption, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, prior spontaneous abortion, parity, medical conditions, and medication use. Data will be collected, stored, and analyzed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with oversight from NIOSH investigators. Letters of invitation for the first phase of the pilot study have been mailed to 12,000 women. We had anticipated that approximately 1200 (10%) would have enrolled. However, only 120 enrolled in the first phase of the pilot study (1%), which is unacceptable. Therefore, we would like to conduct a second phase of the pilot study to try to increase the participation rate to 10%.</p>
<p>Project Objective<br />The overall objective of this study is to contribute towards a pilot study of a new longitudinal, occupational cohort of female nurses of reproductive age, the Nurses' Health Study III (NHS-III). In this study, we propose to collaborate with the NHS-III team on a second phase of a pilot study, including the redesign of occupational questions into a paper questionnaire that is suitable for direct electronic scanning, recruitment of nurses, data collection, and data analysis and evaluation. The proposed study would be adapted from the web-based version used in the first pilot study phase. The NHS-III is modeled after the highly successful Nurses' Health Studies. In the first pilot phase, web-based questionnaires were tested among an initial group of 120 nurses.</p>
<p>The second phase of the pilot study will differ in several ways. The first strategy (the "viral" strategy) will be to ask current participants of NHS and NHS-II to contact younger colleagues and invite them to participate in the new cohort. A group of 500 current participants will be sent emails asking them to forward the email message with the invitation to participate to colleagues who may be interested in participating. In addition, the invitation materials should also give the option of horizontal transmission (i.e. nurses invited by current NHS participants will be asked invite other nurses who might be interested in participating).</p>
<p>The second strategy will be to send a 4-page paper baseline questionnaire along with the invitation letter. Participants will be given the option of returning the paper questionnaire or completing the same questionnaire on-line. The idea is to use the paper questionnaire to gain credibility and then switch over to internet as many participants as possible.</p>
<p>The NHS-III study team is also investigating the possibility of offering continued education (CE) credits as an incentive to complete the questionnaire. An on-line education program for nursing has been contacted to help recruit nurses for the study, as well as provide free CE credits to NHS-III participants.</p>
<p>In addition, phone calls will be made to non-responders in an attempt to convert them to responders.</p>
<p>The following specific aims are proposed: <br />Specific Aim 1: To redesign occupational question modules for the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires for a paper questionnaire formatted for direct electronic data scanning.<br />Specific Aim 2: To obtain names and addresses of 6,000 nurses for mailing of invitations for the second phase of the pilot study.<br />Specific Aim 3: To develop invitations for the "viral" method to be sent by e-mail to existing NHS and NHS-II participants.<br />Specific Aim 4: To assess the feasibility of the study by conducting and evaluating a second pilot phase.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />The NHS-III pilot study phase II will assess whether participation would be maximized by offering a mailed questionnaire. It will also investigate the "viral" method of enrollment.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />Sub-Task A. To redesign occupational question modules for the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires in scanable, paper format. <br />The purpose of this sub-task is to redesign occupational exposure modules from the existing web-based baseline and pregnancy questionnaires for a format that will be on paper and will have the ability to be scanned electronically (Specific Aim 1). Occupational exposures and activities on the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires shall include work schedule, night work, and average hours worked per week over the previous year. There are also two lifetime shift work questions. Data shall also be collected on physical factors, such as lifting at work and hours spent standing or walking at work, on average, over the previous year. Separate exposure modules shall be developed to collect information on lifetime occupational chemical exposures to anti-viral and antineoplastic medication administration, high-level disinfectants, and anesthetic gases. The occupational exposure modules shall also collect information on exposure controls, such as ventilation and use of personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Sub-Task B: To obtain names and addresses of 6,000 nurses for mailing of invitations for the second phase of the pilot study.<br />This sub-task will require the contractor to obtain names and addresses of 6,000 eligible nurses for inclusion in the mailing of invitations that include paper questionnaires (specific aim 2). The contractor shall work with the mailing house to ensure that the mailings take place in a professional and timely manner. The mailings shall also include a return postage-paid envelope and a copy of frequently asked questions. In addition, a "warning" postcard shall be mailed to all potential participants indicating that a letter will be arriving in a week.</p>
<p>Sub-task C: To develop invitations for the "viral" method to be sent by e-mail to existing NHS and NHS-II participants. <br />This sub-task will involve recruitment of participants through the "viral method" (specific aim 3). This method will be to ask current participants of NHS and NHS-II to contact younger colleagues and invite them to participate in the new cohort. A group of 500 current participants will be sent emails asking them to forward the email message with the invitation to participate to colleagues who may be interested in participating. In addition, the invitation materials should also give the option of horizontal transmission (i.e. nurses invited by current NHS participants will be asked invite other nurses who might be interested in participating).</p>
<p>Sub-task D: To evaluate the pilot study phase II.<br />Before conducting the full cohort study and to make improvements to the study design, questionnaires, or recruitment strategies, the contractor shall evaluate the pilot phase (Specific Aim 4). We conservatively estimate that 10% of those invited to participate will respond, based on the response rate to the NHS-II. However, the pilot study efforts to date have only produced a 1% participation rate. If the actual response rate remains to be less than 10%, NIOSH will collaborate with the contractor to evaluate whether the full study is feasible. The contractor shall provide summary statistics to NIOSH of key variables from the baseline and pregnancy questionnaires, including occupational variables, demographic variables, and other health outcomes. The summaries shall include frequency statistics for categorical variables and means and range of continuous variables, as well as the percent missing data. The accuracy and completeness of data and feasibility of data analysis shall also be evaluated by the contractor, with input from NIOSH investigators. The contractor shall evaluate whether mailed questionnaires improve participation, and by how much.</p>
<p>Personnel Requirements<br />Contract staff should include an epidemiologist, a computer programmer / statistician, and a web-programmer. The epidemiologist should have experience in reproductive epidemiology, epidemiology methods, and statistical analysis, and should have familiarity with the methods of the Nurses' Health Studies. The computer programmer /statistician should have experience with the Nurses' Health Studies data and be familiar with using SAS. The web-programmer associated with the NHS-III is necessary to the contract to facilitate programming the occupational modules and redesigning the questionnaire into a shorter, paper format that is suitable for direct electronic scanning.</p>
<p>Reporting Schedule<br />The contractor shall submit monthly progress reports and budget updates. These reports shall include information on enrollment, demographic information on participants, and progress of data analyses, when applicable. In addition, the contractor shall communicate regularly (via bi-weekly conference calls) with the NIOSH technical monitor to resolve problems and discuss progress. The estimated period of performance is 13 months after award of contract.<br />References:<br />The following references may be helpful:<br />Information on the Nurses' Health Studies: http://www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs/ <br />The following publication resulted from our ongoing collaboration with the Nurses' Health Study II: <br />Work schedule during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.Whelan EA, Lawson CC, Grajewski B, Hibert EN, Spiegelman D, Rich-Edwards JW.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of an Easat Antennas Ltd. model EA6501 antenna fitted with the Easat anti-icing modification which will allow the continued use of the radar system in severe cold weather environments.  The antenna fitted with the anti-icing modification will be accompanied by a hollow-shaft slip ring assembly, a new pedestal mounting assembly, a pedestal motor/gearbox cold weather modification kit, and any necessary waveguide components necessary for operation of the modified antenna, pedestal and gearbox.  These items are critical to enhance the availability and reliability required in FAA ASDE-X surface radar systems.  The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a one-time option to buy additional antennas and associated hardware following technical approval.
The Easat antenna is a proprietary design.  Easat Antennas Ltd. owns the specifications and drawings.  The associated electrical, electronic, and waveguide hardware must operate with the Easat antenna.  The FAA does not have technical specifications or drawings for the EA6501 antenna.  Due to existing problems with ice accumulation and shedding, and with interruption of radar service due to failures associated with increased rotational torque, these modifications must be deployed as soon as possible.  
Vendors must respond directly to the contracting officer identified.  Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements and have access to OEM data called out in this market survey must respond with their documentation in writing to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt at connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.
Responses shall be received by 3:00 p.m. CST, August 15, 2008.  Late responses may not be considered.  
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire this equipment.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<CONTACT>Lisa A Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0346, Fax 301-480-3432, Email lh314r@nih.gov - Allison M Stang, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-0359, Fax 301-480-3432, Email stanga@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a non-competitive acquisition with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) for the NIDCR "Salivary Gland Tumor Biorepository," pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is a five-year requirement to coordinate and establish a centralized biorepository that stores and catalogues salivary gland biospecimens through a network of satellite centers with proven expertise in salivary gland tumors.  The biorepository will, in turn, distribute bio-specimens and data after the requests have been reviewed by the appropriate governing bodies.  This will be facilitated through an interactive database that is accessible via a Web browser and is searchable online.  MDACC will perform the following services:  (1) acquire and collect new biospecimens from MDACC and satellite centers consisting of fresh frozen tissues and paraffin blocks, with matched serum, saliva, and lymphocytes (if applicable), as well as clinical data; (2) establish and store cell lines derived from tissue specimens; (3) develop and maintain a comprehensive, computerized, and secure database housed at MDACC, which will provide detailed information of each biospecimen/cell line, and provide a web-based electronic interface that enables access to available information on biospecimens/cell lines; (4) establish access policies for biospecimen and cell line requests and disbursement to research community; and (5) recruit additional satellite centers.</p>
<p>MDACC is currently providing these services under a supplement to an existing Head and Neck SPORE grant awarded to Dr. Scott Lippmann (P50CA097007), co-funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and NIDCR.  However, it is not optimal for the Government to continue to support the biorepository under this grant, and thus NIDCR intends to continue to support this effort through a contract mechanism.  Transfer of this work described above to any other contractor would result in substantial cost duplications and unacceptable delays in accomplishing the Government's goals for the study.  It is therefore recommended that this acquisition be negotiated on a non-competitive basis with the existing site, MDACC.  The period of performance shall be five years, beginning July 1, 2009 with an estimated completion date of June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>MDACC is renowned for the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with salivary gland tumors, and has a long-standing interest in the biological and molecular investigations of these tumors.  MDACC has the largest collection of salivary gland tumor specimens in a single institution in the nation.  Since 2000, MDACC has collected 1,050 archival specimens with 526 matched fresh frozen and paraffin embedded tissues.  MDACC has been identified as the national and international authority in the pathology and classifications of salivary gland tumors.  MDACC has authored the World Health Organization classification of mucoepidermoid and adenoid cystic carcinoma.</p>
<p>This is not a request for a competitive quotation.  However, if an interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must demonstrate the ability to provide the same repository materials and distribution center, as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services, as described above.  All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIDCR to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Statements of capability must be received at the following address (or email of word document acceptable) no later than 4:00 pm local time, September 11, 2008:  National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Rockledge II - Room 6102, 6701 Rockledge Drive - MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902 (use 20817 for express mail), Attention: Lisa A.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Responses providing insufficient information will not be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.</p>

<DESC><p>This procurement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in La Jolla, CA require a contractor to captain sailling vessel to record marine mammal acoustic data as part of Vaquita Expedition. The period of performance will be from date of award to 12/31/2008. Interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov) . This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Vaquita, the Gulf of California harbor porpoise, is the most endangered species of marine<br />mammal. There is strong interest in monitoring the fate of vaquita but both acoustic and visual<br />methods used in the past are not sufficiently precise now that abundance is down to around 150<br />individuals. Two new methods are being tested and calibrated with the earlier methods:<br />autonomous acoustic bottom mounted devices and towed acoustic surveys using a sailboat.<br />The research will use three research vessels, the Koipai Yu-Xd (MX), the RIV David Starr<br />Jordan (DSJ, NOAA, USA), and a chartered Corsair 24 trimaran.<br />II. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of the 2008 Vaquita Expedition is to develop arid test new methods for acoustic<br />monitoring of vaquita in the Northern Gulf of California. One of the components of the 2008<br />Vaquita Expedition is the Corsair Project, which would detect vaquita vocalizations using a<br />passive hydrophone array towed behind a sailing vessel (Corsair).<br />III. CONTRACT TASKS<br />A. Tasks<br />The sailing vessel to be used on Vaquita Expedition 2008 will be one 24' Corsair trimaran which<br />will be chartered from a US Company. As Captain of the Vaquita Expedition 2008 sailing vessel,<br />you would be responsible for:<br />1) Operating the vessel when underway;<br />2) The safety of all passengers;<br />3) Monitoring of weather prior to departure and throughout the day<br />4) Launching and docking the vessel as needed;<br />5) Assisting the acoustician to guard the safety of towed acoustic gear;<br />6) Learning Corsair handling from owners as needed;<br />7) Training three (3) acousticians in safe handling of the Corsair;<br />8) Maintaining communication with the other research vessels;<br />9) Ability to communicate with Mexican vessels in case of emergency; 10) Basic<br />maintenance including<br />- maintenance of the outboard and refueling<br />- basic maintenance of the ships' hull, rigging, sails, and accessories<br />- basic maintenance of the ships' electronics, excluding scientific equipment</p>
<p>10) Anchoring of the vessel when needed<br />Scientific operations aboard the sailing vessel are expected to last up to eight (8) hours daily plus<br />transit time which could be up to six additional hours. Scientific operations are expected to take<br />place seven days a week, including holidays. The Charter Company has three owners, all of<br />which plan to be Captain during some portion of the Expedition. When a co-owner and the<br />contracted Captain are both aboard, vessel responsibilities need to be determined prior to sail.<br />The period of time Captain Services will be needed is 15 September through 26 November,<br />2008. The sailing schedule will be highly dependent on weather. A working schedule will be six<br />days of sailing followed by one day of rest. If weather prevents sailing, the calendar will be reset<br />and the six days of sailing will start count anew with the first sail day after the weather day.<br />Further, two 4-day rest periods will be provided during the study period; the timing of the rest<br />periods will be dependent on weather and require approval by Chief Scientist.<br />The Corsair project is experimental in nature and will require a flexible design that adapts to<br />what works both in the wind conditions and also with vaquita, which are known to avoid boat<br />engine noise. The number of people aboard will be as few as two (the Captain and one<br />acoustician) and as many as five (additional acousticians during periods of development).<br />Through the water speeds must be kept at less than 8 knots and as constant as possible, which<br />will require considerable sailing skill. Because this is such a small operation, it is expected that<br />the Captain and acoustician will work together to minimize fatigue, which will likely mean using<br />the acoustician to do some boat driving/sailing. Because the Corsair is a specialized sailing craft,<br />the Captain will.be responsible for training in safe use of the boat by the acoustician. Similarly,<br />the Captain and acoustician will be expected to share duties needed for multi-night outings such as provisioning the boat with water, food and fuel and making of meals.<br />The vessel is relatively new and simple, and should only require minimal maintenance. The<br />captain's expertise is required for basic maintenance and to identify repair needs. Costs for<br />materials associated with repairs will be covered by the owner(s); however, it is expected that the<br />captain will perfonn all basic repairs. These will be addressed on a situational basis, and based<br />on recommendations of the captain.<br />The vessel is small and lightweight, and considerable importance should be placed on safety. The<br />captain will be expected to monitor weather conditions, prior to departure, and throughout the<br />day.

The experience, skill set, and timeliness in response required for installation, maintenance, and repair of the related systems rests solely with the Lockheed Martin Corporation engineering staff.  This is a follow on to Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N66604-06-G-0942 with Lockheed Martin Corporation.  Each years quantity for the services is estimated to be 40,727 hours per year.    This solicitation will be unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541330; size standard is $4.5 Million.  The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 8/12/2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>AATD anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, Fiber Optics Risk Reduction Program.  The program will test the design and integration of unique optical harnesses with active conversion circuitry within connectors for electrical to optical conversion for use on aviation platforms.<BR><BR>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command intends to award a Firm Fixed Priced contract to test the design and integration of unique optical harnesses with active conversion circuitry within connectors for electrical to optical conversion for use on aviation platforms. The optical harnesses will require no change to existing aircraft systems and will be compliant with current military aviation connectors as well as the same form factor as current military aviation connectors.  The program effort will include functional compliance testing on existing/upgraded optical cabling harnesses and will culminate in prototype fabrication and functional, environmental and electromagnetic testing of an optical cable harness that will be able to replace existing electrical cable harnesses on rotorcraft platforms.  Testing will be done by AATD to ascertain the ability of the harnesses to work in a rotorcraft environment.  This effort will satisfy the Armys requirement for a Technology Risk Reduction Program that decreases weight, saves space and improves reliability on the platform.  This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. FAR 6.302-1 provides for sole source awards when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and that no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Market research has identified DPG as the only source with the technology, expertise and relevant, demonstrated experience in applying this expertise to enable an Army-conducted test of these unique optical harnesses and their integration and performance on existing Army rotorcraft platforms as DPG holds Patent No. US 7,362,936 B2 Optical Harness Assembly and Method.  On the basis of the available data, AATD deems that only DPG is capable of providing the fiber optic cables and connectors such that the Army can conduct testing within the required timeframe. AATD does not envision conduct of a development activity, rather testing for Army use of prototypes incorporating unique technology, the subject of the aforementioned patent.  No other known source has the equivalent technical maturity to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe required.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Defense Photonics Group, Inc., 111 Corporate Blvd., Suite A, South Plainfield, NJ  07080.  The contract terms and conditions will be developed jointly between AATD and Defense Photonics Group, Inc.  The overall period of performance for the contract is twelve (12) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  This notice is not a request for proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by AATD.  Proposals submitted in response to this notice are due no later than September 12, 2008, 1:00 p.m. EST.  Proposals shall be submitted to the AATD, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Velvet Taylor), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.

Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.)  Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 70.0% to small business concerns; 6.2% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 7.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 9.8% for HUBZONE concerns; and 0.9% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,500,000. Responses to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree (B.Eng) from an accredited institution in Civil Engineering is desired at a minimum, Masters Degree (MSCE) preferred.
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbents actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric Turbulance &amp; Diffusion Division (ATDD) Oak Ridge, TN., intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Stevens Water Monitoring Systems Inc. for 400. Stevens Hydra Probes, Part Number 93640-025, Digital Hydra Probe II, complete with 25 ft. cable. The Hydra Probe II was approved by the Scientific Panel in 2006 to be added to the US Climate Reference Network's (CRN) instrumentation to measure soil moisture and temperature. At the time a comparison was made of existing instrumentation (Theta Delta_T Device PR2/6 Delta_Device, Campbello Scientific's Water Content Reflectometer and Hydra Probe II). It was the only probe that measured soil temperatures well as moisture. The Hydra II probe is the same sensor used in the US Department of Agriculture Soil Climate and Analysis Network (SCAN). For compatibility with soil observations from other national networks and because the Hydra II is the only known sensor that measures both soil moisture and soil temperature, this is the only known sensor that meets the government's requirements. This probe has undergone extensive testing and evaluation by the USCRN Scientific Panel. To change any instrumentation would require extensive testing and evaluation. The Hydra II probe instrumentation is the approved component of the USCRN Network, and any changes would require a repeat of these tests, plus one year evaluation. This probe is SDI-12 compatible which means that smart electronics on the probe does the computations, and the probe is queried for its data. The Hydra Probe has been determined to have lower uncertainties, the additional ability to measure soil temperature, and the compatibility with the current USCRN hardware.
<p>The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified below:</p>
<p>The ability to provide all-in-one system to measure simultaneously soil moisture variables and temperature. Probe must be compatible with the USDA network already in place. Probe must allow multiple sensors to be connected to a SDI-12 datalogger via a single cable. Must measure dielectric constant from 1 to 78 with an accuracy of + or -1.5%. Measure temperature from -10C to +65C with an accuracy of .1C. Operate on 9-20 VDC with a power requirement of 30mA when active. Include a cable. of at least 25 feet.</p>
<p>To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, shall include the brand name manufacturer. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information along with descriptive literature concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this supply previously and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this supply.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT  CLOSING SERVICES


The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking sources capable of providing closing services for Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) conservation easements. The applicable NAICS code is 541191.  Closing services will be for easements located throughout the State of Tennessee. Respondents may submit an offer to perform work in any or all counties in Tennessee. 

NRCS envisions entering into multiple Blanket Purchase Arrangements (BPA) with qualified vendors capable of providing closing services.  A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs.  It is not a contract.  The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE  It is anticipated that the BPAs will be utilized over the next several years to fulfill NRCSs title service needs.  The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party. 

SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED - The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) authorizes the acquisition of easement rights for willing landowners for the purpose of restoring and protecting wetlands. NRCS is the lead agency within the United States Department of Agriculture charged with administering the program.  The vendors awarded a BPA, will perform closing services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the United States Attorney General, in accordance with the attached specifications.  The vendor will basically provide the same closing services as in a commercial transaction, including obtaining deeds, and any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable insurable title in the name of the United States of America to the wetland easement.  Under current program regulations, the closing services do not include disbursement of funds to the seller.  The closing services will be performed in the county in which the wetland easement is located, unless the Vendor and landowner mutually agree to a different location.

<CONTACT>Michael V. DeAngelis, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9543, Fax 410-966-1261, Email Mike.DeAngelis@ssa.gov
<DESC>Overview
SSA is looking for an expert contractor with experience in scheduling cases in a judicial environment.  We are interested in an Automated Scheduling tool that may be of value to any part of the SSAs Intelligent Disability effort, whether its a front-end solution, back-end solution, or combination of both. Please provide enough documentation as to how you would address the needs described below to permit an initial assessment.
Background
The Social Security Administration is the nation's primary income security agency. It is responsible for administering the nations federal retirement, survivors, and disability insurance programs, as well as the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program for the aged, blind and disabled.

Historically, much of SSA's work relied on paper documents and manual processes. In 2003, SSA began transitioning its work from a manual processes to electronic in order to increase efficiency, decrease costs, and comply with the E-Government initiative, which requires elimination of redundant systems and improvement in customer service.
The Intelligent Disability (iDib) effort supports the goal of positioning SSA to deliver high-quality, citizen-centered service while making the right decision as early as possible. Intelligent Disability consists of a number of initiatives that directly support this goal. One of the initiatives currently in progress in support of SSAs objective to reduce the backlog is the automation of scheduling hearings, hearing sites, and associated hearing participants, both internal and external to SSA. When the functionality of Automated Scheduling solution is integrated into the electronic process, it will save SSA many work years and enable the agency to cope with its growing workloads.

ODAR, through its 145 hearing offices and remotes sites, is responsible for reviewing applications of claimants who have filed a Request for Hearing on an appeal of the prior level SSA benefits decision. It is ODAR's job to review the relevant documents, conduct hearings, and decide if benefits should be awarded. ODAR employs an overwhelming manual process to schedule its hearings. In fiscal year 2007 ODAR scheduled 567,864 hearings, including approximately 40,000 video hearings. In the current process the scheduler must manually coordinate the calendars and availability of multiple hearing participants, including the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), claimant, representative and experts, as well as the hearing site(s). The scheduler must rotate expert witnesses and simultaneously ensure to the extent possible that the experts, and in some cases the ALJs, have a full docket.  The scheduler must also coordinate and schedule the hearing site(s). The requirements for a hearing site may very depending on the type of the site. The scheduled site can be a Hearing Office, a permanent remote SSA-owned site, or a temporary site. The scheduling of the site may also depend on whether the site has video-hearing capability. The requirement for the software solutions is more than a calendaring system.  It is complex scheduling software that must satisfy ODARs business requirements in this area and integrate with existing SSA systems.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform as the CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) for the construction of the new United States Courthouse located in San Diego, California.  The Court's current facilities in San Diego do not meet their operational needs and requires additional space to accommodate their 10 year requirements through the year 2012.  The new Federal Courthouse facility will sit on a 2.6 acre, downtown San Diego site, bounded by Broadway Street to the north and State Street to the west.  Union Street will bound the project site to the east and E Street to the south, and both will be completely closed to vehicular traffic.  The project design architect is Richard Meir & Partners Architects LLP, and their design and construction documents have been completed and distributed to GSA as of April 2008.  The new facility encompasses approximately 467,000 gross square feet of space, which includes 98 non-public, underground parking spaces and is programmed to include 14 Courtrooms with an initial build out of 21 Chambers.  The estimated construction cost range is estimated to be between $300 - $328 million.

GSA plans to issue a Best Value Request for Proposal (RFP) which will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The selection procedure will employ tradeoffs where technical/management factors are significantly more important than price and price related factors.  Following the issuance and evaluation of the RFP, GSA intends to award a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) contract consisting of Pre-Construction Phase Services with an exercisable owner Option for the actual construction.  The current GSA project schedule assumes a pre-construction phase award of October 2008 with a construction start of February 2009.  The project construction duration is approximately 36 months with a year 2012 completion.

BY THIS POSTING, GSA WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN EARLY EXHANGES WITH INDUSTRY.  Parties interested in meeting with the Contracting Officer (Shelita Harper) and Project Manager (Mario Ramirez) should request a meeting by EMAIL no later than COB June 13, 2008 at 4:00 PM.  Meetings with interested parties will be scheduled individually during the week of June 23, 2008.  Please send the EMAIL to christopher.lee@gsa.gov.

This posting serves only as an invitation to express interest for those in the construction marketplace who are capable of performing the anticipated work.  Please note that the Government will not compensate any respondents for information exchanged during these meetings.  Interested parties shall not contact the Architect or their associated Consultants without specific authorization by the contracting officer.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a brand name procurement under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the purchase of Websense Security Software. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make a firm fixed price award, with option years, for Websense Security Suite Software. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Friday, 01 August, 2008, 4:00 p.m. EST.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiat for only one brand name under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may request or provide information. All information received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>Websense is used on the USSOCOM enterprise wide area network as well as the USSOCOM Strategic Entry Points (SSEP). USSOCOM depends on Websense to provide web filtering in our compliance layer of defense and to protect USSOCOM networks against both malicious code and cyber attacks via the internet. Websense is used to meet the needs of approximately 8,500 global users. USSOCOM has used Websense for several years; it is a certified software product for internet monitoring and access control that meets the requirements of USSOCOM and the standards of DoDI 8500.2. Without this capability, USSOCOM will not be able to effectively protect the networks being used to support the global war on terrorism (GWOT); it would greatly increase network vulnerability with a corresponding increase in opportunity for exploiting the DoD global information grid. Websense Security Suite software has the following capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; Block known threats before they reach the endpoint <br />&bull; Alert on potential network threats-<br />&bull; Identify security threats, such as malicious websites, protocols, applications, and HTTP traffic (on Port 80 and all other ports) and blocks their access at the internet gateway<br />&bull; Alert administrators on email-borne worm traffic in the network. <br />&bull; Proactively discover web security threats-ability to scan millions of websites per week, searching for threats. <br />&bull; Real-time security updates should be available within minutes of the discovery of a new high-risk threat with no administrative intervention required. <br />&bull; Alert when websites or brands are under attack and reports web server vulnerabilities- should include the three services which help organizations protect their websites, <br />&bull; Provide industry-leading web filtering capabilities-Product should include the industry's leading web filtering technology. This technology, should be the most comprehensive and accurate on the market, and allow organizations to manage productivity, reduce risk of legal liability, and improve bandwidth use. <br />&bull; Prioritize and manage traffic in real-time based on pre-set thresholds and without requiring administrative intervention. <br />&bull; Provide capabilities for identifying organizational security, productivity, legal liability, and network bandwidth consumption risks.<br />&bull; Provide an automated application verification and audit analysis capability<br />&bull; Provide visibility into enterprise operations and potential security threats</p>
<p>In addition, Websense has a unique central policy distribution. It allows for simultaneous policy distribution to multiple servers without the need to manually recreate policies for each server. Websense is also the only known product that could provide all capabilities to support the magnitude of the SOCOM network traffic and the diversity of the users that must be monitored and defended. The main requirement not met by other vendors is the requirement to scale to provide services to over 8,000 users.</p>
<p><br />To&nbsp;award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government not expected to be recovered through competition. Without this brand name procurement, the approximate cost of the duplication effort would be approximately $504,673.00 (outlined in table below) to the government as well as downtime and loss of resources not expected to be recovered through competition. These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees and the cost of replacing existing capability to insure interoperability and eliminate continued need to train for separate systems.</p>

<p>The costs not recovered through open competition involve resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated with downtime and lack of coverage during replacement phase of new technology.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) has been involved in a program evaluation of HCV screening strategies in the Bronx in collaboration with Montefiore Medical Center and Boston University. This project will provide DVH with critical information on the effect of improving existing risk-based screening strategies as well as the potential added benefit of routine screening among persons born in the years 1945-1964 among an at-risk, urban population. This patient population also has a higher anti-HCV prevalence, higher levels of unemployment, and lower levels of insurance coverage as compared with the general United States insured population. The primary care physicians who serve these patients may also be more likely to offer screening currently as compared with "an average" PCP working in an area of lower risk or perceived risk.
<p>(1) To examine HCV screening of Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA) adult members with a retrospective medical records review from 2000 through 2007, both annually and across subgroups of these members defined by demographic characteristics and by factors that increase risk of HCV.<br />(2) To assess the effect of targeted HCV risk and age-based screening criteria and practices on detection rates of chronic HCV infection with an available electronic reminder (a 'Best Practices Alert') that can notify physicians about a medical action to be recommended to be performed during the clinical visit. <br />(3) To examine hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among populations at risk for chronic hepatitis B and to examine hepatitis B vaccination rates among SEKP adult patients with a retrospective medical records review from 2000 through 2007; this will provide a comparison practices group for the HCV screening practices quality enhancement project.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Kaiser Permanente Georgia has the proprietary patient information.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available.

<DESC>Description of services

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  The period of performance will be for a period of 12 months from the date of award. 

Background 

        Currently, there is no resource or tool kit that recommends outcome variables a researcher might use for a comprehensive consumer health informatics evaluation. Some routinely used outcome variables include: demographic, psychographic, health information uses, health information gratifications, utilization, perceived consumer information needs, health literacy, readability, perceived information quality, and others. The envisioned resource will provide a reservoir of suggested outcome variables that will make it easier for non-domain experts to engage in research activities. It also will provide a guide that NLM can use to enhance intramural and extramural consumer health informatics evaluation.  

     There is a pressing need for a resource to help investigators with even the most straightforward consumer health informatics survey research challenges. For example, in a consumer health informatics survey, what is the optimal way to ask a respondents income and educational levels? (These are standard demographic outcome variables). Different researchers use different metrics and measures, but of the many choices, which is the most grounded in past research and is expressed in a way that is least obtrusive and encourages accurate responses? By answering this question as well as making recommendations for many others, the proposed resource would provide a comprehensive resource drawn from consumer health informatics, health communication, mass communication, health literacy, and health campaign research that lists recommended outcome variables, suggested measures to operationalize them --  all with appropriate citations. 
 
    In the future, the project might be turned into a comprehensive resource where experts will be asked annually to submit additions and revisions. The creation of the initial pilot for the resource, which is envisioned as a one year project, will demonstrate the potential of the resource transform NLMs consumer health informatics evaluation and influence the course of consumer health informatics research.  The proposed resource (and initial pilot) is a continuation of a consumer health informatics conceptual model that Logan and Tse presented at Med Info in summer 2008 (Robert A. Logan, Tony Tse, A Multidisciplinary Conceptual Framework for Consumer Health Informatics. Medinfo 2007 12 (Pt2):1169-1173) and a new white paper by the American Medical Informatics Associations consumer health group (Alla Keselman, Robert A. Logan, Qing Zeng-Treitler,Catherine Arnott Smith and  Gondy Leroy, Developing informatics tools and strategies for consumer-centered health communication) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. In press.


Synopsis:

      This pilot project will prepare a master resource of outcome variables and suggested measures to guide comprehensive consumer health informatics evaluation. This pilot project is to be done in collaboration with NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison as well as NLMs consumer health informatics working group. The primary responsibility for completion of the proposed work will be the contractors. 

    The contractor will provide a pilot for a comprehensive resource to inform future NLM consumer health evaluation projects. The eventual resource is envisioned as a tool kit NLM can use and also will be available as a professional development tool to other consumer health informatics researchers. The contractor will provide a minimum of 25 outcome variables, with a specific suggested measure for each variable, and a citation of the source. In cases where there are differences in approaches to variables, the contractor will include a short (3-4 paragraph) description why the suggested measure was selected from others that may be used. The contactor also should specify the academic disciplines where each suggested outcome variable commonly can be used in consumer health research among the following: journalism, public communication, social marketing, strategic communication, health communication, health literacy, science communication, health campaign, and consumer health informatics research.

       The resource will be written in Microsoft Word compatible format. The contractor will use Dreamweaver, or similar web creation software, to convert the Microsoft Word file into a format so it can be migrated to an Internet site. The Internet site can be created and maintained for the length of the pilot at the contractors home university. However, the web site will be transferred immediately at the time of request to the National Library of Medicine. The contractor will prepare the web site with technical collaboration with NLMs Office of Communication and Public Liaison, so its content seamlessly can be transferred to NLM (following the completion of the pilot). 

           The contractor also will provide a plan for the completion and sustainability of a more comprehensive consumer health informatics resource. This plan should include a minimum of 25 new outcome variables to be assessed, or supplemented to those assessed for the pilot. However, the contractor is not responsible for the research to complete these added 25 variables. The plan should make specific recommendations about how to sustain the resource. This includes a plan that could engage graduate students in the project in the future, recommendations to improve the website that the pilot will create, and ideas about additional venues to disseminate the resource.  


      Objectives:

     The contractor will prepare a plan of the measures to be assessed. The contractor also shall develop a list of recommended outcome variables to be added to complete a comprehensive resource in the future.

     For the pilot, the contractor minimally will propose a list of 25 outcome measures in the following areas: prominent consumer based demographics (such as age, income, education, race, ethnicity, geographic location, internet access, media use, etc) as well as self-efficacy, health literacy, and consumer health information seeking, The contractor is expected to propose and complete additions to this initial list. The contractor will annotate this list with appropriate citations drawn from the appropriate literature. 

    The contractor will provide a specific suggested measure for each variable, and a citation of the source. In cases where there are differences in approaches to variables, the contractor will include a short (3-4 paragraph) description why the suggested measure was selected from others that may be used. The contactor also should specify the academic disciplines where each suggested outcome variable commonly can be used in consumer health research among the following: journalism, public communication, social marketing, health communication, health literacy, science communication, health campaign, and consumer health informatics research.

    The resource will be written in Microsoft Word compatible format. The contractor will work with NLM to foster a seamless transfer of the content generated by the pilot from a website hosted by the contractor to NLM. To do so, the contractor will use Dreamweaver, or similar web creation software, and convert the Microsoft Word compatible file into a format so it can be migrated to an NLM managed Internet site. During the pilot, an Internet site can be created and maintained at the contractors home university. However, the web sites content will be transferred immediately to the National Library of Medicine at the time of NLMs  request. NLM also reserves the right to ask the contractor to close the pilot website upon transfer of the content to NLM. The contractor will prepare the pilot web site with technical collaboration with NLMs Office of Communication and Public Liaison, so the content and host seamlessly can be transferred to NLM.   
    
      The contractor also will provide a plan for the completion and sustainability of a more comprehensive consumer health informatics resource. This plan should include a minimum of 25 new outcome variables to be assessed, or supplemented to those assessed for the pilot. However, the contractor is not responsible for the research to complete these added 25 variables. The plan should make specific recommendations about how to sustain the resource. This includes a plan that might engage graduate students in the project in the future, recommendations to improve the website that pilot will create, and ideas about other venues to disseminate the resource.  


  
 


       Required tasks:

The following tasks are to be completed as outlined. 
      
Task description:

   Phase 1
           Subtask 1. A list of the 25 outcome variables to be assessed in the projects pilot year. The list shall contain phased in completion dates for completion that is spread out from the third to the 11th month of the project, described in Phase 2 below. 
         Subtask 2. The creation of a plan to recommend other outcome variables (not assessed in the pilot) that should be added in future years. This plan, which is described under synopsis and proposed work above, shall be done in monthly, iterative stages with reports given to the designated project officer in NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison.
       
  Phase 2
           Subtask 1. The contractor shall provide a list of recommended consumer health informatics outcome variables (drawn from journalism, public communication, social marketing, health communication, health literacy, science communication, health campaign, and consumer health informatics research). The recommendations should be completed in monthly, iterative stages with reports provided to the designated project officer in NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison. The requirements are specified under the synopsis and proposed work above.
       Subtask 2. The list shall include the operationalization of these outcome variables within suggested measures with applied examples and appropriate citations of prior use as described in the synopsis and proposed work above.
        Subtask 3. The contractor will provide a printed report to NLM that should be in Microsoft Word compatible format that can be easily transferred to the Internet.
             
Phase 3
          Subtask 1. Completion of a demonstration website (at the contractors institution) to demonstrate the pilots findings, so the contractors recommendations will have a wider public distribution. Technical meeting between the contractor with NLM staff so a transfer of the website can be accomplished with minimal NLM staff time from the contractors to NLMs servers. The meeting should be arranged by the contractor and the designated project officer at NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison.

Deliverables:

Phase 1 
Deliverables: Two months after the contract award when the first subtasks described in Phase 1 is completed and six additional variables described in subtask 2 are completed. Monthly progress reports will be due to the designated project officer at NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison.

              Phase 2
    Deliverables: Subtasks 1-3 should be phased in on a monthly basis starting in the third month after the contract begins and ending in month 11 after the contract begins. Monthly progress reports will be due to the designated project officer at NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison. 

             Phase 3 
      Deliverables: Subtask 1 should be phased in on a monthly basis starting with month eight after the contract begins and ending in month 12 after the contract begins. Monthly progress reports will be due to the designated project officer at NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison.  

Sole source justification

        This contract requires a consultant/contractor who has significant knowledge about current research in: consumer health informatics, mass communication, health communication, health communication, and health campaign research fields. In addition, it is highly desirable for the contractor to have experience and skills in working with staff at NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison and NLMs consumer health informatics working group. This combination of skills is important for the contract to be completed within a limited time frame and to enhance the collaboration and communication that will be needed between the contractor and NLMs Office of Communications and Public Liaison and NLMs consumer health informatics working group.
 
        It would take months alone to establish the type of communication and working relationship to ensure this project is successful if the contractor does not meet the above skills. Since the project is only 12 months, it is vital that the requisite skills and background outlined above be in place as a requirement for the award of the contract. 
  
        The contractor is unique in the U.S. There is no other health communication research center with scholars whose work encompasses all the academic areas needed to successfully complete this project. These areas include: journalism, public communication, social marketing, health communication, health literacy, science communication, health campaign, and consumer health informatics research. While there are health communication research centers in the U.S., there is none where the staff encompasses all these research skills within the same core unit. The Health Communication Research Center at the Missouri School of Journalism has been widely recognized for its research contributions and is a Health Communication Center grantee of the National Cancer Institute, and a grantee of the Missouri Health Foundations pioneering efforts in health literacy research.

<a href="mailto:Carolyn.E.Mallory@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>Sources Sought/Notice of Intent to Negotiate with One Source. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate a follow-on Architect-Engineer simplified purchase with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, Inc., herein after Kennedy/Jenks, the current onboard designer for the San Juan Water District, SJWD, to refine the drawings prepared under contract W91238-04-C-0032. This follow-on action will provide additional information based on the designer drawings which were to perform design efforts associated with the Hydraulic Improvements to the existing SJWD water treatment plant, WTP, associated with the Regional Water Conservation and Recycling Project in Granite Bay, CA. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Kennedy/Jenks under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, unless, as a result of analysis o f acceptable responses to this notice, a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation. The Sacramento District Corps of Engineers, Corps, is seeking to identify sources that are uniquely qualified to provide further design information on the WTP hydraulic improvements. The WTP was designed and constructed in the early 1970s by Clendenen and Associates Engineers. As a result of the excellent performance of the WTP using the Clendenen process, it will continue to be used by the SJWD into the foreseeable future. The Clendenen design was never developed commercially; therefore the SJWD WTP represents a one of a kind facility. Kennedy/Jenks completed the SJWDs Wholesale Water Master Plan during years 2000 and 2001. This comprehensive document has been the guide for subsequent WTP planning efforts, including the Hydraulic Improvements. The master plan was also the basis for the design and construction of several improvements to the WTP to increase reliability and treatment capacity. Kennedy/Jenks performed this subsequent planning and design work. They have invested many hours in learning and understanding the Clendenen design, including conducting field reconnaissance and WTP investigations to validate desktop evaluations, and developing system models and performance analyses on behalf of the District. The development of the Wholesale Water Master Plan, and the design and improvements to the WTP provides Kennedy/Jenks with the unique knowledge and qualifications to provide engineering and design services for the proposed Hydraulic Improvements. During the Wholesale Water Master Planning effort, Kennedy/Jenks utilized a specialized hydraulic model along with extensive field investigations and surveys of the SJWDs WTP, to identify several areas where hydraulic and process improvements were needed to optimize use of the WTP. Several of their recommended improvements have been implemented. These improvements and Kennedy/Jenks model should be updated with the current WTP configuration and calibrated with actual field measurements to allow proper planning of the proposed extensive Hydraulic Improvements. Kennedy/Jenks unique model cannot be duplicated in a timely, economic fashion, and again, makes Kennedy/Jenks uniquely qualified to perform the work. In addition to the technical qualifications, Kennedy/Jenks Consultants has developed a professional rapport with the State of California Department of Health Services (DHS) and have demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of the Districts unique WTP process, fostering DHS confidence in the design, filter configuration and performance of the SJWDs WTP. Kennedy/Jenks continued team building and interaction with DHS is critical for obtaining DHS buy-in and amending the Districts DHS water supply permit to ensure success of the proposed project. The most distinctive feature of the SJWDs WTP is the design of the filter system. The filter media profile, consisting of graded gravels, silica sand, and carefully specified anthracite, is similar to the typical design of a conventional WTP. However, the filter bas in design, underdrain design, and filter backwashing system utilizing dual-drive, up-flow modular filter backwashing units with hydraulic surface wash injectors is the only one of its kind in the world. Any work at the plant must be designed to allow the facilities to stay in operation during construction, and not affect the quality or quantity of treated water and the ability of the WTP to meet EPA and DHS requirements. Kennedy/Jenks has developed a detailed understanding of WTP operations through their exhaustive planning efforts as well as by working closely with treatment plant operators and staff over the past few years. They have earned the operators trust and they have effectively become partners with them during implementation of several design and construction projects; working closely with them to develop construction plans that allow them to meet their responsibilities to the public and regulatory agencies. WTP operators have communicated to the SJWD management and the Board on several occasions and expressed their desire to see Kennedy/Jenks continue on with the work at the WTP. This is another qualification that sets Kennedy/Jenks apart for consideration of the design work. Kennedy/Jenks involvement in planning, testing, design development, regulatory approval, and construction coordination of improvements to the SJWDs water treatment plant makes them uniquely qualified, and in the SJWDs opinion, the best choice, to continue the design of the next phase of the water treatment plant modifications; the Hydraulic Improvements, and any refinements. There are no Government-owned drawings or technical literature for the services described prior to the contract action. The design plans and specifications prepared under the contract action are for Government use and not intended for public release. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. The following are the 5 criteria that we will use for evaluation of qualification:<BR>1. Interested parties must be a licensed engineering, design and science firm and must be experienced in the fields. <BR>2. Information furnished should include detail of appropriate technical and professional qualifications. <BR>3. Information furnished must demonstrate the interested party is able to perform engineering and design efforts associated with the hydraulic improvements, and the ability to replicate the plant specific hydraulic model at no cost to the government and client in an expedited fashion. <BR>4. Information furnished must demonstrate firms experience with the planning, design, construction and operation of water treatment plants and specifically the Clendenen process. <BR>5. The interested party must pass a background security check. Information furnished as a minimum should include appropriate technical information and professional qualifications that demonstrates the firms ability to meet the minimum requirements listed above. <BR>Responses should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, total. Oral, facsimile or electronic mail responses will not be accepted. Responses should be sent to: Carolyn Mallory, Attn: CESPK-CT, 1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95814-2922 no later than 3pm local time 13-Aug-2008. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If the Government determines, based on the responses to this notice, that a full and open competition will be conducted, a synopsis will be placed in FedBizOpps announcing the acquisition; otherwise, the Government will proceed with negotiations with one source with no further notice.<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure help with interagency and international initiatives such as senior level briefs and bilateral consultations.  This proposed procurement is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to: CrossFit Inc. 3196 Willow Creek Rd, Ste. A103 Box 295, Prescott, AZ 86301.

SCOPE:   
1.)	Coast Guard members from various Deployable Specialized Forces (DSFs) will spend two (02) full days with CrossFit Founder and CEO Greg Glassman and/or members of his staff.  Glassman is a foremost authority on physical training and his program has been adopted by the U.S. Navy SEALS, other elite military units, professional Mixed Martial Arts fighters, Fire Departments and Police Academies around the world.  USCG members will learn basic movements and techniques to incorporate into current unit level fitness programs that are scientifically proven, safe and effective methods of physical training.  Although some units now use CrossFit principles in unit fitness programs, they have not received formal training to the extent offered by the proposed contractor.  This program will promote a safe training environment, ensure all attendees are uniformly competent, and allow all DSF unit members to receive the maximum benefit of instruction during fitness training. 


2.)	CrossFit Inc. si the only organization offering an instructor training that incorporates the use of constantly varied, functional movements executed at high intensity into a complete exercise program for aerobic and metabolic conditioning, core strength, and functional fitness training.  CrossFit is the exercise program of choice for many elite military units, and law enforcement officers, as well as mixed martial ares fighters and professional athletes.  It is the only program of its type that emphasizes functional strength training thorugh the use of kettlebells, gymnastics, weight training, and cardiovascular fitness.  CrossFit has provided training around the globe for law enforcement instructors, special operations forces, and numerous other private and government entities.

3.)	The cost of the certification staff is cheaper than other alternatives.  The company is made up of military veterans and they are discounting the training program.  CrossFit is currently utilized to train federal agencies and other service branches.  Their well established network of law enforcement and military clients and agencies, provide ongoing support to assist in effectively implementing the program and to identify and promote best practices after adoption.

4.)	The unique benefit of the CrossFit program is that they offer a broad, general, and inclusive form of functional fitness training incorporating both traditional and alternative forms of exercise and training.  CrossFits specialty is in not specializing.  Other vendors specialize in a particular of fitness:  Some will instruct only aerobic and traditional strength  training, kettlebell, some will teach only running, other are experts in bicycling.  CrossFits methods are open source.  Their results are proven in the fitness and exercise community.  CrossFits expertise is in full range of fitness and this specific seminar is geared toward certifying instructors in the CrossFit program.  CrossFit is a patented technique that no other vendors have come close to replicating.  One similar vendor has copied some of the CrossFit training principles, but was ceased from further instruction due to intellectual property infringement.




Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>Description: USDA/ARS, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL Location, has a requirement for a growth chamber to grow Arabidopsis plants with controlled humidity, photoperiod, temperature and light intensity. An important feature is dimmable lighting so that light can be varied from 0 to 500 micromol m-2 s-1 to allow for plant growth as a function of irradiance. Because Arabidopsis plants are short, a two-tiered growth chamber would maximize plant growth capacity within the cabinet, but still allow for larger plants to be grown in the chamber. We will initially use this chamber to compare photoperiod and irradiance effects on Arabidopsis genotypes differing in capacity for repairs of oxidative damage to proteins, but anticipate many other applications within the Unit. The Salient Characteristics are as follows: 1) Chamber must fit with a space of roughly 95" x 36" (1 x w) 2) Two-tiered reach in chamber is desired to maximize plant growth space 3) Temperature must be controlled from slightly cooler to slightly warmer than ambient (e.g., 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C with lights on) 4) Must have humidity control 5) Must have dimmable lighting, up to 500 micromol m -2 s-1 6) Water cooled condenser 7) Alarm to warn users when temperature and/or humidity is too high and/or too low 8) Installation and training as necessary&nbsp;9) Warranty information.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>

<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

The HLA types of these volunteers will be entered into the DoD and NMDP donor files as it is for all newly registered donors.  These allele typed donors are likely to become available for transplantation for searching patients more rapidly than those donors typed at the current standard intermediate level typing.  In addition to becoming more rapidly available, the Navy and NMDP will be able to determine what fraction of newly recruited volunteers add new HLA allele types and HLA allele level haplotypes  (combination of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1) to the donor files

The ability to more rapidly find donors; the ability to better determine the percentage of newly entering donors have novel HLA alleles and haplotypes; the ability to better determine the likelihood that each searching patient will be able to find a match; and the ability to improve the methods used for donor searches are each important for both individual patients and our ability to develop plans for future needs of the program to respond to needs of patients and potential casualties.

	The donors HLA typed through this contract shall be fully characterized at the allele level for each DNA base in the part of the HLA gene responsible for the biologic function of the molecule defined here as exons 2 and 3 for HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, and exon 2 for HLA DRB1.

	 For this contract, there shall be no ambiguity of HLA typing in the specific exons based on the complete list of HLA allele definitions for HLA-A,-B,-C, and -DRB1 as of the definition of January 2008 (WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System, January 2008). 

	To assure that all DNA bases that make up the HLA gene for exon 2 and 3 for HLA class I and exon 2 for HLA Class II are characterized, the typing shall be performed by individual base DNA sequencing (for example, Sanger sequencing).  Other DNA typing methods may not always assure the positive typing of every nucleic acid position.  Incomplete typing creates the likelihood that some new alleles will be missed, the precise allele typing data would be incomplete, and the requirements of this contract would not be accomplished.

	Buccal swabs from all 11,000 donors will be sent in a single shipment to the contract recipient by Federal Express.  Each sample will be identified by a unique bar code provided by the Navy.  There will be no personal identifiers on any sample.

	All testing and data submission and data acceptance for marrow donor transplant searching and data analysis to the Navy and to the National Marrow Donor Program shall be complete in 30 days for 95% (10,450 of the samples) and the remaining 5% (550 samples) shall be complete by a total of 60 days from original receipt of the samples for testing.

	Individual DNA base data shall be reported electronically in a format specified by the Navy. Data is to be reported as consensus sequence using only IUPAC nucleic acid symbols (a,c,g,t) in either upper or lower case.  The format is FASTA/Pearson and there can be any number of sequence lines, of any length to represent the nucleotide sequence.  Complete primer sequences shall be registered with the NMDP and the primer name shall identify the locus and exon the primer amplifies.  The primer shall be given a score of 8 in the probe scores section to indicate successful amplification.

	Submitted data will be the property of the Navy.  The contractor may use the data for public scientific reporting of new alleles, and will work with the Navy to be sure the same data is not reported twice.  The Navy may perform additional analysis and report genetic data.   Where appropriate, data analysis can be performed in a way including the contractor, Navy investigators, and investigators participating in the NMDP and NMDP programs.

	Quality control samples will be included for quality control purposes as part of the original shipment consistent with existing NMDP and Navy quality control programs and error rates will be no greater than accepted by NMDP for contract laboratories. The Navy will randomly select approximately 100 samples sent to the contractor and will repeat the DNA sequence.  If there is a discrepancy, the discrepancy will be verified.  The error rate shall be less than 1.5% of the samples tested by the Navy containing any error on any locus by the contractor.  

	Data reporting requirements for typing result and underlying data shall be reported to the NMDP and Navy consistent with existing NMDP data reporting requirements (modified if necessary to be consistent with this data). Data is to be reported as consensus sequence using only IUPAC nucleic acid symbols (a,c,g,t) in either upper or lower case.  The format is FASTA/Pearson and there can be any number of sequence lines, of any length to represent the nucleotide sequence.  Complete primer sequences shall be registered with the NMDP and the primer name shall identify the locus and exon the primer amplifies.  The primer shall be given a score of 8 in the probe scores section to indicate successful amplification and will be used for patients searching for matched donors and for data analysis to determine likelihood of patients finding allele matched donors and likelihood of each donor to express a unique HLA allele or unique haplotype at the HLA allele level.

	Additional data may be required by the Navy for underlying intermediate results, for example electropherograms, and shall be available electronically so that unusual typing results could be analyzed. An electropherogram is a specific graphic representation of DNA sequence data and is automatically provided by the sequencing equipment.  This can be readily sent in a computer file.  For some of the data, there may be a result that needs further explanation and we will need to look at the original data to understand how the contractor obtained the answer.

	The potential contract recipient shall have an existing contractual relationship with the National Marrow Donor Program to submit HLA testing data for inclusion of HLA data for inclusion as volunteer donors on the NMDP registry and for quality control of HLA typing data.

	The potential contractor shall routinely submit 2,000 or more HLA typing results per month to the NMDP with a typing accuracy acceptable as an NMDP contract typing laboratory. NMDP has routine quality requirements by testing imbedded quality control samples, for initial donor typing that has no more than 1.5% error rate.

	The potential contractor shall demonstrate the capability to HLA type large numbers of samples at the fully resolved level for allele testing for HLA-A,-B, -C and DRB1 using individual base DNA sequencing (for example Sanger sequencing).

	The laboratory shall have current American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics inspection approval as required by NMDP standards for HLA data submission by NMDP contract laboratories and associated CLIA / CLIP approval for HLA testing required by this contract at time of award.

	It is expected that a small percentage of the buccal swabs will not contain adequate amount of test sample.  For these, the Navy will attempt to provide additional samples which contain adequate amounts of DNA, but the Navy may substitute a sample from another volunteer if additional sample from the original donor is not available.  The data submission deadline will reflect the date the test laboratory receives the new buccal swab ( 95% of samples complete by 30 days and 100% complete at 60 days post receipt of sample).

	There is also the potential for DNA amplification failure because of an unexpected HLA allele, particularly if the new allele is located in the primer site.  For these, it may be necessary to use unique DNA primers to accomplish amplification and subsequent HLA sequencing.  The laboratory shall complete typing for those samples with unexpected HLA alleles.  There will be no additional charge to the Government for additional laboratory testing for samples with unusual types or amplification failure that require additional laboratory testing or additional sample and repeat or replacement testing.

The estimated period of performance is 30 September 2008-30 November 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.  

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 611310, is to notify contractors that the government is seeking competition under the simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following:  Researcher.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ)

The Governments period of performance is August 30, 2008  August 29, 2009.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking competition for the following services:  Researcher.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

BACKGROUND AND INFORMATION:  The Food and Drug Administration regulates complex medical devices that are in contact with or control the flow of blood (e.g., hemodializers, prosthetic heart valves, cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, ventricular assist systems, and artificial hearts).  The safety and effectiveness of these devices can be compromised, with resulting clinical sequelae, if cellular elements in the blood are damaged by contact with the device.  Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques for predicting flow fields and forces experienced by blood as it passes through these devices can be a valuable tool to assess new designs and modifications of existing designs.  Through FDAs Critical Path Program, we have initiated a project to design flow models which mimic medical devices and can be simulated computationally (using CFD) and validated experimentally (using flow visualization techniques).

CONTRACTOR TASKS AND DELIVERABLES: 
To research how existing computational fluid dynamic methods may be used in the design and evaluation of safety in new medical devices, the following tasks will be performed: 
1) engineering design of flow models representing blood contacting medical devices,
2) consultation on the fabrication of transparent flow models, 
3) evaluation of the flow models using flow visualization and other engineering modalities, 
4) development of computational representations of the flow models, 
5) evaluation of the flow models using computational fluid dynamic simulations, 
6) comparison of engineering test results obtained by both flow visualization and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and 
7) prediction of the blood damage potential of the flow models based upon mathematical models of blood damage applied to the computational simulations.

EVALUATION FOR AWARD
Basis for Award:

a.   Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.  Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.

b.   Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.

c.   FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.  FDAs acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror.  Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offerors technical solution is evaluated.  This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the governments assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

(1) experience with the design and analysis of blood contacting medical devices, 
(2) engineering design and precise fabrication of flow models, 
(3) use of computational fluid dynamic techniques to predict flow fields within models,

<CONTACT>Brian R. Ellis, Phone (202) 366-4843, Email brian.ellis@dot.gov
<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This Soliciation will lead to a contract to be awarded to conduct dynamic rollover testing under the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).</p>
<p>HISTORY</p>
<p>NHTSA's NCAP program has been publishing comparative consumer information on frontal crashworthiness of new vehicles since 1979, on side crashworthiness since 1997, and on rollover resistance since January 2001.  The testing and associated data collection requirements described in this contract will allow NHTSA to continue the agency's existing rollover resistance rating program in accordance with the requirements of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act of 2000 and recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).  Initially, a rollover resistance rating was assigned to a vehicle based solely on a vehicle's Static Stability Factor (SSF), which is the ratio of one half its track width to its center of gravity (c.g.) height.  Beginning with the 2004 model year, information derived from dynamic rollover testing has been factored in with the SSF in calculations that determine a vehicle's rollover resistance rating.</p>
<p>After soliciting public comments on proposed approaches to dynamic rollover testing and evaluating those approaches, NHTSA, on October 14, 2003, published a Final Policy Statement in the Federal Register (68 FR 59250) indicating that a fishhook maneuver test will be used in the agency's dynamic rollover testing and conducted according to a procedure contained in that policy statement.  (For reference, the agency's procedure for conducting a fishhook maneuver test appears in the attachment section of this contract.)  The Final Policy Statement incorporates recommendations of the NAS, which found that dynamic tests should complement static measures, such as SSF, rather than replace them in developing information for consumers on rollover resistance.  The NAS also recommended that NHTSA use logistic regression rather than linear regression for the statistical analysis of the relationship between rollover risk and SSF.</p>
<p>Section 12 of the "Transportation Recall, Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act of November 2000" reflects the desire of Congress to supplement SSF with a dynamic stability test using vehicle maneuvers.  Congress directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to "develop a dynamic test on rollovers by motor vehicles for a consumer information program; and carry out a program conducting such tests."  NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Light Vehicle Dynamic Rollover Propensity Test Procedure described in Appendix I was developed as part of NHTSA's effort to fulfill the requirements of the TREAD Act.<br />Section 10307 of the "Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act:  A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU)" requires that each new passenger automobile that has been rated under the NHTSA's NCAP must have those ratings displayed on a label on its new vehicle price sticker, known as the Monroney label.  NHTSA issued this final rule known as the "Stars on Cars" on September 7, 2006.  The rule took effect on November 13, 2006.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND PURPOSE</p>
<p>The overall objective of this contract is to collect information through testing that determines the rollover resistance of new vehicles so that vehicles can be rated in ways that are helpful to consumers.</p>
<p>DETAILS</p>
<p>Details of this Solicitation are in the Attached Soliciation Document and the Attachements provided.  All responses are required by August 26th.  Questions concerning this Solicitation shall be in writing to Brian Ellis, Contract Specialist, by no later than 2:00pm, August 15, 2008.  Any and all such questions must be in writing and submitted electronically, via e-mail, to Brian Ellis at the following address: brian.ellis@dot.gov.  No telephone requests, please.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(AR)-2008-193-RCO and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26 (as of 06/12/2008).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is set aside for small businesses. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) on behalf of National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) to procure the services from Beckman Coulter Inc., 1800 SW 147th Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33196, for the following product and service:

 a) MoFlo Laser Options, 488nm, 200 mW OPSI Diode (Model 16830) and b) on-site installation service.

 Summary: 
The above laboratory equipment and installation services are essential to NIAMSs continued research efforts under protocol # Number: 99-AR-0004 Entitled: Molecular Basis of Primary immunodeficiencies, led by Dr. John OShea, Scientific Director.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders to identify patients with mutations of the genes for the following proteins: Jak3, STAT1, STAT4, interleukin-7, interleukin-7 receptor, interleukin-12 receptor subunits, and others. The Lymphocyte Cell Biology Section requires the services of the cell sorter facility on a daily basis in order to continue on-going and active clinical research and the aforementioned protocol. Patients undergo screening history, physical examination, and clinical laboratory evaluation at referring institutions and tissue samples, or cell lines when sent to the NIH. The establishments of cell lines prepare DNA and RNA for molecular genetic analysis and study cytokine signal transduction in patient cell lines.  This clinical research study is essential for the continued care of Clinical Center patients at NIH.  The ongoing advancement of this research would not be feasible without the MoFlo Laser cell sorter and its cell sorting services. Furthermore, if the NIAMS aged cell sorter fails and/or deemed inoperable therefore, not repairable the current maintenance warranty would void causing financial loss to the government.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 28 (twenty-eight) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, August 28, 2008.

For this competitive, best value (lowest price, technically acceptable), total small business set aside procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
- 	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
- 	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, August 28, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses no later than the deadline of 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, August 14, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101. The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

<DESC>USAID Rwanda is seeking to put in place a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) between one or more firms that would allow USAID, at a future date, to contract simply and quickly with this firm(s) to provide services.  The BPA, in and of itself, does not directly or automatically provide funding to the winning firm(s).  The competition for the BPA allows any and all firms interested to submit their proposals to USAID describing how their firm is capable and qualified to perform the duties outlined in the BPA.  The winning firm(s) would then have signed agreement with USAID through which future contracts could be let easily.  For example, one of the tasks described in the BPA is for event planning.  An interested firm with capabilities in event planning could compete for the BPA.  If successful, the firm would then be able to be contacted by USAID at relatively short notice to organize and prepare a workshop or seminar.  The same situation follows for firms interested and having capabilities in the other three core areas described in the BPA: Economic Analyses, Evaluation and Strategy Development, and Coordination.  The combined value of all orders placed will not exceed $2,500,000 over the 5-year maximum period of this BPA.

USAID is encouraging interested Rwandan and East African firms to participate in this call for proposals.  USAID believes that local firms advantage of local knowledge, ability to respond quickly, and reasonable budget should allow them to compete for this BPA.  Partnerships between local firms and international firms which can provide a unique set of skills could also be advantageous.  

For those firms interested, USAID will hold a pre-proposal conference at USAID/Kigali at 0900 on August 20, 2008. At this conference any and all questions will be answered about this procurement.  All interested parties MUST contact Emerithe Kayitesi (ekayitesi@usaid.gov  or +250 596800x2824) with a copy to Aster Kebede (askebede@usaid.gov) by August 18, 2008 to let USAID know who will be coming to the conference on the 21st.  Persons who do not contact USAID by August 18 will not be allowed to attend the pre-solicitation conference on August 20th.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is August 20, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD: EVALUATION CRITERIAStatement of Work Project: Improved Educational Materials for Veterans and Family MembersReturning from the War Zone: A Course for Families of Military Personnel DESCRIPTION OF WORK The VA National Center for PTSD currently has a PDF titled "Returning from the War Zone: A guide for families of military personnel" posted on http://www.ncptsd.va.gov. This guide has been downloaded approximately 12,000 times over the last 6 months.  This acquisition is expected to range from $25,000.00 to $100,000.00.  For the full RFP document please contact Stacy Sullivan at stacy.sullivan@va.gov.  The goal is to adapt the War Zone guide into an online, interactive educational course that is more engaging than a written document and better suited to appeal to today's veterans and their families.  The most effective online courses today take advantage of a full range of multimedia techniques including color, movement, sound, video, and in a case like this should also engage the learner on an emotional level.  We seek a contractor who can satisfy these stated goals.Specifically the course will be designed to reach family members in dispersed locations.  The course will provide information on:"	Common reactions that occur following deployment to a war zone"	How expectations about homecoming may differ for service members and family members"	Ways to talk and listen to one another in order to re-establish trust, closeness and openness"	Information about potential problems "	How to offer and find assistance for loved ones"	What help is available, what it involves, and information on support resources The course must be 508 compliant per VA regulation 6102. It must also meet technical specifications in order to be uploaded to our website.  In addition it must be targeted to a lay audience such that it is comprehendible to readers at a 7th grade level.  We expect that the amount of time it will take to complete the course will be less than one hour in length.We believe that many of the elements listed below will be necessary in order to satisfy the stated goal, but look to the contractor to specify how to best meet the goals.  Possible elements include:"	Audio voice-over narration "	Photo images and flash-animated collages of still images to personalize and humanize the content and render it more accessible to users "	Interactive exercises (e.g., on recognizing combat stress reactions) to engage the user and ensure content mastery (NOTE: no persistent cookies allowed by VA)"	Modules that are specifically designed to address caregivers in the various stages of the emotional cycle of deployment (pre, during, post and redeploying) "	Links to resources providing "real-time" access to support and information, in order to enhance the user's  motivation to help their family service member immediatelyThe course should be tested with potential users to ensure that the module is relevant, accessible, and easy to navigate and then revise based on this feedback.  DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format. Electronic files will be supplied that can be uploaded to the NCPTSD Website and will meet all of the requirements as specified in the description of work above.SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor must have expertise in creating engaging educational trainings and curricula that are web based.  Experience in creating trainings in the area of health promotion is preferred. Understanding public information campaigns and branding preferred. Additional expertise in traditional and emerging technologies is required to insure that the course is disseminated effectively.  The contractor must have experience with e-learning and web-based trainings.  Experience translating science into practice preferred. The online Course will be hosted on the VA NCPTSD website accessible to the public at large. Website and server specifications are listed below.Website applications: See site at www.ncptsd.va.gov"	Java 5.0 or later (see above)"	Tomcat- version 5.5"	Apache 1.3"	Struts version 1 framework and code"	MySQL 4.0 databases"	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), html, java scripts"	Support for both mac and pc"	Movable type for content managementEVALUATION CRITERIAThe government will award a contract based on technical experience, past performance and cost/price.  FACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL APPROACHa)	Demonstrate your understanding of the solicitation requirements and submit a proposed approach to meeting and/or exceeding contract specification and deadlines.  b)	Demonstrate that you are currently and regularly engaged in creating interactive courses specializing in educational content focused on health/mental health for a lay audience.c)	Demonstrate proficiency in the use of learning principles and use of technology to create innovative educational programsd)	Describe the proposed Project Team for this effort and provide a brief resume of key personnele)	Describe how you plan to accomplish this work including completion dates.FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCEa)	Describe your past experience creating online courses using innovative approaches to learning and retention as specified in the scope of work. FACTOR 3: COST/PRICEa)	The pricing proposal should be specific and separate from the technical proposal.  It shall contain supporting cost information in sufficient detail to indicate how the offeror arrived at the proposed prices.  Factor 1: Experience and technical approach	Mandatory items satisfied	Total Maximum Points	Rating	CommentsSub factors:  a)  Ability to create engaging educational materials				b)  Knowledge in creating  web-ready materials as per Center's website specifications				c)  Description of how work will be accomplished including deadlines				d)  Submit a link to an example of an interactive course you have created.				e)  Create a plan to accomplish work including completion dates				Factor 2: Past Performance				Sub factors:  a)  Fully describe your past experience with creating and revising educational content as specified in the scope of work.

<DESC>Amendment 5

Final Questions

The purpose of this amendment is to post the final questions received from contractor questions.  Please review #7 carefully since the answer has been revised.  No further questions will be accepted.  Proposals are due August 1, 2008.  

1.  	Block 20, SF 1449, states that the contractor is to provide one prototype, and Q&A No. 43 confirms that only 1 prototype is required.
  Does the Government want the prototype to be a 1 bedroom, or a 2 bedroom, or 3 bedroom unit?  Or is the type of the prototype unit left to the discretion of the offeror?
This is at the discretion of the offeror.  Offeror may submit a 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom or any combination of the three options as their proposed design to FEMA.   Offeror should mark N/A in the CLINS and sub CLINS that they do not wish to bid on.  FEMA may award only certain CLINS depending on unit proposals.  

2.  Block 20, SF 1449, states that the Government anticipates multiple awards of an indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") type contract.  Does this mean that there definitely will be more than one awardee?  
Yes

3.  The RFP does not contain FAR Clause 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity, as required by FAR 16.504, "Indefinite-Quantity Contracts."  Will this clause be added by Amendment?   
Yes it will be added.  

4.   Q&A No. 61 indicates that the offeror is to "outline any limitations" it might have if an order exceeds its capacity.  

  Since FEMA contemplates an IDIQ contract:
i.  Will FEMA add by Amendment FAR Clause 52.216-19, Ordering Limitations, as required by FAR16.506(b)?  
Yes

ii.  Will FEMA provide the "maximum order" for any single order (because FAR 16.504(b)(4) requires the RFP to "specify the total minimum and maximum quantity of supplies or services the Government will acquire under the contract")?  
Yes

5.  Q&A No. 78 and 79 indicated that the Government is only obligated to buy one (1) unit, and that the Government does not intend to establish yearly minimum order commitments, either by CLIN, or dollar value.  However, FAR 16.504(b)(2) provides that "to ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity must be more than a nominal quantity, but it should not exceed the amount that the Government is fairly certain to order." 
  Is the acquisition of only one (1) unit more than a nominal quantity
Yes it is a minimum of one (1) to allow PM to test the unit to see if it meets our needs.  That is why FEMA is only guaranteeing buying the one unit.  But, if acceptable, more units will be purchased as required.
  What amount is the Government fairly certain to order?  
The one (1) unit. 

6.  Q&A No. 19, 20, 21 and 22, 60 and 62, ask for the relative weights of the technical factors and subfactors.  FEMA responded that "all criteria judged independently, no relative weights are specified." However, FAR 15.305(d) states that "all factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance shall be stated clearly in the solicitation."  
  Will FEMA provide the relative importance of all factors and significant subfactors?  
Yes, these will be incorporated into the solicitation.  

7.  Factor 1, Past Performance, at RFP page 5-4 states that "the Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on ability to supply items in a timely fashion that satisfies requests in terms of quantity and quality, including meeting warranty support."  However, the RFP does not provide a "Past Performance" Questionnaire for the offerors to identify its performance under prior contracts.  
	Will the Government provide the forms?  
No.  
  If the Government does not plan to provide the "Past Performance" Questionnaire: 
i.  what specific information does the Government require 
The contractor is to supply the contract number and award amount, contact person, title and telephone number for all relevant past performance within the last three years.  Please provide any performance rating or evaluations received during this time.

ii.  what is the minimum number of references, 
A minimum number of three references is requested.

8.  Q&A No. 29 (a), requested information concerning the "NOAA/FCC approved weather radio" and asked whether it was to be free-standing, or a fixed unit that was installed in the wall.  This answer remains unclear.  
  Is the radio to be wall-mounted (i.e., permanently affixed to the wall of the housing), or is it simply to be provided as a supply item?
Placement of the radio is at the discretion of the Offeror.

9.  Q&A No. 29 (b), references Pages 48 and 49 for the air test procedures.  The RFP does not contain a page 48 and 49.  Page 48 and 49 of the scanned pdf (Rugged Two bedroom park Model (RP) Procurement Specifications) generally address that there will be air testing, but do not provide any basic information such as:
i.  How long is the test to last;
ii.  What are acceptable levels of formaldehyde;
iii.  Do the homes have to be ventilated, not ventilated, for how long, etc.;
iv.  Please clarify this response.
See Attached IAQ Testing Procedures (already posted)
10.  Proposal Delivery Instructions
  The final line of the 1st Amendment reads:  There will be no electronic or hand delivered proposals accepted.  
i.  Does this mean that FEMA will only accept submissions by mail?  
ii.  Must the mail arrive at FEMA before 2:00 pm on August 1, 2008?
Yes

11.  Are you looking for wheeled housing solutions?  If so, then we won't be able to partake. 

This solicitation is not limited to wheeled housing solutions or those units equipped with permanent chassis.  The unit must be capable of being transported to the disaster location and installed on-site in a timely manner.

12.  Are any of the units going to be accessible for persons with disabilities?

If unit is accessible per Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards please indicate on proposal.

13.  Period of performance is noted as one year with four possible options for a total of sixty months. Does this mean the offerer must provide the prototype for inspection by FEMA within one year of the date of contract award?  
Upon negotiation of the award, FEMA expects production to begin immediately and unit acceptance to occur in under a month.  

14.  In the July 15, 2008, responses to questions submitted by contractors regarding RFP HSFEHQ-08-R-0106, the following question was posed:   5. "I have printed out the paper to put bids on.  How do we submit this to you? "  The FEMA response is as follows:  "Please submit electronically with your proposal to Linda Jackson, Contract Specialist, as stated on RFP."  This response is contradicted by FEMA in #2 of the "PROPOSAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS" section contained in the same document where contractors are specifically instructed by FEMA that:  2. "There will be no electronic or hand delivered proposals accepted." 
No electronic or hand delivered proposals are accepted.  Please mail into contract specialist as specified in the PROPOSAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS

15.  Are contractors being prohibited from either electronic or hand delivery of proposals?
Yes.

16.  Do we need to provide additional specifications within our proposal? Also under the line items. There are 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms.  Our unit is 1 open room that can sleep up to 6 people. How do we go about pricing this under the requirements you guys need?
Offeror may submit a 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 3 bedroom or any combination of the three options as their proposed design to FEMA.   Offeror should mark N/A in the CLINS and sub CLINS that they do not wish to bid on.  FEMA may award only certain CLINS depending on unit proposals.  

17.  What would be the minimum and maximum lease term years they would consider?
Lease program is at the discretion of the offeror.  FEMA prefers pricing to be completed with supplied pricing sheet in non-lease terms; however, Offeror may provide lease terms if they choose and include justification in the proposal.

18.  Considering that Modular Housing Units are now an acceptable configuration (Amendment 1), can the required indoor air quality testing be performed at the final assembly location which is different than the Point of Manufacture or Staging area?
No. 

 
19.  Can the Sofa be considered a bed? 

Yes

20.  What is the expected delivery time after award for CLIN 0001, 0002, 0003, and all respective SUB-CLINs?
For CLIN 0001, 0002, and 0003 as applicable:  Upon negotiation of the award, FEMA expects production to begin immediately and unit acceptance to occur in under a month.  

21.  The IAQ testing procedures for solicitation HSFEHQ-08-R-0078 2 BR Park Model requires a 7 day waiting period, testing on day 8, followed by another 7 day waiting period and testing on day 16. Does this apply to the current solicitation HSFEHQ-08-R-0106?
Yes.  Please see FEMA IAQ Testing Procedures attached.

22.  Are Insulation packages required to meet Energy Star standards? 
Please submit with proposal how the unit has met the energy star standards. 

23.  Do you want the Appliances to meet Energy Star standards?
Yes.

24.  If unit must be Energy Star Compliant, what region should it comply with?
Please describe which areas your unit is Energy Star compliant with proposal or how other locations can be served. 

25.  Is cable jack and TV jack the same item or two separate items? 
Two separate items. 

26.  Can you please define low emitting?  Is there a particular number you are requesting? 
Less than 0.016 ppm. 

27.  I understand that you want a MSDS sheet to be included with the proposal.  Would you like a MSDS sheet for all items or just the items with formaldehyde? 
Please submit MSDS sheets on all materials. 

28.  Can we have one consolidated staging are for all formaldehyde testing? 
Yes, please submit with proposal package. 

29.  Please describe the exact test method for formaldehyde and VOCs including any and all criteria associated with that testing.  Please describe if there is more than one testing method and is one method better than another.
Please see attached FEMA IAQ Testing Procedures (already posted with Amendment 3)

30.  Regarding the mattresses for the RFP ...should they be traditional spring mattresses or futon /foam mattresses or either.
At the discretion of the Offeror.  Mattresses should be able to sleep 3 to 8 adult occupants.

31.  Our standard units have been used in all of the states and noted in line 9. However, the FEMA unit (as currently designed) has not been deployed/used anywhere. So, how do we best answer Unit Development or Usage and Design Codes & Standards?

Please describe where your units are currently are and also submit the design/code for the unit being considered in your proposal.

32.  We are already registered on ORCA. There is one provision on page 5-5 (5.3 52.212-3 Offeror Rep...) We are to complete paragraph (1) only (I'm not sure what that is), the remaining paragraphs (b) through (k) are part of ORCA. The rest of the corporate part of the contract talks about the provisions but there's nothing really for me to fill out. Am I missing something?  Basically that leaves me with completing page 1 (signature page). Is this Correct?

It is the contractors responsibility to provide all documentation when proposals are due and as requested in FAR 52.212-3.  If you want to print out your ORCA details, please do so and send them in along with your proposal, however, again it is the responsibility of the contractor and not the government to make sure your proposal is complete.  

33.  HUD Code 3 Bedroom Homes - The specifications require a 5/16 x 3 lag bolt at each floor joist.  Are 9.3mm Dapia Approved Lag bolts acceptable?

Please submit any technical revisions to the code the unit complies with in the proposal.

34.  The Specifications require floor decking to be approved sealed, non-emitting plywood.  Is Phenol Formaldehyde plywood meeting HUD standard non emitting in excess of .2 ppm acceptable?

Please submit detailed approach with proposal to be reviewed with the package submitted and how it meets/exceeds the code the unit is designed to.

35.  Park Models - The specifications call for R-11 Insulation.  Are interior walls required to be insulated?

Please submit how the unit will be constructed and what code it meets with your proposal.

36.  The Floor and Ceiling specifications call for 5/8 Tongue/Groove Plywood.  Is this calling for the exterior surface of the floor to be covered with plywood?

This is referring to another project FEMA was working on. Please submit proposal and unit make up with proposal.

37.  The Dining room table is required to be on wheels or casters.  Will a fold down/ fold up or retractable table be acceptable?

Please submit how this meets or exceeds the requirement.

38.  The RFP is asking for a prototype but the FEMA BASE GUIDELINES clearly state that prototypes are not allowed.  Which controls?

The unit must be able to be constructed, not in a design phase.

39.  The FEMA BASE GUIDELINES state an approved QA/QC program should be in place.  How can this requirement be satisfied for a new product?

Please submit with proposal what the QA/QC approach for the product stated in proposal including staff, chain of communication, etc.

40.  Are new products, designed around the requirements of this RFP, acceptable for submission?

Please submit the design approach with proposal in accordance with the RFP requirements.

41.  Can past performance on other products be used to establish a track record/past performance for a new product?

Yes if similar to construction of unit proposed by Offeror.

42.  Can costs for cargo insurance on Units during transport be included in the price?

If this is a cost which will be part of the unit price, yes.

43.  If a similar guideline can be used for the design of the unit which meets either the spirit or intent of the FEMA BASE GUIDELINE, can those be used with explanations of any use of similar guidelines and the reasons therefore?

Yes. Please clearly state how this will meet or exceed the FEMA Base Guideline.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Synopsis The 95th Contracting Squadron (95 CONS) is seeking potential sources capable of performing airfield lighting control system (ALCS) maintenance services for Edwards AFB, CA. The contractor shall provide all management, personnel, tools, vehicles, supplies, materials, equipment, and labor necessary to maintain and repair ALCS. Edwards Air Force Base currently is using the Crouse Hinds Digitrac&Ocirc; ALCS. All work shall comply with Government and industry standards, whichever is more stringent. The contractor shall also be responsible for preventive maintenance and repairs. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this effort is 238210. Please indicate your firms small business status. Contract award is estimated to take place August 2008. Source Selection procedures can be found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.3-Source Selection, Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) and the Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement (AFMCFARS) thereto. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil and will be used to obtain the best value for the Government for this acquisition. In using the best value approach, the Government will award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that they will best satisfy our requirements in an affordable manner. The draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted incrementally on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This synopsis constitutes one form of early industry involvement and the Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback. This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Prospected vendor must provide proof of small business representation through the Central Contract Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 16.203-4(a), insert the following clause. The clause may be modified by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in paragraph (c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office. 

Economic Price AdjustmentStandard Supplies (Jan 1997) 

(a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for _________ [offeror insert Schedule line item number] is not in excess of the Contractors applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term unit price excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice. The term established price means a price that 

(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and 

(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. 

(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractors established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. 

(c) If the Contractors applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractors written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations: 

(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price. 

(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective 

(i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractors written request within 10 days thereafter; or 

(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request. 

(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause. 

(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price. 

(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractors written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase. 

(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Heitech Services, Inc to provide and format for publication reports documenting work on a significant long-term project.  The project involves formatting for publication the reports documenting the investigation of the collapse of World Trade Center 7.  This work is part of the federal building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center disaster led by NIST.  NIST is currently working to complete the investigation and anticipates preparing a summary report on the investigation of WTC 7 and two detailed reports on the investigation, including appendices documenting specific technical topics that were part of the investigation.  The drafts of these reports are expected to be completed in the summer of 2008 and ready for formatting at that time.  NIST will also need some graphics work for the covers of the reports and the labels on the Compact Disks (CDs) containing these reports.  

Sole source determination is based on Heitechs specific experience since the contractor has worked on prior versions of the remaining reports and is uniquely positioned to complete the remaining tasks within the tight time frame.

REVISED: The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 518210 Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and the size standard is $23M.

REVISED: No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received on or before July 29, 2008; 10:00:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This modification to a previously issued pre-solicitation notice makes the following changes:
The pre-solicitation notice was inadvertently released as a Q-request for quote when it should have been an I-invitation for bids. Therefore this notice is cancelled in entirety and is reissued as I632008M196. Because this announcement has met the regulatory time requirements the solicitation was issued on July 26, 2008.

Solicitation No.: GS-09P-08-KT-C-0089

Project Description:  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for qualified Offerors to compete for the construction of the new San Diego Federal Courthouse located in San Diego, California.  The project delivery method being used is the Modified Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc).     The Court's current facilities in San Diego do not meet their operational needs and requires additional space to accommodate their 10 year requirements through the year 2012.  The new Federal Courthouse facility will sit on a 2.6 acre, downtown San Diego site, bounded by Broadway Street to the north and State Street to the west.  Union Street will bound the project site to the east and E Street to the south, and both will be closed to vehicular traffic.  The project design architect is Richard Meir & Partners Architects LLP, and their design and construction documents have been completed and distributed to GSA as of April 2008.  The new facility encompasses approximately 467,000 gross square feet of space, which includes 98 non-public, underground parking spaces and is programmed to include 14 Courtrooms with an initial build out of 21 Chambers.  

Project Magnitude:  The estimated construction cost range is between $300 - $328 million.

In conjunction with the base contract there will be an exercisable owner's option for Construction Phase Services to complete the actual construction of the new courthouse.  The GMP option price for Construction Phase services will be negotiated during the Pre-construction phase.

<CONTACT>John e. Lynch (407)380-5197; john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil or Sandra Davey at 407-380-8288; sandra.davey@usmc.mil
<DESC>Provided below is a list of questions from industry and  answers provided by the government.  Please note that the Government shall not be held liable or accountable for answers to questions or direction given unless directed by the Contracting Officer through the RFP or RFP Amendments. 
Question 1 CLIN 0001, MOBILIZATION, for all four sites. Both Section F and the SOW state that the period of performance for the mobilization effort is one month, 1 Jan 2009 through 31 Jan 2009. However, each of CLINs 0002 through 0011 calls for 12 months of services to be supplied. Section F also shows the period of performance to include the month of January 2009. Should this quantity/period of performance be 11 months since mobilization occurs during January 2009? Should the Contract Start Date (CSD) then be identified as 1 February 2009?
ANS.  The period of performance for the Mobilization and the Contract will be revised in the final RFP.

Question 2 CLIN 0005 and CLIN 0006 are for SWET and MAET training, respectively, at Camp Lejeune. However, no MAET facility or equipment is currently located at Camp Lejeune so only SWET training is presently being conducted there (CLIN 0005 structure). CLIN 0005 is the only CLIN that separately calls out and separately prices SWET training. CLIN 0006 is representative of the other three bases, which train both MAET and SWET requirements. Based on this structure, we assume that CLINs 0005 and 0006 are mutually exclusive. Is this assumption correct? If the Camp Lejeune MAET facility is not ready by 1 January 2009, will the Government exercise CLIN 0005 only for the period that the facility is not ready? How much notice will the Government provide when transitioning from CLIN 0005 to CLIN 0006? 
ANS.  the CLIN will be revised in the final RFP.

Question 3 CLIN 0011 calls for IPHABD Repairs and Refurbishment. This CLIN does not distinguish between sites. Is this CLIN intended to capture the repair and replacement costs for all contract sites? Is this CLIN intended to account for all costs associated with the IPHABDs; i.e., labor, supply support, and other direct costs? 
ANS. In the final RFP there will be additional CLINs to cover each site for IPHABD repair and refurbishment.  CLIN is all inclusive.
Question 4 CLIN 0014 calls for Sea Repair and Refurbishment. This CLIN does not distinguish between sites. Is this CLIN intended to capture the repair and replacement costs for all contract sites? Is this CLIN intended to account for all costs associated with Sea; i.e., labor, supply support, and other direct costs? 
ANS.  Refer to answer on question 3.



Question 5 CLINs 0015 through 0030 deal with the acquisition of MAET Reconfigurable Panels. The QUANTITY and UNIT identified in these CLINS are 1 and EACH respectively. Does 1 EACH identify one set of panels for the MAET or one individual panel? 
ANS.  One set.
CLIN 0030 identifies the UNIT as LOT, but the other panel-related CLINs identify the unit as EACH. Should the unit be EACH? If not, please explain LOT. 
ANS.  The CLIN will be revised to read Each 
Question 6 CLIN 0032, TRAVEL. We assume this FFP CLIN is intended to fund the twice yearly Site Manager Conferences. Where will these conferences be held? 
ANS.  At any of the four sites.
Question 7 CLIN 0231, SURGE PERSONNEL, is the first occurrence of the requirement to price a Surge requirement. The UNIT for this CLIN is LOT. Does the Government require the capability to exercise surge personnel prior to Year 3 of this contract? Please explain LOT. Since this CLIN is not site specific, does the Government request a single contract surge rate or a rate by site? What is the difference between the Surge Personnel CLIN and the Over & Above requirement CLIN? 
ANS.  In the final RFP, there will be no Surge Personnel CLIN.
SECTION C Question 8 Section C.1, STATEMENT OF WORK, states, The Contractor shall furnish the necessary services, supplies, facilities, and materials . . .  Since all of the efforts associated with this contract are conducted on Government-provided facilities, what facilities does the Government expect the contractor to supply? 
ANS. None  Government provides facilities.  SOW will be revised.
 SECTION F
Question 9 Section F.1, CONTRACT PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, does not indentify the CSD in Lot I. Since the mobilization period is identified as 1 Jan  31 Jan 2009, it is assumed that CSD is 1 February 2009. Is this correct? 
ANS.  Refer to answer on Question 1.
 

SECTION H Question 10 Section H.1, OVER AND ABOVE WORK REQUESTS, paragraph (a) states that this clause may only be used to support requirements that fall outside the total labor hours for one or more sites. Please clarify, what are the total labor hour requirements for each site? 
ANS.  the paragraph will be revised to say, outside the operational hours in the final RFP.  
SECTION I Question 11 Clause 252.217-7001, SURGE OPTION, paragraph (a) (1) calls for an increase of supplies or services under the contract by no more than [ ] percent. Please identify the percent increase of supplies or services that the Government expects under the surge option clause. 
ANS.  The Clause will be changed to 252.217-7001, para. (a)(2).  
SECTION L Question 12 Section L.1, ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE, identifies the anticipated award date as 1 January 2009. This date is also the mobilization start date. 1 January 2009 is also a federal holiday. Please clarify the expected contract award date. 
ANS.  The contract award date will be identified in the final RFP.
Question 13 Section L.5, TIME, DATE AND PLACE FOR RECEIPT OF SUBMITTALS, paragraph (a) indicates that final proposals will be due on 5 September 2008 at 1600 hrs EST. Is this the correct date and time for final proposal submittals? 
ANS. The due date for final proposals will be identified in the final RFP.
Question 14 Section L.6.1, ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT, VOLUME I, FACTOR 1, states that the offeror shall provide resumes of key personnel as described in SOW Paragraph 3.4. The referenced SOW paragraph only implies that the Site Manager is the key employee. At the same time, Paragraph 3.4 references the qualification requirements of site personnel as delineated in Appendix C. However, Appendix C does not identify any key personnel. Please identify which employees are key personnel? 
ANS.  All employees at each of the traininig sites are key personnel.  See SOW para 3.4, and appendix C.  See SOW parAns. 3.2.1.  
Question 15 Section L.6.1, ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT, VOLUME I, FACTOR 3: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, SUBFACTOR 3.2: SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN, establishes a requirement for the contractor to identify and document its commitment to small business organizations. This acquisition is identified as a small business set-aside. By definition, the prime contractor must perform at least 51% of the labor effort associated with the program. Is the government requesting a small business participation plan that quantifies small business participation beyond the efforts that will be accomplished by the prime contractor? 
ANS.  this will be removed from Section L.
Question 16 Section L.6.1, ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT, VOLUME I, FACTOR 4: PANEL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM, reference to SOW paragraph 3.6 should instead reference SOW paragraph 3.9. 	ANS.  Will revise.
Question 17 Section L.6.1, ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT, VOLUME III: PRICE, provides an example of how panel costs will be evaluated. The CLINs referenced in the example, CLINs 0108, 0109, and 0110, are incorrect. The example CLINs should be 0115, 0119, 0123, and 0127. 
ANS.  Will revise.
Question 18 Section L.11, LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT SMALL DISADVANTAGE BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING GOAL. Is an SDB subcontracting goal associated with this acquisition? 
ANS.  This will be removed from Section L.
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) Question 19 Paragraph 1, SCOPE, the third paragraph, first sentence states: Additionally, the Contractor shall provide a source for optional panels for the MAET (configurations  such as MV-22) and variations of the MAET (SVET) and shall adapt training to meet the requirements for training with those panels. What is meant by adapting training to meet the requirements with the new panels? PM will change to shall modify/adapt training and/or curricula as required to include additions/modifications/panels, etc. to the training device.  Is the contractor required to make curriculum changes to the MAET course of instruction?Yes.  Who is the USMC MAET curriculum approval authority? TECOM.  Will the Government provide the contractor the government-approved MAET course of instruction with this RFP?  No
Question 20 Paragraph 1, SCOPE, in the first paragraph the initial period is identified as 1 January 2008 through 31 December 2008. Dates should be 2009. 
ANS.  Will revise.  
Question 21 Paragraph 1.3.1, BASIC LOTS, identifies three contract options. Section F identifies four contract options. We assume the reference in paragraph 1.3.1 should be to four contract options. 
ANS.  Four contract option years.
Question 22 Paragraph 1.3.3, CONTINGENCY PLANS, and Paragraph 1.3.4, SURGE CAPABILITY. What is the contractual or performance difference between the two plans referenced in these paragraphs? Both paragraphs require the submittal of plans to handle doubling the number of courses for the two-day curriculAns. Paragraph 1.3.4 also references paragraph 3.9 for the definition of the surge period. This reference is incorrect. 
ANS.  Paragraph 1.3.3 is an overall contingency plan in case of an emergency which will be delivered as a CDRL.  Paragraph 1.3.4, Surge Capability, will be required on a case by case basis when the government actually experiences a surge of personnel.  
Reference of para. 3.9 will be corrected.
Question 23 Section 2, APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS, there is no reference to the MAET Technical Data Package (TDP). What constitutes the MAET TDP and where is it located?  When will it be provided to the bidders, as indicated in SOW Paragraphs 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. Also in Section 2, and in Appendix B of the SOW, reference is made to MCO 1510.25, Individual Training Standards for Marine Combat Water Survival Training (reference only). Does this document contain the Government-approved training performance requirements and associated curricula? When will this document be provided to the bidders? 
ANS.  These paragraphs are being revised.  
Paragraph 2.2, NON-GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, the two referenced documents were not included with the draft RFP package. When will these documents be provided to the bidders? 
ANS.  Will post the two ITSs with the final RFP.    Question 24 Paragraph 3.1.4.1, PRE-CSD MEETING, the 30-days-prior-to-CSD requirement to conduct this meeting does not align with the stated contract award date, mobilization date, or implied CSD. Please clarify when the Government expects to conduct the pre-CSD meeting? 
Ans.  Will be clarified in the final RFP.
Question 25 Paragraph 3.1.4.3, SITE MANAGERS/PROGRAM MANAGER REVIEW MEETINGS, where will these meetings be held? 
Ans.  At all of the four training sites.
Question 26 Paragraph 3.1.5.1, CONTRACTOR INSTALLED MODIFICATIONS. This paragraph states that it is within the scope of the contract for the contractor to install any and all COR/Government-approved modifications. As it is written, this is an unbounded requirement, as there are no identified limits of what systems or components this requirement applies to. For example, there may be costs for providing necessary skilled labor that exceeds the capabilities of the MAET on-site staff. There may be subcontractor or ODC costs. There is an inherent assumption that the installation of these modifications will not impact training; therefore, it is feasible that overtime will be needed in order to accomplish the installation. Please provide definitization of the requirement. 
ANS.  The COR cannot make any changes to the contract, only the Contracting Officer.  This para. Will be revised.  No overtime will be allowed.
Question 27 Paragraph 3.1.7.1, SUPPLY SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS, states that the contractor is not required to provide replacement items for GFE/GFM items associated with each training device. We assume that this statement is indirectly referencing Appendix D of the SOW. That is, the contractor is not responsible for replacing any of the items that are listed in Appendix D. Is this correct? 
ANS.  That is correct.
Question 28 Paragraph 3.1.7.3.1, REPLENISHMENT LIABILITY LIMITATION, there is no liability cost limit established in Section H. Please clarify. 
ANS.  Clarification will be provided in the final RFP.

Question 29 Paragraph 3.1.7.6, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Can the contractor use base HAZMAT resources? 
ANS.  Contractor shall not rely on government HAZMAT resources.  
Question 30 Paragraph 3.1.8.1, PROVISIONING, there are no training devices listed in the SOW. Please clarify. 
ANS.  See para. 1.1
Question 31 Paragraph 3.1.9, TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION, there is no Technical Documentation (TD) listed in the respective appendices for the training devices. Please clarify what TD will be provided for each of the training devices and all its support equipment. 
ANS.  See answer to question 23.  
Question 32 Paragraph 3.1.9.3, CLEANING, please clarify that the contractor is not responsible for maintaining the facility pools. There are no training system/device appendices provided in the SOW. Can the Government provide facility floor plans that identify the contractor spaces and what areas they are required to maintain? 
ANS.  Government is in charge of pool maintenance.  The PM will consider providing facility floor plans that identify the contractor spaces and what areas they are required to maintain.
Question 33 Paragraph 3.1.9.11, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, does this requirement include a continuous review of the MAET curriculum? 
ANS.  Yes
Question 34 Paragraph 3.2.1, TASK 1, states: The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel: to deliver appropriate SWET, MAET, SVET, IPHABD and SEA underwater egress training as well as surface water survival training . . .. Paragraph 1, SCOPE, second paragraph states: . . . the Contractor shall provide a program which focuses on the capability of training Marines who may or may not be strong swimmers in the same setting as strong swimmers without any remedial swim training. Paragraph 1 states that remedial swim training is not required, but Paragraph 3.2.1 states that surface water survival training is required. All surface water survival training courses entail some degree of remedial swim training. Please clarify to what extent the contractor is responsible for remedial/surface water survival training as part of this contract. 
ANS.  This is egress-centric training.  See para. 1  Scope.
Question 35 Paragraph 3.2.1, TASK 1, we assume that the term MAET, as used in this draft RFP and SOW, is a generic term used to describe the USMC Modular Amphibious Egress Trainer (MAET) requirement and not the XXXXXX industry trademark that they have associated with their product. Subparagraph d. of 3.2.1 identifies a Certified OEM Level III Technician-MAET/SVET Maintenance & Operation. Neither the SOW nor the draft RFP provides any explanation of why an OEM-certified Level III Technician is required or what the professional qualifications of this individual are. Since XXXXXX is the incumbent, it is not reasonably to be expected that they will freely provide information clarifying what this certification entails, why it is unique, or how long and what it costs to certify personnel to operate the XXXXXX MAET training device. The MAET training device and associated control station are a run-of-the-mill gantry system with some routine cable system controls to lower and rotate the system in the water. Please clarify why the MAET operator must be OEM certified. If the position must be manned by an XXXXXX-certified technician, please identify the certification requirements and the length of time and costs required to certify personnel to meet the stated requirement. Subparagraph c and e of Paragraph 3.2.1 use the word trained relative to instructors and safety divers. We assume that trained refers to individuals who have experience and training in egress from submerged aircraft and submerged vehicles, and not to specific training or certification from XXXXXX. Is this correct? 
ANS.  The PM will revise.
Question 36 Paragraph 3.2.6. TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION/TRAINING MATERIALS, when will the Government make available copies of the MAET TDP and training materials? 
ANS.  These documents will be made available with the final RFP.  All will be provided on the NECO website on or around 8/18/2008.  
Question 37 Paragraph 3.3, COURSE CURRICULA, this paragraph states . . . The Government will furnish all approved curricula and materials including lesson plans, slides, films, and exams. The Contractor shall demonstrate a proven capacity to expand the training curriculum to include training in the MAET/SVET with full personnel equipment and gear. To what standards must the new or modified curricula material be developed? To the current standards per the PM.  Is this development considered in scope of this contract?  Yes.   How many lessons or hours of deliver training are deemed in scope?  Two-Day training, minimum 16 hours.  Who is to provide the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to evaluate the curricula changes?  The Government.  

Question 38 Paragraph 3.6, MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, states that the Government shall provide all the special tools for the MAET/SVET for all sites. Please provide a list of these tools. 
ANS.  Will provide.
Question 39 Paragraph 3.9, FUTURE PLANNED PANELS/MODULES  REFURBISHMENT OF SYSTEM, will the Government provide specifications for the existing panels? Will the Government provide specifications for the new panels? (Note: Reference the earlier question associated with paragraph 3.3 and demonstrated capability to expand the training curriculum. The same question applies to the last sentence of paragraph 3.9.) 
ANS.  The current system is a COTS system.  Panels are also COTS.  
Question 40 Appendix C Personnel/Instructor Qualification for Egress/Dunker Training 
We assume that the term MAET, as used in this draft RFP and SOW, is a generic term used to describe the USMC Modular Amphibious Egress Trainer (MAET) requirement and not the XXXXXX industry trademark that they have associated with their product. Otherwise, the specificity of MAET OEM (XXXXXX) certifications and training in the Appendix C qualifications lends itself to limiting competition as it pertains to this acquisition. 
ANS.  The PM will revise Appendix.
Egress training is presently provided by a number of organizations other than XXXXXX. One of the largest underwater egress programs in the world is run by the US Navy (NOMI). This program is highly successful and has numerous personnel who are highly qualified MAET instructors, safety divers, EMTs, and system operators. The specificity of OEM-only certifications  in this case XXXXXX, who is also the incumbent contractor  in Appendix C would deem these more than qualified US Navy and civilian professionals as unacceptable to work on this program because they do not have the XXXXXX certification or experience. The following questions point to some specific qualifications questions: Paragraph 1. a.1)C)states that the Supervising Instructor must hold a valid certificate in Surface Water Survival. What organization(s) certify the Supervising Instructor as Surface Water Survival competent? What are the professional requirements for Surface Water Survival certification? Paragraph 1.a.1)D)  states that the Supervising Instructor must hold a valid certificate in MAET/SVET instruction. What organization(s) certify the Supervising Instructor as MAET/SVET instruction competent? What are the professional requirements for MAET/SVET instruction certification? Paragraph 1.a.1E)  states that the Supervising Instructor must have a minimum of 2 years experience in MAET Operations for passengers. Is this experience requirement limited to USMC MAET experience? Paragraphs 1.a.2, PRIMARY INSTRUCTOR and Paragraph 1.Ans.3, ASSISTANT/SECONDARY INSTRUCTOR, have similar certification and experience requirements. The questions above are also relevant to these positions. 

Paragraph 1.a.4) C), SAFETY DIVER, states that this individual must hold a valid certificate in MAET/SVET Safety Diving. What organization(s) certify the Safety Diver as MAET/SVET Safety Diving competent? What are the professional requirements for MAET/SVET Safety Diving certification? 
Paragraph 1.a.5) C) states that the Medical Staff must be trained and qualified and/or certified as a Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician. Please clarify the differences between trained and qualified EMT and certified EMT? 
Paragraph 1.a.6) A) states that the Simulator Operator must hold a valid OEM Level III Technician certificate. Neither the SOW nor the draft RFP provides any explanation of why an OEM-certified Level III Technician is required or what the professional qualifications of this individual are. Since XXXXXX is the incumbent, it is not reasonably to be expected that they will freely provide information clarifying what this certification entails, why it is unique, or how long and what it costs to certify personnel to operate the XXXXXX MAET training device. The MAET training device and associated control station are a run-of-the-mill gantry system with some routine cable system controls to lower and rotate the system in the water. Please clarify why the MAET operator must be OEM certified. If the position must be manned by an XXXXXX-certified technician, please identify the certification requirements and the length of time and costs required to certify personnel to meet the stated requirement.
ANS.  The PM will revise the SOW in terms of level of training and certs required.
