<CONTACT>Joe Pratt Contract Specialist 2083785139     jpratt@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Region of the Bureau of Reclamation has a need for the construction of various types of fence on lands around the Cascade Reservoir.  The small business size standard for this acquisition is $12 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three accounting periods, and the NAICS code is 238990. The types of fencing include: single-rail lodgepole pine; barb wire; and chainlink.  Some areas are more accessible than others and most installations can be completed in under one week.  In some instances, Reclamation may provide materials for the lodgepole fencing.  We intend to award one or more ID/IQ contracts, each for a 1-year period with four 1-year Option periods.  The price range for 5 years of the fencing work is $100,000 to $250,000, but if more than one contract is awarded it's unlikely any single contract will reach the upper limitation of that range.  If more than one contract is awarded, Task Orders under the contracts will be competed pursuant to FAR part 16.5. We anticipate posting a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation approximately 15 days after this notice appears, but all dates in this synopsis are subject to change.  The RFP will issued via our website at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts but we reserve the right to issue the RFP on paper if the website becomes inoperable or if we determine it's in Reclamation's interest to do so.  Amendments to the solicitation will be posted via the website so offerors should check the site frequently after the solicitation is posted.  Offerors should visit the website after July 7, 2003,  to register to be included on the offeror list to receive convenient e-mail notification of amendments and to encourage subcontracting and partnering/joint venture opportunities.  Offerors will be asked to submit a technical and cost proposal for the ID/IQ contract.  Offers will be evaluated on their successful past performance of similar requirements, the experience and capabilities of their proposed key personnel, proposed prices, and other factors.  This requirement is not a set-aside.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by this agency.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for engineering support for the advancement of 2D and 3D direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) codes. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the engineering support from GAB Consulting, as the only known source who can meet Agency requirements. The proposed support focuses on enhancing the portability, parallelization, improved resolution of surface shear layers, and documentation of both 2D and 3D codes.	All of the current DSMC codes currently in use at Langley Research Center are either developed or based upon the physical models developed by GAB Consulting. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Extended Safety of Once Daily Oral Tenofovir for HIV Prevention Among High-Risk Men who have Sex with Men
      
A. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE:    

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiretroviral agents (ART) has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of HIV seroconversion after occupational exposures, and there is evidence to suggest that PEP may also reduce the risk after sexual exposures.  The purpose of this project is to determine whether ART taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (ie., before a sexual exposure occurs) is safe on a long-term basis.  The agent chosen for the study is Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) which is taken once daily and which has a strong safety and efficacy profile when used as a therapeutic agent.  This study will be done in coordination with an independently sponsored trial that will examine the safety and efficacy of this agent among heterosexual women in Africa and Asia. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either TDF or its placebo and will be followed for any adverse effects of the agent, any changes in their sexual behavior, and HIV incidence.  Results of this study will determine whether TDF is safe and acceptable for long-term use among men who have sex with men (MSM), whether such use might affect participants’ sexual behavior, and whether such use should be further investigated to demonstrate efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition among high-risk MSM.

B. BACKGROUND AND NEED:   

The HIV epidemic is continuing to grow and the predominant mode of transmission worldwide is sexual.  Sexual abstinence or consistent and correct condom use are the only methods currently recommended for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV yet many at-risk persons are either unwilling or unable to remain abstinent or to use condoms with every sexual act.  An effective, easy to use method of prevention is urgently needed.  Topical microbicides are being developed in hopes of offering at-risk persons a method to protect themselves from infection when condom use is not possible.  However, no microbicide candidate has shown effective protection from HIV in human trials.

Ever since the development of the first antiretroviral agents, the potential of ART to prevent HIV acquisition has been explored.  Non-perinatal studies have looked at ART given as post-exposure prophylaxis, i.e., after a person has been exposed to HIV.  PEP was shown to dramatically decrease the risk of HIV seroconversion among persons who had been occupationally exposed.  Similarly, even though no definitive human studies of the efficacy of PEP for sexual HIV exposures exist, much animal and anecdotal evidence suggest that it may reduce the risk of transmission, and many healthcare providers currently offer it to persons who experience isolated exposures.  PEP appears to have varying degrees of effectiveness depending on how long after the exposure it is given. This has raised the question of whether ART would be even more effective and potentially able to be used by greater numbers of at-risk persons if it were to be used before the exposure takes place, ie., as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP).  Given the continued growth of the HIV epidemic and the relative lack of HIV prevention options, the concept of using a daily oral antiretroviral to prevent HIV transmission merits further exploration and testing.  

As noted above, condoms and potential topical microbicides require consistent and correct use during every coital act.  This is similar to the situation when barrier methods were the most common forms of nonpermanent contraception.  However, when hormonal oral contraceptives were introduced and the preventive method became disassociated with coitus, contraception became easier, popular, and more effective at the individual and population level.  TDF has been selected for investigation as chemoprophylaxis against HIV in high-risk individuals because of its’ unique pharmacologic profile.  In addition to TDF’s convenience of being a once daily single tablet with a safety profile comparable to placebo among HIV infected persons, it has striking anti-HIV potency and a low potential for selection of resistant viruses.  Each of these properties is necessary given the realities of the intended target populations.  Moreover, initial prevention studies in simian models have provided encouraging results.  

An independently funded study is currently in the planning stages for an expanded safety and efficacy study of TDF among sexually active heterosexual women in Africa and Asia.  Another population that is most likely to eventually use HIV chemoprophylaxis should it be proven to be safe and effective would be high-risk MSM, and thus it is imperative to determine in parallel with this international study whether TDF is safe for use by men.  Of note, the public health policy issues associated with the use of oral HIV chemoprophylaxis may be substantially different for MSM as compared to heterosexual women in the developing world.  As an example, there is concern that the potential for increased risk behavior may be greater for MSM.  The availability of an oral agent may induce some men to switch from the most effective prevention method (condoms) to one that is less effective (TDF).  It is likely that TDF may be highly effective against HIV (i.e., > 80%) but it has no efficacy against other sexually transmitted infections (STI) such as syphilis and gonorrhea.  Modeling exercises have indicated that the availability of a less-effective method but which is used more often can result in a large decrease in HIV transmission.  However, decreases in transmission of HIV would need to be considered in the context of the potential for increased transmission of other serious, although generally non-fatal STI.

Currently, EDS provides mainframe computing platform resources, services, and support for Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) 1.0 processing and components of DEERS 2.x, and system administration support and other services for the DEERS 2.x UNIX-based processing. The DEERS 2.x UNIX processing is performed on Government-furnished equipment (GFE) computing platforms; the current contractor is responsible for the environment and access to the environment.  The mainframe and UNIX services are critical for the Defense Manpower Data Center’s (DMDC) mission of providing and maintaining personnel information for DoD.  The new requirement requires the Contractor to provide services for 1) Main-frame processing including CPU, disk storage, tape storage, communications devices (FEPs) and other components necessary to support the DEERS mainframe processing.  2) Mid-range operations where the Government provides the data processing equipment including the CPU, disk storage, tape storage, communications devices, e.g., switches, routers, and other components necessary to support the DEERS mid-range processing requirements.  3) Network support for the Government provided circuits, communications devices and other components.  4) Transition of the existing mainframe, mid-range, networks, and other components and processing from the current contractor’s facility to the contractor’s proposed facility in such a manner that the disruption to the DEERS user community is limited to no more than 8 hours.  All equipment is currently housed at EDS’ facility located in Auburn Hills, Michigan.   GSA anticipates a period of performance of 18-months for transition and one six-month option for testing.   All interesting parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence that your firm has previous experience in processing over 2 million queries daily against a population of over 20 million individuals, operating both a COCO legacy system and a GOCO modern system and possess a facility that has ISO 9001 Certification and is in compliance with DoD security requirements.  The offeror must describe at least two similar projects that their firm has worked which are similar in scope and their outcome and at least one customer reference POC with telephone number for these projects.

This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it a formal Request for Proposals. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determing whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on 1 October 2002. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 14 Jun 02. The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($18 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 1 Sep 02, with a performance start date of 1 Oct 02.The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>The General Services Administration anticipates the need for future appraisal services to assist in the restructuring program of the government-owned inventory of real estate assets.  GSA’s portfolio restructuring activities are managed by the Office of Portfolio Management located in GSA’s Central Office.  Numerous contracts are being established to provide timely, cost effective, and professional appraisal, appraisal related, and consulting services with optimum geographic coverage in the United States and U.S. Territories.  A General State Certification in the corresponding state or territory of interest is a prerequisite for a proposal to be considered (temporary certifications, or reciprocal arrangements between states are acceptable).  Real estate appraisal, appraisal related, and consulting services are potentially needed for a wide variety of property types including special purpose properties.  These properties may include large tracts of vacant land (urban and rural), office buildings, warehouses, industrial, commercial, retail, courthouses, post offices, federal office buildings, hospitals, large housing complexes, golf courses, historic properties, military installations, aviation-related facilities, defense manufacturing plants, complex industrial facilities, partial interests, and other properties that are unique / complex in nature.  Demonstration of adequate appraisal experience and education will be essential.  The maximum contract limitation for each contract is $500,000 for each 2-year period.  The anticipated initial contract period is from September 1, 2003, through August 31, 2005, with three subsequent 2-year renewable option periods.  These contracts are set aside exclusively for small business (under NAICS Code 531320).  The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about July 18, 2003 and proposals will be due 30 days after issuance.  Copies of the solicitation may be obtained electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services are required for the construction of the new United States Courthouse located in the central business district of Rockford, IL.  The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and a unilateral Option for Construction Phase Services.  A Firm, Fixed-Price Incentive contract is contemplated.  The CMc?s price for Pre-construction Phase Services will form the base contract and Construction Phase Services will be evaluated as an Option.  The Option pricing will be broken down into the following categories: Construction Management (lump sum); General Construction (not-to-exceed price); profit, overhead, and daily delay rates; subcontractor commission; and general conditions.  These Option prices will be evaluated prior to the selection of the CMc; but,  before the Option is exercised, a firm, fixed price will be negotiated for the General Construction services based on the finalized design documents.  If the CMc and the Government cannot agree on a fixed price for the General Construction Services, the entire Option will not be exercised and the Construction Phase Services will be competitively bid on the open market.
Project Summary:  For the construction portion of this project, the General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to construct a 150,000 gross square foot Federal Courthouse that will house the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Marshal Service and the U. S. Attorney as the major tenants, as well as 55 indoor parking spaces.  The Courthouse will be constructed to meet the 10-year need of the Court and Court-related agencies with a building and site able to accommodate their 30-year expansion requirements.  The new Courthouse will contain five Courtrooms (1 District, 1 Ceremonial, 1 magistrate and 2 Bankruptcy).  The estimated cost of construction is approximately $35-45 million (this amount does not include Pre-construction Phase Services), with a construction duration of approximately 30 months.  Currently funds are available for the base contract, but are not available for the construction Option.  Selection of the CMc?type firm will be in accordance with the FAR Part 15 Source Selection Procedures and the Best Value Trade-off process.  All elements of work to be executed must be within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation. 
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor.  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, tracking costs associated with warm/lit shell and tenant improvements, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the beginning of the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc  (also known as AGS Document 565) and the Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor.
Proposal Submission Requirements.  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection Best Value Process.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board in order to narrow the field to a competitive range of the most qualified firms.  These firms will then be invited to deliver an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, IL.  After these presentations, prices from the Offerors still in the competitive range will be considered.  A Best Value Trade-off process will determine which offer is in the best interests of the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without conducting negotiations.
Contract Award.  The base contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Pre-construction Phase services.  Option prices will be accepted for Construction Phase services at the time of the base contract award, but will be negotiated once design documents are completed.
Technical Evaluation Factors.  
For the purposes of evaluation, similar projects are defined as construction of new buildings with a complex program, a size of approximately 100,000 gross square feet or more, and an estimated construction cost in excess of $25,000,000.00.  Contractors that cannot meet all minimum requirements of the evaluation factors are not advised to avoid submitting an offer.  Points can still be earned for factors where not all aspects of the standard for evaluation are met, but Offerors should consider the extent to which their shortcomings would affect their overall scores, and thereby their chances of being included in the competitive range.  The following evaluation factors are in descending order of importance.  1.  Experience Providing Pre-construction, Construction Management, and General Construction Services on Similar Projects.  For this factor, Offerors shall submit up to six (6) similar projects completed in the last five (5) years, where the Offeror performed as CMc, CM at Risk, or as a traditional General Contractor.  Two projects should demonstrate the Offeror?s experience providing Pre-construction Services, two should demonstrate experience as a Construction Manager and two should demonstrate experience as a General Contractor.  It is acceptable for Offerors to submit the same two projects as examples under each of the three categories, but no more than six projects will be evaluated overall.  2. Past Performance Providing Pre-construction, Construction Management and General Construction Services on Similar Projects.  For this factor, Offerors shall submit references for each of the projects submitted under Evaluation Factor Number 1 that demonstrate satisfactory performance based on responses to GSA?s Past Performance Questionnaire.  3. Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.  This factor evaluates the experience and qualifications of key team members and their availability and responsibility to the proposed project  4. Project Management Plan.  This factor evaluates the Offeror?s methods and means to ensure successful completion of the project on time, on budget, and within quality expectations, as well as subcontracting goals.

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a Simplified Acquisition to Veridian Systems Division, 1400 Key Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209, on a sole source basis. The order is for Obstacle Detection Phenomenology (ODP) Analysis of data multi-sensor data. Veridian recently conducted the spectral image data collections under the ODP program, Contract number (N61331-02-C-0040) and organized and archived all of the data (Veridian Electronic ODP Data Archive 200150-3-T, May 2003), which is required to be updated for this work.  Veridian is directly familiar with the sensors used to collect the ODP data and the theory, methods, and procedures for data reduction.  The IR imagery in the ODP archive has been partially reduced from its raw data using chromotomographic sensors into radiance data hypercubes.  Veridian understands how to complete the full reduction of the data to the proper units needed for insertion into state-of-the-art modeling and simulation tools.  Veridian has developed and is directly familiar with the HYSIM_v2 / MODTRAN4 spectral modeling and simulation tools.  IR image data must be properly prepared for insertion into these currently operating tools, and other modeling tools, for use on other planned obstacle data analysis tasks. Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code is 541710. PSC is AD94. Size Standard is 500 Employees

Input all the information collected during the six-month visit into the LAM database.  The medical information is collected by physician, nurses, and other disciplines involved in patient care.  The data in the medical records, may contain LAM patient identifying information, patient profile, medical history management, and clinical research.  This information is transcribed by the contractor into a computerized database.  The Database Design is the customized database designed by the contractor for the LAM disease, which includes tables, relationships, queries and melding of the existing PCCMB patient database.  The objective of this requirement is to maintain, modify and update the LAM Database based on relevant clinical information.  The period of performance is twelve (12) months from the date of the award of the contract.  The Contractor shall submit weekly reports outlining the progress to date.  Also, Interim reports requested by the Branch Chief shall be submitted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health,  intends to negotiate with Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica located in Merelos, Mexico, to issue a modification to contract number N01-ES-15467 entitled "Effect of the Antiandrogen Measures at Birth" on a sole source basis. The purpose of the modification is to conduct a follow-up study to assess duration of breast feeding and other outcomes.  Specifically, the Contractor shall (1) hire and train a scientific team (study staff) that shall locate, enroll, and study women and their children in their homes, according to a prescribed study schedule. (2) enter into computer files data obtained by the questionnaire and antropometric measurement. (3) analyze a stored serum specimen from about 500 mothers for DDE and related compounds. (4) collaborate with NIEHS scientists in writing scientific reports on the project for publication in peer-reviewed journals. (5) move one aliquot of maternal serum for each subject to the NIEHS specimen repository for long-term storage.  It is the Government's estimate that this additional work will require an additional two years to perform. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1) FAR 66.302-1(b)(1) The current contractor is in a unique position to analyze blood specimens from all the women enrolled in the original study.  The effect of DDE on lactation can be done without having to obtain new biologic specimens from subjects.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government   makes competition unfeasible.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

 MARKET VALUE:  $40,044 - $52,058

I. POSITION DESCRIPTION

INTRODUCTION

OTI was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:  http://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/oti/ 

POSITION OVERVIEW

The incumbent serves as a Travel and Voucher Specialist reporting to the Management  Team Leader in the Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI).  Within DCHA/OTI, he/she has sole responsibility for managing and coordinating travel, payroll and miscellaneous reimbursement activities for OTI program-funded staff worldwide.  

For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI USPSC staff are deployed expeditiously, often with little or no lead time.  The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail and able to handle multi-tasking.  This is key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations.  It is essential that OTI personnel receive prompt salary payments and that their travel arrangements are handled expeditiously.  To achieve this, OTI requires a Travel and Voucher Specialist who has the capacity to act independently and proactively anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

&#61607; Prepare travel authorizations for assignment, separation, invitational, temporary duty, and other official travel in accordance with the Agency's Travel Regulations. Obtain appropriate clearances and signatures and assure appropriate accounting data information is included on all Travel Authorizations (TAs). Process applications and renewals for Diplomatic and Official passports for OTI staff and facilitate obtaining required visas and country clearances.  Coordinate with the traveler and with the USAID travel agent (SATO)to provide the traveler with a travel authorization, ticket, travel voucher package, etc.

&#61607; Prepare and/or process Time and Attendance reports, salary vouchers and contract expenses for the PSCs in the field and in OTI/W.  Process travel vouchers for payment.  Amend travel authorizations as required to upward adjust funds obligated. Assist OTI staff with resolution of problems related to salary, reimbursements and time and attendance. 

A conservative estimate of TAs and travel vouchers prepared and processed through NMS and Travel Manager is 120 - 150 of each (240 – 300 total), not counting TAs that are charged to individual PSC contracts.  That could be another 20 – 30 (40 – 60 total).  In support of the 48 USPSCs employed by OTI in Washington and overseas, a minimum of 1,248 salary vouchers are processed each year, not counting miscellaneous vouchers submitted for other contract expenses.
 
&#61607; Maintain accurate records and log of vouchers sent to the Office of Financial Management (M/FM).  Follow-up with M/FM to ensure payments are made in a timely manner, problems are resolved with minimal delay and that M/FM has the correct mailing address for confirmation of salary and leave balance purposes.

&#61607; Provide program support by assisting with the maintenance of program and grant files and updating the documentation on specific OTI programs as required.  Serves as alternate Records Management Liaison Officer for maintenance and disposition of program/activity/project files. 

&#61607; Review and route vouchers from vendors (Contracts, IQC contracts, Cooperative Agreements, Grants and Purchase Orders) for services, commodities and equipment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.  Verify accounting information and availability of funds prior to sending invoices to the appropriate Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for administrative approval.  

Monthly vouchers from our large IQC contracts range from $500,000 to in excess of $1.3 million. However, we do process a large number of smaller vouchers for vendors under other procurement mechanisms.  These vouchers can range from $2,000 up to $500,000.

&#61607; Assist USPSC staff by answering phones, typing correspondence, cables and arranging meetings as requested by the Management Team Leader;

&#61607; Provide advice, guidance and instruction to new personnel prior to departure to the field to ensure appropriate forms are completed correctly related to cash advances, signed public vouchers, tax forms, direct deposit forms and timely  completion of travel vouchers to liquidate outstanding advances in the Controller's Office.

&#61607; Provide guidance and information to OTI staff assigned overseas with regard to the process for packing, shipping and storage of household effects (HHE), personal effects and Unaccompanied Air Baggage (UAB).  Assist employees with the resolution of problems relating to the transportation and storage of effects.

&#61607; Expedite the flow of programmatic and other documents through the clearance processes.  This will involve assisting country Program Managers with the processing of data into the New Management System (NMS).

&#61607; Establish and maintain effective and productive working relationships with administrative and financial personnel in USAID Missions, M/FM, regional financial management service centers, USAID Travel Office (M/AS/TT) and the Agency’s Travel Agent (SATO) to facilitate the timely processing of requests and resolution of problems encountered.

&#61607; Responsible for tracking and recovery of outstanding travel advances and monitoring voucher reimbursements to identify deobligation of funds opportunities.  Report regularly to the Financial Management Specialist on the status of these activities.

DHS SPIRIT acquisition milestones have been revised as follows:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be released in late 4th Quarter FY03 with proposals due in mid 1st Quarter FY04.  Contracts are anticipated to be awarded in 3rd Quarter FY04.  The Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) will be used to retrieve offerors annual Representations and Certifications (Section K of the RFP) for this acquisition.  An abridged Section K will be included in the solicitation for contract-specific and/or agency-specific Representations and Certifications, if applicable.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of the contract is expected to begin on 1 October 2002. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 26 Jun 02. The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET). The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 1 Sep 02, with a performance start date of 1 Oct 02.The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Intelligent Passport with embedded Integrated Circuit (IC)
<SOLNBR>RFI-CA-0001
<RESPDATE>072803
<ARCHDATE>08122003
<CONTACT>Kathleen Mejia, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038756689, Fax 7038756085, Email mejiakj@state.gov
<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), is soliciting industry input supporting the development/deployment of a new Intelligent Passport that contains an embedded Integrated Circuit (IC). Specifically, this request for information relates to the integration of contactless integrated circuit technology into the traditional paper-based passport booklet document and the ultimate procurement of such technologies. 

	One of the primary driving forces that has led to this requirement is Section 303(c) of the Enhanced Border Security Act and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 which requires, inter alia, that countries that participate in the US Visa Waiver Program have a “…program to issue to its nationals machine readable passports that are tamper–resistant and incorporate biometric and document authentication identifiers that comply with applicable biometric and document identifying standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization.” Consistent with principles of international reciprocity, the United States intends to adhere to these same requirements. Therefore, the use of contactless integrated circuit technology arises as a direct result of standards decisions recently taken by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), announcing on May 28 that “…ICAO…has selected high-capacity, contactless integrated circuit (IC) chips to store identification information in MRTD’s -- passports, visas and identity cards…”. This decision and the related determinations made by ICAO regarding the use of biometrics for travel document applications are reflected in Document 9303, Part 1, the ICAO standards for passports. This RFI relates solely to the requirement for a chip in-lay assembly and for the contactless chip integration. 

	The U.S. intends to carry out the integration of chip technology into passports in several phases of implementation. The first and thereby the most urgent is to be implemented by 26 Oct 2004, which will introduce the biometric-carrying IC to passports issued at a single domestic passport issuance facility.  In parallel, CA will work with the Department of Homeland Security for testing the new passports. The remaining phases of implementation will be carried out more broadly in terms of both issuance as well as inspection, with the ultimate goal of all US passports having IC’s embedded in them.  This request is seeking information regarding all aspects of the contactless chip including, but not limited to chip availability, technical performance, security, durability, delivery scheduling, etc. with respect to carrying out these initiatives. All responses will be kept in strict confidence by the Department of State.
    


 Product Specifications:  
In accordance with ICAO specifications and State Department requirements, the product sought is an ISO/IEC 14443, Part 1-4 compliant, Type A or B, with a minimum storage capacity of 64 K (kilobytes) chip/antenna assembly embedded in an in-lay suitable for incorporation into the paper passport book; on-board operating system in accordance with ISO/IEC Standard 7816-4; the data will be stored on the chip in the Logical Data Structure prescribed by ICAO and secured with a digital signature. The minimum Set of Commands includes: “Select File” by Data File (DF) name (full name) to select the application; “Read Record” by short Elementary File (EF) identifier with a specified record number or with a specified record identifier, to read data group; and, “Write Record” needed to load data group onto the chip; a read distance range of 0-10 cm. (Vendors are asked to comment on the use of READ BINARY either instead of or in addition to READ RECORD as suggested above.) The memory must support random access data retrieval with a data retention capability of 15 years under the conditions of use described in ISO 7816 and will support 106 read/write cycles without failure or performance degradation. The documents are issued for a ten-year period of validity and the chip assembly must meet this requirement in terms of overall durability. Vendor comments regarding durability, flexing, susceptibility to solvents, electrical/magnetic fields, stamping, and the routine use that an international traveler is likely to subject the passport to and ways in which testing and validation can be carried out are particularly sought. The Bureau of Consular Affairs is especially eager to receive as much specific information regarding durability definitions and related testing and the meaning of test results in terms of chip expectations when integrated into a passport book. 

The chip will carry data relative to the authorized bearer of the passport. Specifically, the chip will hold the biographic information similar to that in the current visual and machine readable zones such as name, issuance authority, date and place of birth and so on. Additionally, to carry out the ICAO requirement for a globally interoperable biometric, the chip will hold at least one compressed full facial image of the authorized document bearer, such image of at least 12K. It should be noted that although the ICAO minimum standard for chip size is 32K, the State Department desires a minimum chip size of 64K; vendors should comment on the impact of 32K vice 64K, if any.  Also, vendors should comment on the usable storage in a 64K chip. Other similar storage requirements may emerge as plans progress. Security of data and protection of privacy are critical considerations. In addition to the ICAO-recommended use of encryption and digital signing, the Bureau of Consular Affairs is interested in suggestions and recommendations from vendors to address these concerns. Similarly, facilitation of the traveler is a corollary objective along with enhanced security. Therefore, the performance variables associated with transmission speeds and data transfer rates should be addressed clearly and comprehensively.  The intelligent passport must be readable on a globally interoperable environment. 





As a guiding principle, vendors should keep in mind that incorporation of the IC into the document should be accomplished with as little impact on current operations as possible.  There are three systems that together constitute the overall concept of operations for the U. S.  passport production. The first two systems are within the purview of the Department of State as issuer and the US Government Printing Office as the book “manufacturer”.
With respect to the personalization function of the Department of State, the use of the Toppan MP300US printer is intended to continue. The use of the chip and the incorporation of the inlay in the book must intersect with this process as transparently as possible and without any impact on the ability to print data into the passport.  It is intended that the chip assembly/inlay will be incorporated into the inside back cover of the book at GPO, with as little impact on these processes as possible as well.  Writing to the chip may be accomplished as a part of the personalization process (assuming appropriate changes can be made to the Toppan printer) or as a separate step.  The susceptibility of the assembly/inlay to temperature variables, flexing, bending, etc. are important for the vendor to address. (Vendor views as to chip/book placement methodologies are welcome.)  Finally, the inspection of documents, generally carried out at the world’s ports of entries, is the third systemic area of focus that the vendor should address in responding. Keep in mind that the inspection of U.S. passports will vary all over the world and passports will be subject to manual, machine-reading and unattended examination. Readers will vary in many ways, although ICAO has recommended that ISO Standard 14443 both A and B capable be used. The inspection authorities will also likely be equipped to read the OCR-B as at present as well as the features that full-page readers can carry out. The chip assembly’s performance variables should be addressed in this inspection context. (The Attachment expands on specifications.)   

Information Requested:  

Vendors are requested to provide information on all of the above factors, and to respond to all elements, i.e. 1) technical performance, 2) security, 3) durability and 4) other factors that are relevant to the success of this project.   It is requested that vendors provide a not-to-exceed 3-page summary of their response, and then attach additional information as appropriate. Any assumptions made regarding any of the systems within the concept of operations should be clearly stated. This covers book manufacturing, passport personalization, and inspection at ports of entry. Any known or anticipated impediments/constraints affecting the plans as outlined should be addressed forthrightly and candidly. Insofar as pricing, general cost estimates should be provided for both the relatively limited early stages of implementation as well as full nationwide volume. There are approximately 7 million passports issued, with the intent being that by 2006 all US passports will be IC-enhanced. Please note as well that policy options under consideration related to the US passport could well increase annual passport issuance to the range of 12 million or higher.  The information provided must also cover integration requirements in general as to the systems specified as well as those that may be chip/inlay-specific. The response should also include a schedule for delivery, milestones related thereto, dependencies or caveats in such scheduling, and manufacturing capacity/flexibility with regard to both small quantities early in implementation and higher quantities as volume reaches maximum.  
In addition to the required information above, if the respondent has any information regarding health and safety concerns with respect to the use of contactless chips, such information will be desirable. Additionally, with regard to global interoperability, views will be appreciated regarding any issues or potential impacts created by the differences in legal radiation requirements and limits that are due to regulatory policies among Europe, Japan, the United States and others.


Time To Respond:  

Questions should be e-mailed to chiprfi@state.gov, and the Government will respond as soon as practicable to all companies on the mailing list.   Responses must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM EST July 28, 2003.     Responses should sent to e-mail address chiprfi@state.gov , or mailed to the following address:

<SUBJECT>L -- Office of Rural Health Policy Technical Assistance Services
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis,  the National Rural Health Association(NRHA), Kansas City, Missouri.  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  A one(1) year contract is planned.    

The NRHA is a national membership organization, whose mission is to improve the health and health care of rural Americans and to provide leadership on rural issues through 1) advocacy, 2) communications, 3) education and 4) research.  The NRHA is uniquely capable of providing these four necessary skills areas along with the pre-existing organizational relationships with State Rural Health Associations(SRHA) and State Offices of Rural Health(SORH.)  This combination makes the NHRA the only organization that can immediately provide meaningful technical assistance to a wide range of rural stakeholders and fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Award of a contract to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government since that organization would need to attain the necessary skills, capabilities, and organizational relationships needed for this requirement.  This is not a solicitation but an announcement of the Government’s intent to contract.  

The purpose of this contract is to provide technical assistance to the SRHAs and the SORHs as these organizations continue their efforts to provide and improve health care services for rural Americans.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Site Monitoring Project [Request for Capability Statements]
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to negotiate with Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), Unique Capabilities, for a modification to increase the volume of activity under Contract N01-AI-05405 through the completion of the existing contract that ends 06/30/2005.  This contract was awarded under a full-and-open competition under SIC C ode 8741; Size Standard $5 Million, for the period 07/01/2000 through 06/30/2005.  As the sponsor of federally funded clinical trials research, DAIDS has an on-going regulatory responsibility for oversight of some 200 studies conducted at over 800 sites in 41 countries, and PPD has assumed a significant part of this responsibility through the contract.  PPD currently provides domestic and international on-site monitoring and training services for the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the Acute Infection Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), and a large non-network trial - ESPRIT.  In responding to the scientific priorities of the evolving HIV/AIDS epidemic larger and more complex studies have been implemented at more sites than originally planned.  These new sites are both domestic and in resource poor settings in the developing world that require the same level of monitoring and training as currently provided by the contract.  The negotiated modification will provide for an increase in the activity itself to continue to provide support to the on-going clinical trial monitoring and training operations of DAIDS’ Clinical Site Monitoring Project.  PPD is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance under the current contract.  If this portion of PPD’s requirement were awarded to another contractor at this time, the consequences would mean an interruption and/or inconsistency in the normal monitoring operations of DAIDS.  Therefore, no other service will satisfy Agency requirements. If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort.  You are directed to Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

Statement of Work Islamic Services Life Connections Program

A. BACKGROUND
In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi faith Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program. This is a voluntary program which will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.

The program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program’s design will increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.

The program will enlist partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.

The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

B.	SUBJECT:
Provide a Jewish Spiritual Leader who will provide religious instruction and leadership for Jewish inmates participating in the Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Michigan.

The contractor will also provide leadership in weekly Torah studies and may be required to lead some Jewish services based on program needs. The schedule may include some weekend and/or evening sessions based on program needs. The breakdown of sessions will be determined locally.

A session is defined as a two (2) hour block of time.   Partial sessions are not authorized, nor will they be reimbursed.  The contractor will not include lunch breaks, travel time, security reasons or other issues as part of a session.  The Contractor will not attend institution or department functions.

E.	SUPPLIES:
All supplies that the contractor may routinely need will be provided by the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Michigan. These supplies will normally include any materials needed to perform the services covered under this contract. The contractor will pay for their own expenses to attend one planning meeting each year related to the development of the program. The site for this meeting will be determined at a later date.

F.	METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:
The contractor will provide religious instruction based on their own expertise as it relates to the core curriculum materials. The contractor will work closely with the Chaplain Program Manager and other program staff to assist in the development of the program and to gauge the progress of individual participants. Consultations will be held with Life Connections Chaplain Program Manager as needed. Although the instruction will follow the tenants of Orthodox Judaism the contractor may work with participants who follow other faiths or other interpretations of Judaism.

G. MANAGEMENT:
The contractor will be monitored by the Life Connections Chaplain Program Manager. The contractor will attend all training required by the Bureau of Prisons for contract workers. The contractor will not be permitted to attend institution meetings, staff recalls, or government training sessions for institution staff on contract time or as a consideration of the contract.

The contractor may attend team meetings, departmental meetings, or other meetings relating to the involvement of the services to be provided by terms of the contract. Some meetings will be required and accomplished on contract time.

The background checks are outlined in the section entitled contract security.  The list is subject to change at any time.

The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation.  

The resulting contract is not a personnel appointment; therefore, payment is based on the provision of an end product or the accomplishment of a specific service.  The resulting contract does not constitute an employee/employer relationship; therefore, the  contractor will not be subject to government supervision, except for security related matters.

<SUBJECT>T -- Mail Services and Returned Peace Corps Volunteer  (RPCV) Contact Database Updating
<SOLNBR>PC-03-R-002
<RESPDATE>071803
<ARCHDATE>08022003
<CONTACT>Jean Bioni, Lead Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 692-1973, Fax (202) 692-1621, Email jbioni@peacecorps.gov
<DESC>The Peace Corps is seeking to outsource large mailings addressed to Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs), often to more than 100,000 recipients, and the contact database maintenance necessary for these mailings.

After each large mailing we have sent out over the past year and a half, more than 10,000 pieces of undeliverable mail have been returned to us with either forwarding address labels from the U.S. Postal Service, notification of the death of the RPCV, or indication of an invalid address.  Currently Peace Corps staff enter this information from returned mail into our internal Volunteer database.  However we would like to focus our personnel resources elsewhere and outsource this database maintenance and have a contractor perform the work using their own facilities. 

Ideally we would like to contract out this returned mail data cleanup in conjunction with the printing and a match mailing (to include inserting, labeling and posting) for all future large mailings to RPCVs.  We would like to have any returned mail go directly back to the vendor, possibly via a P.O. Box in Peace Corps’ name, for immediate processing of address change or other information.  (Peace Corps is also interested in obtaining telephone numbers, email addresses, and notices of death from sources other than RPCV families if these are possible options.)

Presently, there are approximately 10,000 pieces of returned mail stored in the Peace Corps Headquarters building to be processed. This was undeliverable mail from the RPCV newsletter that was sent out in the winter of 2003.  Additionally, there are a number of large mailings scheduled to go out this year.  

The current returned mail in the building has only a name as an identifier for each Returned Peace Corps Volunteer on the mailing label.  However for future mailings we have decided to include a Volunteer ID (different from SSN) on the mailing label to make it easier for the vendor to identify an individual to compare against a "snapshot" file of the database that Peace Corps will send them.


SCOPE OF WORK

Peace Corps anticipates awarding this contract on or before July 31, 2003.

Peace Corps requires the proposal to include:
1.	A description of the methodology by which the contractor will prepare Peace Corps mailings; process undeliverable mail, death notices, Postal updates, and business reply mail; and provide the necessary reports and updated files for uploading into the Peace Corps database.
2.	A proposed timeline to complete each, from the date of receipt of mailer documents and the mailing list from Peace Corps, to the date the file and report of final updates to the mailing list (and on occasion reply mail file updates) are sent to Peace Corps.
3.	A list of references with telephone numbers and email addresses, including current clients who receive similar services.

The purpose of this contract is to increase the speed and efficiency of our mailings and database update processes in order to ensure that our mailings reach RPCVs.  We also expect to reduce the postage costs due to misdirected mail, as well as the costs of using Peace Corps resources to update the mailing list in-house.  Ultimately, our goal is to reach all RPCVs with our mail communications by keeping their contact information current in our systems.

Peace Corps wishes to enter into an indefinite delivery contract with a strict non-disclosure clause to protect the privacy of the Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs).  

We request estimated pricing for handling the undeliverable mail for each large mailing from our database of over 138,000 RPCVs, starting with the processing of approximately 10,000 returned mail items (with name identifiers only) which we currently have stored in the Headquarters building in Washington, DC.  General pricing should include data entry for any reply mail with information updates, corrections from the U.S. Postal Service, and any general file clean up that might be required.  We plan to contract for a minimum of two mailings and a maximum of fifteen mailings in this indefinite delivery contract.

Please provide estimated pricing for:

1.	Undeliverable mail items already received with name identifiers on label (RPCV Newsletter – 1st issue, approximately 10,000 undeliverable items stored at HQ)

2.	Total cost, from printing to return item processing, of future mailings (which will include a unique RPCV identifier on each label).  Undeliverable items from these mailings will be returned directly to the vendor for list updating and/or forwarding to new addresses.  (Peace Corps will provide samples of three typical mailings to base costs on, including an RPCV Newsletter, a Peace Corps Day Mailing, and a Close of Service Certificate with its accompanying letter.)


MATERIALS AND ACCESS SUPPLIED TO CONTRACTOR FOR USE IN THIS PROJECT

·	File types possible:  ASCII comma delimited or tab delimited text files.

·	Peace Corps personnel for coordination:  Pat Walker (ASD/Office of the CIO), Susan Bloomer (Printing Officer/Office of the Director), and Mary Stark (Domestic Programs).


DELIVERABLES AND TIME FRAME

Required Deliverables

We require that the contractor handle the entire cycle of the mailing, from printing, inserting, labeling, and sending mail; data entry for undeliverable for RPCV contact list updating (reporting the number, type, and source of changes to RPCV records); the inputting of responses to reply mail into a specifically provided file; when feasible, the resending of mail items to recently updated addresses; and any other procedures involved in managing all outgoing mailings from the agency under this contract.   We wish to have the mailings returned directly to the mail services contractor, possibly via a Peace Corps Post Office Box or another more favorable solution provided by the contractor.  

RESPONSIBILITIES AND LOGISTICS

Task Timeline:
Task	Time to Completion(Note:  time frames are negotiable.)
1.  Print, insert, label, and send mailings.	Please propose a reasonable time frame based on samples provided.
2.  Receive and process undeliverable mail by updating records with either a new address or by noting in the field provided if the address is not valid, or that the RPCV is deceased, if that information is included in the communication.  	Please propose a reasonable time frame based on samples provided.
3.  Update any returned business reply mail data into a Peace Corps-provided file.  A separate file with a report of records and fields processed will be required to be submitted weekly for up to six months from mail date, ending with a cumulative report at the end of month six.	Beginning one week from date of mailing and continuing weekly for up to six months for reply mail.
4.  Return an updated file to Peace Corps weekly, with a report on the number of records changed, the sources of information for these changes, and the last date of update provided by the source for each record.  The final file submitted in week eight should include a cumulative report on all records processed.	Beginning one week from date of mailing and continuing for eight weeks for undeliverable mail.  



REFERENCES

Please include a list of a minimum of three (3) references with telephone numbers and email addresses, including current clients who receive similar services.


ORAL PRESENTATIONS:  may be required.


TYPE OF CONTRACT:   Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ); Firm-fixed Price


PROPOSAL SUBMISSION :  Please submit 2 copies of both a technical and cost proposal.

POSITION TITLE:		Private Sector Legal and Institutional Development Advisor

MARKET VALUE: The market value for this PSC is equivalent to a GS-14 level.  The salary range for a GS-14 level is $72,381.00 to $94,098.00. In addition, the Mission has 10% Post Differential rate and a 20% danger pay rate. The salary will be determined based on past salary history and experience of the successful candidate within the above mentioned salary range.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an essential element of the U.S. Government's role in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.   USAID assistance supports U.S. interests in promoting regional stability, economic prosperity and adherence to democratic principles, and is designed to put the fundamentals in place for long-term, sustainable development.  

SCOPE OF WORK

During the term of the contract the private enterprise development advisor will collaborate closely with senior level counterparts in the Ministry of National Economy, including at the Ministerial level, as well as the private sector, other donors and institutional contractors in advancing the emergence of a competitive, export-oriented private enterprise sector through institutional development of public and private sector entities impacting the private sector.  This advisor will serve as a senior advisor within USAID/West Bank and Gaza on economic reform and institutional development issues and will manage selected initiatives in this area.  In addition, he/she is likely to manage one or two other activities in the area of market or financial access.  

Basic Functions:
USAID/West Bank & Gaza requires a U.S. personal services contractor to: (a) oversee the management of a $15.5 million contract dealing with financial markets reform (b) support a highly visible, $4 million contract providing audit capacity and oversight for the Palestinian Ministry of Finance and other ministries (c) serve as the locus for USAID’s participation in the multi-donor Market Reform Support Group; and (d) design and manage one or more new initiatives in the reform or business revitalization area.

An understanding of both bank and non-bank financial institutions is required. 
•	Oversee a contract providing audit oversight to the Palestinian Ministry of Finance and other Palestinian instrumentalities.  The contractor will interface with not only the Palestinian Ministry of Finance but the Israeli Ministry of Finance, and the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, given the high visibility of this activity.

•	Assess longer-term Palestinian needs for regulatory and institutional development as it relates to trade and industrial development;
•	Develop options for future USAID assistance, including strategic vision, estimated funding requirements and implementation mechanisms;

•	Ability to work independently and as a member of a team, consulting with other staff and host country officials to ensure accountability and achievement of objectives in specified timeframes is necessary.  Ability to assume leadership role, when necessary.

•	Capacity and experience in working with a broad range of local public and private sector individuals, other donors, NGO’s and partners that are relevant to USAID objectives.

•	Understanding and appreciation of USAID goals and State/USAID interface in implementing the economic assistance program in the West Bank & Gaza.

•	Proven oral and representational skills with government departments, private sector organizations and NGOs on technical or program issues involving policy and non-policy matters.

Statement of Work

Veterans History Project - Radio Outreach
			

Background

In keeping with the Library of Congress policy of public outreach and sharing of collections, the Veterans History Project (VHP) of the American Folklife Center (AFC) at the Library of Congress is seeking to highlight its audio collections through radio outlets.   The goal of the outreach is both to make the Library’s VHP collections known, and as a result attract further materials to the Veterans History Project.  In particular, the Congressionally mandated VHP seeks to make the Project known to veterans and affiliated civilians throughout the country, as well as to individuals and groups interested in interviewing them.

Scope

The Veterans History Project is planning a radio series featuring the VHP collections.  VHP has approached PRI, a prestigious radio outlet, for a possible radio presentation.  Also, VHP’s founding corporate sponsor, AARP, has its own radio outlets, a natural venue for featuring VHP’s collections. 

The contractor shall work within the confines of a mutually agreed-upon concept to produce a multi-part series featuring the VHP collections.
