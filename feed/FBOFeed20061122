<CONTACT>ANN CAPRON CONTRACTING OFFICER 3034452429     acapron@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>Reclamation is pursuing various remediation options to correct identified seismic deficiencies with Mormon Island Auxiliary Dike (MIAD), Folsom Dam, in Sacramento, California.  One option being considered is in situ treatment of deep foundation soils along the downstream portion of the embankment using jet grouting.  These foundation soils consist primarily of dredger tailings.  A jet grouting test section will be required in order to develop final design jet grouting parameters and to determine if jet grouting is technically and economically feasible at this site. The contractor will be required to have specific experience and knowledge of jet grouting principles (including specific experience with triple and double-fluid jet grouting systems), previous jet grouting projects, technical requirements and limitations of jet grouting, geotechnical engineering principles, and seismic analysis techniques.  The contractor is required to complete a review of Reclamation's proposed jet grouting test section design and specifications and provide guidance on the design prior to the contract award.  The contractor will also be required to be on site during the test section construction to assist Reclamation staff and gather data for evaluation of the test section results.  The contractor will be required to write a report of the results of the test section.  The contractor shall be an acknowledged expert in the field of jet grouting and jet grouting technology.  The contractor should have specific and significant broad experience with jet grouting technology, jet grouting field applications, and jet grouting theory.  In particular the contractor shall have specific knowledge of the broad types of foundation conditions that are applicable to jet grouting including limitations to the technology such as depth, material types, groundwater levels, column diameter, and specific experience with jet grouting technologies such as single, double, and triple phase systems and both conventional and large-diameter columns.  The contractor shall have field experience with at least 10 major jet grouting contracts that have been completed in the last 5 years and shall have experience serving as a jet grouting consultant.  The contractor shall also have knowledge of geotechnical engineering principals and geology.  The contractor will perform the majority of the work in contractor facilities with the exception of the on site work during the test section construction at Mormon Island Auxiliary Dike located in Folsom, California, which is anticipated to last approximately 3 weeks.  The period of performance for this work is from date of award through approximately April 6, 2007.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Laboratory Services  for Tuberculosis Control Activities in the US affiliated Pacific Island Jurisdictions
<SOLNBR>2007-N-09182
<CONTACT>Gloria Sanders, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-639-6025, Fax 404-639-8095, Email GSanders@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates an award for laboratory services for Tuberculosis Control Activities in the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Island Jurisdictions (USAPI).  The project objective is to provide support to implement the laboratory component in the National TB Program from Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory (CLIA)-approved laboratories which address the components specific to the USAPI.  TB laboratory resources are not readily available in the USAPI therefore creating a barrier for CDC to ensure full implementation of an effective TB control program.  In addition, without effective TB laboratory services, CDC is unable to ensure the provision of timely laboratory and medical consultation as well as program technical assistance.  Currently, the infrastructure and resources in the USAPI cannot support the TB laboratory needs promulgated by CDC.  However, many of the USAPI utilize laboratories located in Hawaii and the U.S. mainland for their reference laboratory service needs.  This effort seeks to expand this existing method to support TB laboratory activities and enable CDC to complete its agenda.  CDC seeks to secure services to provide TB laboratory testing, technical assistance and training for the USAPI and to implement a regional TB quality assurance plan.  The period of performance will be 12 months with 2 option years for a total of 36 months.

The minimum qualifications for the offerors are  (1) offeror must already function as Biosafety Level 3 lab, have infection control program, and is compliant with recommended biosafety practices and facility design as indicated by CDC. See criteria for biosafety level 3 laboratory or BSL 3 laboratory at http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl4/bmbl4s3.htm. (2) offeror is 
CLIA laboratory certified and can provide evidence of current CLIA certification and (3) offeror is  International Air Transportation Association (IATA) trained and certified and can provide evidence of successful completion of IATA approved training for the transportation of dangerous goods (infectious substances and diagnostic specimens) and produce proper shipping, importation, exportation permits for infectious and diagnostic specimens. See www.iata.org.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 621511 ? Medical Laboratories.  CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number 2007-N-09182 will be available on or about 15 days from the date of this pre-solicitation notice.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after posting of the RFP.  All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via email to GSanders@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at fedbizopps website for downloading when issued.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB).  A predecessor contract, #DTFA03-00-D-00022, Delivery Order 0002, was originally awarded to a SEDB firm.  The FAA has an ongoing need for some, but not all, of the tasks that were in this order.  This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to SEDBs.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. The North American Industry Code Standard for the work comtemplated is 541330, Engineering Services.  The size standard is $4.5 million. A draft Statement of Work for Airport Facilities Terminal Integration Laboratory (AFTIL) support services is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next five years. Interested companies are required to provide: -A copy of a letter from the Small Business Administratin certifying their status as a SEDB/8(a) firm. -Completed Business Declaration Form, (attached) -A capability summary of not more than 8 pages that addresses corporate capabilities specific to accomplish this work and transition of existing contract in a seamless manner.  The summary should include information on how contractor personnel will be supplied, i.e., currently available as employees of the prime, subcontractor arrangements, etc. Submission of these items is requested by 2 p.m. local time on December 6, 2006.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so no solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for SEDBs is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from completition since the competition may be released to qualified, responding SEDBs. Inquiries relative to this announcement are to be submitted in writing only via e-mail to Phyliss.Schlegel @faa.gov.

<SUBJECT>F--Office of Subsistence Management, Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program, Request for Proposals for projects to begin in 2008.

<ARCHDATE>11222007
<CONTACT>Gary Goldberg Contracting Officer 9077863408     gary_goldberg@fws.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Subsistence Management, administers the Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program.  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program (FRMP) is seeking technically sound projects that gather information to manage and conserve subsistence fishery resources in Alaska.  The program also develops fisheries management expertise within Alaska Native and rural organizations and promotes collaboration among Federal, State, Alaska Native and local organizations.  The Fisheries Resource Monitoring Program encompasses awards made through both Federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This Request for Proposals is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  This Request for Proposals # 701817R015 is simultaneously posted on http://www.fedbizopps.gov  and  http://www.grants.gov.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will determine the instrument by which successful projects are ultimately funded utilizing the criteria in the Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 to distinguish between financial assistance and procurement. As in past years, studies that gather, analyze, and report information needs for effective subsistence fisheries management on Federal public lands in Alaska (National Wildlife Refuges, National Forests, National Parks and Preserves, National Conservation Areas, National Wild and Scenic River Systems, National Petroleum Reserves, and National Recreation Areas) will be considered. The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) has established guidelines for proposals to successfully compete for funding.  Activities that are outside the scope of the Monitoring Program and will not be considered include: habitat protection, mitigation, restoration, and enhancement; hatchery propagation, restoration, enhancement and supplementation; and contaminant assessment, evaluation, and monitoring.  These important activities are most appropriately addressed by the responsible land management or regulatory agency, not the Monitoring Program.  In addition, projects where the primary objective is capacity building (e.g., science camps, technician training, intern programs), are not eligible for funding under the Monitoring Program.  However, monitoring projects with capacity building as a secondary objective are encouraged, and partnerships/capacity building is one of four ranking criteria used to evaluate proposals.   The Monitoring Program provides $6.25 million annually in funding to support research and monitoring of Federal subsistence fisheries in Alaska.  The funding commitments to multiple year projects influence the amount of funding available each year for new projects.  In 2008, approximately $2.2 million will be available to fund new monitoring and research projects needed to sustain Federal subsistence fisheries for rural Alaskans on Federal lands; remaining funding is obligated to existing projects.   There is no "bidder's list" to get on.  There is no Soliciation Package to Request.  At this time you may visit the following website to download the Solicitation Package, Guidelines for Preparing Proposals, and Priority Information Needs  http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/fisapply.cfm In the event you experience difficulties in accessing or downloading information from http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/fisapply.cfm contact Kathleen Orzechowski at (907) 786-3645 or e-mail to fisheries_resource_monitoring@fws.gov Proposals are to be submitted to the Office of Subsistence Management by January 15, 2007, 4:30 PM Alaska time.  It is the applicant's responsiblity to confirm receipt of your proposal by the Service.

This solicitation is being issued as a result of The General Services Administrations completion an Administrative Support Function (ASF) competitive sourcing study under OMB?s Circular A-76 for the Public Buildings Service and General Management and Administration work performed in the National Capital Region (NCR).    Competitive Sourcing, or the OMB A-76 review process, is part of the President?s Management Agenda.   The process allows an agency to develop a proposal known as the Most Efficient Organization (MEO), which is compared against a theoretical cost of contractor performance known as the Estimated Contract Price.  The result of this competition will allow us to manage administrative support activities more effectively region-wide, as well as ensure that the government and taxpayer alike are getting the most for their money.

The Requirement Document (RD) for this study identified 100 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions whose work was captured in the RD.  Of the 100 positions, 28 were government and 72 were contractors.

On September 8, 2006 it was announced that the Agency Provider Most Efficient Organization (MEO) was the performance decision.  The MEO will require 27 Government FTE and 60 contract administrative support positions.  By March 1, 2007 the MEO must be in place.   As a result of the MEO being the performance decision of the study, all GSA National Capital Region's Administrative Support Function contracts were modified to reflect a period of performance not to exceed February 28, 2007, so that the MEO may be implemented by the deadline.

GSA, NCR seeks to establish a multi award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle, thru this solicitation, to satisfy the administrative requirements under the MEO.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award an extension to the Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract N00039-05-C-0013 to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS), 12011 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, VA. from 31 January 2007 through 30 September 2008 (or until Full Rate Production approval for Increment 4.1, whichever occurs sooner).  NGMS will provide the following services up to a Security Level of Top Secret within the Continental United States: 1) Software maintenance and life cycle support (including test support and integration) for the Global Command and Control System  Maritime (GCCS-M) Increment 4.0 and its Common Operating Environment (COE) products through January 2008. Software maintenance includes integration of software upgrades, updates, and preparation of associated documentation; 2) Software development of Increment 4.1 leading to successful completion of Acquisition Milestone Decisions to include Milestone C Approval (MS-C), planned in the 2nd quarter of  2007, Operational Test (OT) of Increment 4.1 in June 2008, and Full Rate Production (FRP) in September 2008.  Past experience has identified that deficiencies recognized during OT will need to be corrected as a condition for full fielding approval.  As the prime developer and integrator of the GCCS-M and the COE products evaluated in the OT, award of a development contract to an alternate vendor would result in an estimated schedule burden of up to one year in the full fielding of Increment 4.1; and 3) Activities performed shall also include reworking the current version of the Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) GCCS-M Increment 4.1 software to permit Government evaluation of reuse potential for Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) per the Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) guidance, to include participation in pilots and exercises; this effort will not include development of additional functionality. Additionally, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, will be conducted for a competitive contract to run concurrent with the extension of N00039-05-C- 0013. The competitive contract anticipated award date is in FY2007 on or around 3rd quarter 2007.  The scope of this competitive contract will include Navy GCCS Family of Systems (FoS) and Navy NECC architecture and design support of all GCCS-M Software Increments post 4.1 FRP, including software development, software and hardware integration, training and life-cycle support, testing, hardware procurement, and installation planning. It will also include training, maintenance and life cycle support, and installation support of all GCCS-M increments. While the Government welcomes responses and questions, the intent of this notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete the extension of N00039-05-C-0013 based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Questions concerning this sole source contract may be directed to mary.ohara@navy.mil or cheryl.fisher@navy.mil.

<DESC>As stated in the October 24, 2006 synopsis regarding the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) NASA, in coordination with the U.S. Geological Survey, plans to issue an RFP for the LDCM Mission Operations Element.  The LDCM Mission Operations Element (MOE) will be used to operate the LDCM observatory from the Mission Operations Center (MOC).  The primary functions of the MOE include command and control, mission planning and scheduling, trending and analysis, and flight dynamics.  The MOE will also perform observatory health and safety monitoring functions, on-board storage management and flight software management.  The draft Mission Operations Element Requirements Document (MOERD) includes more information on the MOE such as draft functional requirements and interfaces.  The draft LDCM Operations Concept Document also provides additional information regarding the operation of the LDCM.  Both of these documents can be accessed on the LDCM website at http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov. In preparation for procurement of the MOE, the LDCM project seeks candidate approaches and information from industry regarding the following topics: 1.	Reference architectures for systems that would meet MOE requirements, including high-level block diagrams/flow charts, general functional descriptions, and physical space requirements.  Include any past experiences at adapting similar mission operations architectures to other spacecraft. Identify any features or processes that minimize the unique development required for this adaptation. 2.	The extent to which Commercial Off-the-Shelf tools and products may be used to meet MOE requirements, areas requiring customization, and the extent of customization needed.  Include any examples of past experiences, previous mission operations systems developed using a COTS/GOTS based approach 3.	Approaches for integration and testing of the MOE with the flight spacecraft/observatory and mission readiness testing with the flight operations team including past experiences, lessons learned, and approaches to reduce risk. 4.	Approaches for the development, conversion, and validation of flight command and telemetry databases, procedures, and displays, when such items are provided by multiple organizations.	Include any past experiences, lessons learned, and recommended approaches to reduce risk. 5.	Feedback regarding the CCSDS Draft Recommendation for Space Data Systems, 660.0-R-2, XML Telemetric & Command Exchange, Red Book, December 2005, and possible application of the draft recommendation or use of common database and style formats for the LDCM flight databases. 6.	Approaches to meeting MOE automation and availability/up-time requirements, including any use of service-oriented architectures.  Related to this, the LDCM project seeks feedback on the use of a Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) or GMSEC-like architecture for the MOE.  Additional information on GMSEC is available at http://gmsec.gsfc.nasa.gov and http://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov. 7.	Feedback on the MOE interface to the LDCM Collection Activity and Planning Element (CAPE).  The principal function of the CAPE is to perform instrument tasking and scheduling as an input to the MOE for command generation.  Feedback should include past experience, lessons learned, and recommended approaches regarding this type of functional interface. 8.	High-level development schedule for the MOE spanning the time from a MOE contract award (authorization to proceed) to launch, showing significant mission integration & test and review milestones, including: a.	MOE PDR and CDR b.	first interface testing with spacecraft c.	delivery to Mission Operations Center (MOC) Schedule should include explanations/descriptions of MOE functionality/ maturity corresponding to each milestone. 9.	Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for full development, integration, testing, deployment, and 5 years of on-orbit sustaining engineering of the LDCM MOE.  The estimate should include any assumptions (e.g. deliverable documents) and should highlight major cost drivers and opportunities for cost savings such as trade offs between development costs for automation and operations costs/staffing. 10.	List any identified risks associated with MOE development, and recommended approaches to reduce/mitigate risk. Please provide written responses to this RFI no later than December 14, 2006.	Concise responses are encouraged and appreciated.  Responses must be submitted to Patricia Dombrowski (Patricia.M.Dombrowski@nasa.gov) or B. Faye Johnson (Betty.F.Johnson@nasa.gov).  Organizations interested in providing responses or additional information in person are requested to schedule a briefing/meeting during the week of January 15, 2007.  Call the LDCM project at 301-286-2053 to schedule an appointment. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=51  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00037.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition requirement.  The NAICS code is 541620, size standard $6.5 million.   Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the environment). As part  of the NAAQS review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an  Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for  NOx and SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and  SOx.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a  Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted  at a peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public  comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document. Contractor support is required for the review, critical evaluation, interpretation, summarization, and integration of the available scientific knowledge base,  pertaining to oxides of nitrogen and sulfur as described  in the Statement of Work. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor is interested in this requirement,  please submit a request in writing via email to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive acquisition to Bell South using simplified commercial item acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Parts 12 and 13 for a local ISP access circuit (DS3) with unlimited usage, providing Internet access to the Florida Regional Center, 4000 N. Andrews Ave., Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33309.     Required features include: 

1.	Circuit bandwidth: DS3, 3 MB
2.	Two static public IP addresses for VPN equipment, network mask, and default gateway IP address.
3.	ISP interface connectors: RJ-45 with 10/100 Base-T interface.
4.	ISP availability: always on.
5.	ISP connection must not use network address translation (NAT).
6.	ISP must permit all IP protocols to include, but not be limited to, UDP, TCP, and IPSEC to transit without filters or proxies; unfiltered access to the Internet without ISP firewall blocking.
7.	ISP must permit installation of customer VPN encryption devices on circuit.
8.	Service must include Internet port, DS3 local loop, and router with maintenance.

The Government intends to award a purchase order of one year in duration starting July 13, 2007 solely for the purpose of allowing time to transition to the upcoming Networx contract to be awarded by the General Services Administration, which is expected to include this circuit, so that it will no longer be necessary after one year to obtain DS3 service separately.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  See note 22 with the exception that the time period is 8 days instead of 45 days.  Solicitation is not available at this time.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

Requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Florida is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of an award.  This is a Sole Source with Glen Research Corp. IAW FAR 6.302-1.

This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 2899 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 325998.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seeks to award a hybrid IDIQ/Time and Materials contract for Library Related Services and Training Support for Patent Examiners and Trademark Attorneys at our Alexandria, Virginia facility. This requirement is consistent with the USPTO?s 21st Century Strategic Plan in order to reduce patent pendency and to concentrate more on the core functions of examination and granting patents. The government will award a single contract for the required services. The period of performance for this requirement is anticipated to be for a base period of one year and four additional one-year option periods. The successful offeror under the RFP will also have the possibility of earning up to a total of five additional one-year award term periods. This requirement is anticipated to be a competitive 8(a) procurement under the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code 561210. Further information will be given in the Request For Proposal (RFP). The estimated release date of the RFP is the week of December 11, 2006. The RFP will be posted on USPTO?s business opportunity Internet site at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement related documents. Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and list of interested vendors will not be available. Questions regarding this procurement should be addressed to Teresa Kelley at Teresa.Kelley@USPTO.GOV.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is an invitation for bid (IFB) through a reverse auction (R A) and the solicitation number assigned is W15P7T-07-R-C006.  The solicitation will include all the instructions on how the Reverse Auction will be evaluated.  Furthermore, the solicitation will give instructions as to how each contractor can receive an ID  and Password for the Reverse Auction.  Early Delivery at no additional cost to the Government is encouraged.  Shipments are to be FOB Destination with Inspection/Acceptance at Source.  The items will be shipped to New Cumberland Facility, New Cumberland, PA. Items on the contract will be ordered by individual delivery orders.

Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of these units is not available from the Army. The Government will consider parts from other sources that have the same form, fit, and function as the required parts.   Alternate parts would have to pass extensive performance and qualifications testing to ensure the parts meet the Militarys requiremen ts, the cost of which would be considered in the acquisition decision.  Successful suppliers may be required to warrant that the item supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army.  Perspective offerors are requested t o validate bids for at least 90 days after the completion of the Reverse Auction.   The U.S. Army C-E LCMC has established the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry (ASFI) to allow electronic posting of Solicitation for Request for Proposals (RFPs ), Request for Quotations (R FQs), and Invitation for Bids (IFBs) from C-E LCMC to industry.  All parties interested in doing business with C-E LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  All responsible sources  may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The response date specified in the Solicitation shall override the response date specified in this Pre-Solicitation Notice.

It will have approximately 40 parking spaces, a separate service entrance drive, and dock area.  The overall building area of approximately 60,820 gross square feet including greenhouse, will result in a 53,800 square foot building site footprint.  Project includes four (4) greenhouse units connected to the laboratory building.  Floor plan contains adjacencies of labs, support functions and lab office areas based on a modular laboratory concept.

The laboratories will include: molecular biology, grape rootstock, media and buffer prep, tissue culture core labs, as well as support core areas including: nematode rearing room, fungal culture room, fungal dark room, plant growth chamber (light controlled) core growth chamber facility, fruit chemistry pilot plant, fruit chemistry cold room, shared autoclave room, shared dishwashing facility, core minus 80 degree freezer room, shared instrument room, and core cold room.

8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:
I.         Background

Since its independence, Armenia has emerged as a strategically important country in the Caucasus.  Its progress towards becoming a stable, European-oriented and democratic country with a transparent, market-based economy is important to U.S. security and economic interests in the region.  U.S. national interests in Armenia, and in the larger Caucasus region, revolve around security, conflict resolution, internal reform and energy security.  A settlement of the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the predominantly ethnic Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, and a rapprochement between Armenia and Turkey are both important U.S. foreign policy goals.  
USAID/Armenia?s partnership with the Armenian public and private sectors has been fruitful and helped lay the groundwork for the opportunities that now exist.  Since 1992, USAID, in coordination with other donors, has been instrumental in reforms in all economic and social sectors.  This assistance helped to build a new economic system from the ashes of the post-Soviet economic collapse, contribute to the development of social services that are more equitable, and build a more representative, responsive government. 
USAID?s relations with the Government of Armenia (GOAM) have matured substantially during the past 10 years.  The GOAM has evolved from a passive recipient of assistance into a more demanding and responsible partner that works to coordinate and influence donor efforts.  The GOAM now emphasizes development assistance, and has developed its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, into which it fits donor activities. 
With Armenia now in its second decade of post-Soviet independence, the challenges of the transition to democratic values and institutions and a market-based economy are now more nuanced.  While the effects of the Soviet system linger, the current choices Armenia must make in its future development are more the product of broader political and economic forces abroad and emerging asymmetries at home.  Principal among these challenges are high rates of poverty and unemployment, which have been little affected by recent GDP growth.  GDP growth has been fueled by import substitution and internal consumption, but this stimulus is likely to abate.  High flows of external assistance and investment, principally from official donors and the Armenian Diaspora, may not be a sufficient or reliable basis for long term growth in the 7-8% range required for a serious dent in poverty.  Rather, a sustainable basis for future growth seems to lie in increased public and private investment impacting the broad economic, demographic, and geographic landscape of Armenia.  Armenia needs to take a more aggressive stance fiscally and legislatively to ensure such investments take place and human and financial capital is deployed equitably and efficiently.

II.	Approach  

To date, USAID/Armenia?s Economic Growth and Private Sector Program has focused on accelerating the systemic restructuring of the economy toward a market orientation.  USAID assistance is concentrated on high level macroeconomic reform on the one hand, and on firm level assistance on the other.   In addition to our  efforts to create an improved environment for private sector activity ? in areas such as commercial, legal and regulatory reform, tax/customs reform, capital/financial markets development, accounting reform, information technology, and industry competitiveness, among others -- USAID also directly assists Armenian businesses and business associations, specifically in the form of credit, access to finance, technical assistance, and training to micro, small-, and medium-sized enterprises.  We also currently have specific programs which support activities in the areas of agribusiness, tourism, and information technology.  USAID also supports several activities providing micro loans to small-scale entrepreneurs, including economically active women living below the poverty line in under-served areas.
The FY2004-2008 USAID strategy for Armenia hinges on (a) robust growth in micro and small/medium enterprises (MSMEs) ? the economic segment most likely in the near term to create jobs, (b) companion public investment in a healthy and productive society, (c) a climate of governance conducive to those public and private investments, and (d) the presence of transparent, accountable institutions that respond to the needs and demands of a vigorous, informed and healthy Armenian society.  This narrowing of USAID/Armenia?s strategic attention and engagement to people-level and enterprise-level impact has been made possible by the generally conducive development environment now in place:  relative political stability, more or less the right set of macroeconomic policies, and a strong combination of formal and informal external financial flows that can couple with domestic savings for early results.  Indeed, it is this political-economic setting, and the performance that created it, which is the reason that Armenia has qualified for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) ? a reflection of past achievement and prospects for future success.
A finer sieve for program choices means that some broader structural reform or institutional strengthening activities from the FY1999-2003 strategy are wrapping up or will be recalibrated over the next couple of years.  Financial and capital market development is now concentrating more on promoting affordable and equitable access to investment credit and on financial products such as purchase order finance, factoring and corporate bonds and services such as credit bureaus of special relevance to SMEs.  
The ultimate objective of USAID interventions in micro-, small and medium enterprise development in Armenia is to improve these enterprises performance as a means to achieve higher economic growth and employment, and reduce poverty. Since 1995, the Mission has developed a portfolio of activities targeting the full continuum of micro-through medium-enterprise development. This portfolio consists of several major components:  1) enterprise level technical assistance, 2) micro-enterprise and microfinance support, 3) SME market development, 4) technical advisors, 5) finance and credit assistance for firms, including programs with EBRD and DCA, 6) financial market development (bank level technical assistance), 7) entrepreneur training, and 8) industry level competitiveness support.  
The Enterprise Advisor position will reside in the Office of Economic Restructuring and Energy Office (EREO). The incumbent will report to the EREO Director (or his designee), and as needed to Mission Management. The EREO office portfolio spans two strategic objectives: one focusing on increasing employment in a competitive private sector (targeting macroeconomic reforms and enterprise level assistance) and the other focusing on energy and water sector reform and development.  The Enterprise Advisor will be expected to support activities in the entire office, but in practice will be managing programs within the competitive private sector strategic objective.  
III. Major Duties and Responsibilities
The incumbent's main duties and responsibilities include:
A. The ENTERPRISE ADVISOR will serve as Core Team Member of S.O. 1.3 "Increased Employment in a Competitive Private Sector", and as an expert advisor to the Mission for matters pertaining to business, finance and enterprise and MSME development in Armenia..

The SO 1.3 portfolio spans a broad spectrum of topics including legal and regulatory reform at the macro and sectoral levels to increase private investment; to sub-sector inventions in support of privately owned small and medium enterprises (SME). This includes, for instance, activities such as: trade development, real estate market development, banking and finance, energy, micro-credit, market development, and business education.

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This work will be included in a larger procurement to rehabilitate and restore the Grange to its historical state. Also, this is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Mike Fox at Mike_Fox@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646, within 15 days of posting. Project Description:  The goal of this project is to provide for the relocation of historic Hamilton Grange from its present location to an approved location in St. Nicholas Park. This project is needed to avoid further deterioration of this historic landmark and a potential loss of the resource. Parts of the building have already decayed and have been lost. The move of Hamilton Grange (referred herein as the Grange) has been anticipated for a number of years. The Grange is currently situated on the east side of Convent Avenue approximately 80 feet north of 141st Street in the Borough of Manhattan, within the Hamilton Heights Historic District. It is located between a masonry apartment building on its north side and St. Luke's Episcopal Church, an 1892 masonry building on its south side. The Grange is physically attached to a portion of the apartment building and it is approximately four feet north of the north faade of the church. The challenge is to safely extricate the Grange from this very tight site and to move it to its proposed new location within an easement in St. Nicholas Park located at W 129th St. and Nicholas Terrace, while maintaining its integrity to be restored to its period of historic significance. The offeror shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, supplies and services to perform this task. Type of Procurement: A Small Business set aside is anticipated. NAICS Codes: 238990 The National Park Service anticipates the project's dollar value to be $1,500,000. National Park Service requests that potential contractors provide information on any government contract vehicles available to the National Park Service for procuring these services.

<SUBJECT>R--Remediation of Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUSTs) in Indian Country
<SOLNBR>PR-HQ-07-10319
<RESPDATE>120606
<ARCHDATE>01052007
<CONTACT>MI S. COX, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-2832, E-Mail: cox.mi@epa.gov; LEO T. MOOMAW, Contract Specialist, Phone: 202-564-4482, E-Mail: moomaw.leo@epa.gov
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE Remediation of Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUSTs) in Indian Country THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operation Division, Washington, DC, Office of Acquisition Management is currently seeking potential Small Business contractors who can perform all of the Statement of Work (SOW) requirements. The government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The SOW requirements fall under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620.   Interested Small Business status contractors must demonstrate in their qualification statement that they are qualified to perform the SOW under this NAICS code.  A SOW is posted on the following web page: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#sources.				 	This procurement is seeking technical and management services to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Underground Storage Tanks (OUST)  to support its Indian Country program to provide corrective action at sites where UST releases have contaminated soil and/or groundwater.  It should be noted that nearly all corrective actions are undertaken by UST owners and operators under the supervision of state or local agencies.  However, EPA oversees these activities in Indian Country, since EPA has primary responsibility for implementing the Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST) program in Indian Country.   	OUST seeks to achieve its goal of preventing leaking underground storage tanks by enhancing its regional, state, local and tribal enforcement and response capability.  As such, this procurement will provide technical expertise, assistance, and cleanups in Indian Country, and in extremely rare instances, in areas other than Indian Country so that cleanups are more efficient and cost effective.  This procurement will be performance-based which implements an integrated "one program" approach to enforcement and site cleanup.  In concert with the "one program" approach to enforcement and response, corrective action, enforcement oversight, and emergency response responsibilities are integrated into this single structure.   OUST supports early action to reduce immediate risk to human health and the environment by integrating site characterization and response activities, e.g., free product recovery and emergency response, with a focus on creating a streamlined site characterization and decision making process.  Tasks under the work areas defined in the Statement of Work will be specified, as needed, in work assignments and/or task orders, and their scope may be modified to reduce redundancies and accelerate cleanups.	 	This procurement provides site characterization, remedial or corrective action, oversight and enforcement assistance, and emergency response activities in Indian County under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Subtitle I), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, and the 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA).  The 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), that created a funding mechanism, known as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, provides statutory authority for EPA to oversee responsible party cleanups or for direct-lead cleanups at sites with insolvent, recalcitrant, or unknown responsible parties.  	The effort under this procurement includes four distinct efforts: (1) Evaluation of LUST Eligible Sites, e.g., attempt to locate responsible parties at the site by, at a minimum, searching and reviewing files of site owners and/or operators and other documents relating to past operators/owners; assisting with EPA efforts to identify the responsible parties at the site, evaluate their ability to pay for cleanup and provide support to EPA for cost recovery activities.  (2) Site Assessment/Site Characterization of LUSTs, i.e., site visits to gather and analyze data in support of responding to a potential LUST release, e.g., site management, community relations, site characterization, sampling analyses, analytical support, validation and evaluation of site data, and risk assessment based on EPA?s Indian Country guidance on risk-based decision-making process (RBDM) that supports  EPA?s responsibility in implementing the LUST program in Indian country.  (3)  Remediation of LUSTs, i.e., cleanup support in the major areas that impact the remediation of LUSTs, including initial abatement and emergency response, e.g.,  emergency response,  free product recovery, assisting EPA with the design of corrective action measures and implementation of corrective  actions, including work for engineering services.   (4) Oversight and Enforcement Responsibilities of LUSTs , i.e., technical field oversight in terms of documenting responsible party performance of field work, e.g., collection of split samples, performing sampling, screening, assessments, validating data, reviewing responsible party submittals associated with planning and implementing the corrective action.  THIS IS NOT AN UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK REMOVAL OR INSTALLATION CONTRACT.	 Small Business Status Contractors with the capability of providing services defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (maximum. 10 pages) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirements.  Responses are necessary to demonstrate capabilities/expertise in all aspects of the SOW and standard company brochures are not desired.  Responses, including the contractor?s Small Business status should be mailed to the following address: U.S. EPA, Attn: Mi Suk Cox (Mail Code 3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460.  HANDCARRY/COURIER/OVERNIGHT CARRIER ADDRESS: U.S. EPA, Ronald Reagan Building, Attn: Mi Suk Cox (3805R) 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20004.   Contractors may also submit their Capability Statements to Ms. Mi Suk Cox via email cox.mi@epa.gov.  A Capability Statement shall be submitted no later than 3:00 P.M., EST, 5 December 2006.  No feedback or evaluations will be provided regarding the information provided. This Sources Sought Synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Quote, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances ? the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

?	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.

The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent?s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

Background:

Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by the Federal and State governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America?s poorest people.  

Within broad national guidelines established by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program.  State participation in Medicaid is voluntary; however, all States have chosen to participate.  The federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, Section 6034, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  The MIP offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent inappropriate Medicaid payments.  It will also support the efforts of State Medicaid agencies through a combination of oversight and technical assistance.  Objectives of the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) include: 

?	Review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for fraud, waste or abuse;
?	Audit of paid claims for items or services furnished, or administrative services rendered;
?	Identification of overpayments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds under this title; and,
?	Education of providers of services, managed care entities, beneficiaries, and other individuals with respect to payment integrity and quality of care.


Type of Procurement:

This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates issuance of multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts under a forthcoming solicitation in the beginning of January 2007.  However, CMS reserves the right to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation.  It is anticipated the IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded as a base plus four (4) one-year options for a total not-to-exceed effort of 5 years.

SCOPE: Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in Albuquerque, New Mexico is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin company, for the United States National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)/Department of Energy (DOE). Sandia intends to contract for services in support of technical and administrative operations of the Z Machine, an advanced pulsed power accelerator, as part of its Pulsed Power Sciences Program. The high temperatures and intense power levels of the Z Machine enable Sandia to perform its mission in the study of high-energy density physics and in testing survivability issues related to the U.S. nuclear stockpile.  The Z Machine operates in an environment where radioactive materials are present and ionizing radiation is produced.  This environment requires compliance with all applicable government and Sandia National Laboratories? requirements to ensure worker safety and protection of the environment.

The scope of the Z Machine Operations encompasses the entire range of pulsed power related operations and maintenance of government-owned and Sandia-controlled equipment and facilities that include:

Award will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable quote from an authorized distributor of the product.

BRAND NAME:  The Department of Education has streamlined its hardware Load Balancer and Remote  Access platforms on products offered by F5 Networks.  Currently we employ two different products offered by F5, these are BigIPs for load balancing and Firepass for remote user access.

The continued use of F5 appliances today allows OCIO to reduce the required training of IT staff, support levels of multiple platforms, and implementation time of new systems as well as reduced levels of documentation that would be required to support multiple vendors.

It will not be cost effective for the Department if they had to replace all appliances.

Electronic offers are due on Wednesday November 29, 2006 by 3:00 pm to Steve Gagnon, Contract Specialist at Steve.Gagnon@ed.gov.   Please contact Steve Gagnon via email for information regarding this request for quote.

Contract Work Hours

Classes typically begin at 0800 and end at 1630 on each day with a ten (10) minute break every hour and an hour for lunch.  Occasional non-standard training days may be required by emergencies, and operational commitments; therefore, in these cases, as much prior notification as possible will be provided to the contractor.  However, the course is designed for whole days and should not vary substantially from this format, e.g., ending after a half-day on the last day, two-hour lunches or ending class two hours early on days in the middle of the week.  Likewise, extending past the normal ending time can only be done with the student?s option since many students may have off-hour commitments.

New Year's Day			Labor Day
Martin Luther King Day		Columbus Day

Inability of Contractor to Perform

In the event that an instructor is unable to teach a class due to illness, injury or death, the contractor must have a Contingency Plan (CP) in place to replace that instructor within twenty-four (24) hours at their own expense.  In addition, the government reserves the right to request that an instructor be replaced due to poor performance.  The CP must also address the manner in which this instructor will be replaced.  Such plans must be included along with the Technical Proposal and may be reviewed by the COTR at any time after award.

The maximum class size of the Forklift and Weight Handling Course is twenty five (25) students. While it is considered extremely unlikely that this will occur due to the high demand for this training, the government reserves the right to cancel a convening with fewer than thirteen (13) students at no cost/penalty to the government.  The contractor will be notified no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the first day of the class, if the minimum class size is not met.

The government will monitor his/her progress through a review of student critiques and, if necessary, a technical review.  It is expected that the instructional staff remain reasonably constant throughout the duration of the contract.

The Contracting Officer (KO) will inform the contractor directly of individuals who are acceptable.   Unacceptable documentation will be returned to the contractor indicating the reason(s) for rejection.  The KO will have the right to obtain, from the contractor, substantiation of information contained in any resume.

Quality Control

The contractor shall conduct training as specified on the topical outline of the course. The contractor is responsible for establishing, maintaining and monitoring the quality control of the services provided here under via a detailed Quality Control Plan (QCP) (Due with the Technical Proposal) clearly stating his/her procedures for ensuring quality.  As part of the above plan, the contractor shall establish and maintain an instructor evaluation system.  Records of all instructor evaluations for contract employees shall be kept current, complete and available to the Contracting Officer or COTR upon request during the performance of this contract.

Or, are they separate  portions of an Air Force form? A.Separate forms simply means we need to be able to separate the cost  portion from the technical portion.  It can be separate binders if you  choose. Q.  Part of Para 4.15 states Sweden will provide private access to long  distance phone lines (note 1). Does this mean Sweden will be paying for  all long distance telephone calls or will the fees be charged to the task.  How about telephones? A.  The Swedish government (i.e. Forsvarets Materielverk - FMV) will  provide telephones in the U.S. COMSEC Vault for the U.S. custodians to  conduct official business, as well as access to long distance phone lines  for official business purposes. It is anticipated that the U.S. custodians  will use e-mail for most communications to U.S. or European agencies; and  therefore, the need to conduct long distance phone calls should be  minimal. HQ USEUCOM / J-9 will be providing Secure Telephone Equipment  (STE) devices for the U.S. COMSEC Vault, so the U.S. Custodians may  conduct secure voice communications with NSA offices or HQ USEUCOM / J-9,  as may be required. Q.. Should computers, printers, pc supplies, internet connection and ISP  provider and office consumables be part of the Firm Fixed Price bid? A.  Desk top computers, printers, computer supplies, NSA/GSA approved  shredder, internet connection, ISP provider service, and normal office  consumable items (paper, pencils, etc) will be provided buy the Swedish  government (i.e. FMV), as may be required. Q. We dont see where it states Sweden will provide a proper (note 2) CMS  vault. A CMS vault is where all of the CMS material is stored. It must be  large enough to allow our two custodians to work in it on a regular basis.  Will Sweden be providing the CMS vault or is it to be part of the Firm  Fixed Price bid? A. The U.S. COMSEC Vault facility is located within the FMV complex (in  Stockholm) and has been inspected by the USAFE Information Assurance  Branch and approved / certified for classified operations and storage of  classified COMSEC material up to Secret Releasable to Sweden. The  facility meets the standards outlined in NAG-14, Safeguarding COMSEC  Material and Facilities; EKMS 1, EKMS Policy and Procedures; EKMS 3A,  Inspection Guide Manual, and Annex E, Inspection Guide for Fixed COMSEC  Facilities. (Re HQ USAFE / A6NI letter dated 28 July 2006). The vault has  a large office working area, a new outer door and combination lock meeting  NSA/GSA required standards, and an inner vault for storage of CCIs and  COMSEC key-mat material. The vault is completely ready for activation. Q. We are under the impression that the packing/shipping/unpacking of  employee household goods and the shipping of their POVs would be charged  to item 0002 Noun: MOBILIGATION AND DEMOBILIZATIONOF SUPPORT.  Will their  cola and housing allowance also be charged to this item? A. The vendor will pay for all costs associated with the packing /  shipping / unpacking of employee household goods, as well as the shipment  of any employee POVs.  Cost of Living Allowance and housing allowance will  be negotiated between the vendor and its employees (i.e. the Custodian  personnel).  The costs for vehicles used for official business by the U.S  COMSEC Custodians will not be provided by FMV.  The vendors will need to  include the vehicle cost in their Proposals. They should consider the cost  of a small vehicle, gas consumption on a monthly basis, and vehicle  maintenance.   We do not anticipate that the US COMSEC Custodians will  need to be doing a lot of driving on a monthly basis in the performance of  their official duties. In addition, the custodians could always take a  train from Stockholm, if they need to travel to a distant location within  Sweden. Q.  Would you be able to provide the city whereas the work is going to be  performed? A  The work will be performed in the city of Stockholm.  The COMSEC vault  is located at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) facility  complex. Q.  Do you have any documentation, such as MOA/LOI that states this work  is in compliance with US export and import regulation?  If so, could you  please provide a copy? A.  No.  We are not exporting or importing materials.  We are contracting  services. The work is to be accomplished in compliance with the EUCOM/NATO  requirements. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(a)  -  Sub-section L.II.B.3.7(h) requires offerors to furnish past performance information with their technical proposals.  Will the Air Force revise the evaluation criteria in Section M.II.2.0 to include Past Performance as Sub-factor 2 so that only offerors with actual COMSEC experience are deemed technically acceptable A.  No  The past performance requested in Sec L.II.B.3.7(h)  is for the  technical evaluators information.  It will not be a determining factor in  the final decision. Q.  Section M. II.2.0(e) - The RFP states that an "offeror's price will be evaluated to ensure that proposed costs are reasonable and realistic" will the Air Force actually perform a price analysis on CLIN  001, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(b) on CLIN 0001, and a cost realism analysis, pursuant to FAR 15.404-1(d) on CLIN 002? A.  Yes Q.  Section B CLIN 0002 - Does this cost element include the cost of housing (including miscellaneous household living items) for the personnel in Sweden, car rental, shipping, local transportation as well as travel expenses for the personnel? A.  It includes travel over and back as well as approved change in  personnel and NSA training.  All other costs are to be in CLIN 0001 Q. Regarding the SOW.   Does a US COMSEC account already exist or will it  need to be established? Will the primary and/or alternate COMSE Managers  participate in establishing a new COMSEC account?  If so, what will this  entail and if not, who will carry out all of the "one time" tasks/duties  required to establish a new US COMSEC account? A.  The US COMSEC Account has not been established because the COMSEC  Custodians have not been named yet.  The vault issue has been addressed in  question # 3 and has been approved by NSA.  Once the COMSEC Custodians are  named, NSA will establish a COMSEC account number.  After the COMSEC  Custodians arrive into Sweden, they will receive the COMSEC Custodian  training at Stockholm that will be provided to them from NSA Europe  (NCEUR).  (The travel funding for this training will be provided by USAF  ESC/KLI.) For more information on "Sweden COMSEC", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5070

Can you please let me know if there have been any changes or Q&As  regarding the solicitation? A. I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far on PIXS/FedBuzOpps, by COB  today (22 Nov 06). Q.  Section G.  Does G002 Program Manager refer to the Government program  manager, or does G002 refer to the Contractors program manager?? If G002  refers to a Government employee, will that position be approximately  equivalent to a Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTRT)  and, if so, will that individual be located in Sweden or at Wright  Patterson Air Force Base?? A. The G002 PM is the Government PM who is located at WP.  The COTRT will  be located in Sweden and that person is yet to be determined. Q  F 33 - Does item number 9 on the Standard Form 33 contain the correct  due date for receipt of proposals as 1 December 2006, or is the Original  Response Date on the Synopsis to the Solicitation and the Response Date on  the PIXS of November 30, 2006 the correct due date?? Which is the correct  due date?  If this is not cleared up, doesnt it leave the potential for  confusion for any of the bidders participating? A.  The correct date is 1 Dec 2006.  I have corrected the date on PIXS.  Thanks, for catching that. Q.   Amendments 01 and 02 - The amendments are listed at the FedBizOpps  but the link does not reveal the actual documents. Will the Air Force post  these two (2) amendments to the FedBizOpps? A.  The only changes in Amendments 01 & 02 were administrative wording in  the bottom text area. Q. Amendments 01 and 02 - Will the Air Force issue the actual amendments  using Standard Form 30 with attachments as applicable A.     No Q.  Questions and Answers - Will the Air Force post the questions from  offerors and the Governments answer to those questions on the FedBizOpps  for all offerors to read pursuant to FAR 15.201(f) and the Comptroller  General Decision number B-246301, 92-1? A.  I plan to post all the Q&A I have so far in the test area of PIXS by  COB today, 22 Nov 06. Q.  SF 33/Section L - What does the sentence Electronic copies are  acceptable mean? Does the Air Force want to receive proposal by e-mail  only? Or, does the Air Force want the proposals on a CD? Does the Air  Force want the original proposal in hard copy with electronic copies on a  CD? A.  Electronic Copy is any electronic form be it CD, or email, as long as  it is provided to us by COB 1 Dec 06.  Hard copies are also acceptable. Q.  Section B CLIN 0001 - Is the Unit Price and Total Item Amount strictly  limited to the fully burdened price for the personnel labor to the  exclusion of any other type of cost? A.

<DESC>In the interest of clarifying the SIR, one final set of Q&A is posted.  No further questions will be accepted as the due date has past.  

Q - The response to the 2nd question refers offerors to the NISPOM, Chapter 2, et al.  In Section 2-100 of Chapter 2 appears the following language: ?Contract award may be made prior to the issuance of an FCL. However, in those cases, the contractor will be processed for an FCL at the appropriate level and must meet eligibility requirements for access to classified information.?
 
Request for Clarification:  (1) Based on the language of 2-100, may an offeror in this instance that does not yet have a TS Facility Clearance submit a proposal before and in anticipation of award if the offeror otherwise meets eligibility requirements for access to classified information at the TS level, and (2) will TSA sponsor the processing of an FCL at the appropriate level after award?
 
A - In this instance, contractors must apply with the DSS agency and while applying for the FCL must also apply for the Key perosnnel at the company to apply for the same level clearance.  Since DSS is backlogged, this process could take 6 months or more and would not allow personnel from this company to be hired against the contract until it is completed.  Any work stoppage caused by this process would be unacceptable to the program.

Q - The response to the fifth question asks about ?audit approved? G&A rates but TSA states that certified cost and pricing data is not required.  

Request for Clarification:   Please clarify what constitutes and will be acceptable as an ?audit approved G&A rate.?  In the alternative, are firms who lack approved forward pricing rates from DCAA excluded from the competition, or may small business offerors who lack DCAA approved rates otherwise propose a competitive G&A/Material Handling Loader Percentage as part of their competitive proposal to be included in the evaluation along with evaluation of loaded rates?

A - Such rate may only be substituted in the absence of an audit approved rate and the bidder must identify that it does not have an audit approved rate when proposing the substitute.  
 

Q - In view of the criticality of these additional clarifications to many small businesses in making a bid/no bid decision, and in view of the Thanksgiving Holidays just preceding the submission date, will TSA please consider extending the due date from Noon on Thursday, November 30 to 9:00 AM on Monday, December 4, 2006?  

A - No extension can be granted.  Due to the tight turnaround period for evaluation and vetting of contractor employees through the TSA internal security process any delay in the receipt and evaluation of proposals could impact the service provided to the program office.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DOSIMETRY SERVICES TO SUPPORT THE DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES OF THE NASA PLUM BROOK REACTOR FACILITY IN SANDUSKY OHIO.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will	not be issued. __________ The purpose of this amendment is to provide the Statement of Work which is listed below: Statement of Work Whole Body and Extremity Monitoring To Support the Decommissioning Activities of the  NASA Plum Brook Reactor Facility (PBRF) in Sandusky, Ohio 1.0  Background The NASA Plum Brook Reactor Facility (PBRF) is currently being decommissioned under a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Decommissioning Plan.  NASA retains the NRC license responsibilities including that of protecting the radiation workers from radiation exposure. As part of this action, NASA has the responsibility to provide whole body and extremity monitoring to guarantee the safety of the workers. 2.0 Scope The whole body and extremity monitoring contract is expected to be needed for 3-5 years.  In the following descriptions of the services required, an approximate minimum level of required service is given, as well as an expected range. The nature of the PBRF Decommissioning Project and its phasing out over a number of years means that it is not possible to state with certainty today what exact level of service will be required. The contractor may wish to address the question of price by giving a per occurrence cost, or pricing the minimum level of service requested, and then giving an iterative or unit cost for additional work beyond that.  The contractor shall provide NASA PBRF with the requested quantity of Thermo Luminescent Dosimeters (TLDs) for whole body monitoring each month or as requested, at least five (5) working days before the current month ends. Additional TLDs may be requested for environmental monitoring use. NASA PBRF will notify the contractor of the required quantity far enough in advance to prevent delays in delivery. The number of people requiring TLDs is expected to vary from approximately 20 to 160 over the course of the decommissioning. The contractor will also provide the required TLDs for extremity monitoring, again on a monthly or as requested basis and in the quantities requested by NASA PBRF. The personal dosimetry program shall be implemented in accordance with ANSI/HPS N13.11-2001, Personnel Dosimetry Performance  Criteria for Testing. The extremity dosimeter program shall meet the performance criteria of ANSI/HPS N 13.22 995, Performance Testing of Extremity Dosimeters. Each month or as requested, the contractor will take receipt of the TLDs from the previous period and will process them. In the event that any individuals reading is at or above 300 mrem for the month the contractor will contact NASA PBRF immediately by phone, with an e-mail follow up to a designated NASA PBRF employee. The facility performing the dosimetry processing must hold a current accreditation under the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all eight (8) dosimeter categories. The contractor will provide NASA PBRF with a copy of its most recent NVLAP performance testing results, as well as a copy of the Laboratory TLD Quality Manual (as required by NVLAP). The contractor may include a discussion of any provisions they will make for audits by NASA, or for their ability to provide data reconstruction upon request.  The contractor will be responsible for maintaining the dose records for all monitored individuals.  Besides these annual reports the contractor will supply NASA with monthly reports showing the most recent dose levels received by workers. Additionally, the contractor will supply NASA with an electronic version (Microsoft Excel or Word or similar format) of the monthly and annual reports that will enable NASA to properly and easily incorporate the electronic version of the contractors monthly report of the TLD readings. This electronic reporting will enable NASA to properly track the individuals doses and to prepare the required NRC Form 4 and NRC Form 5 reports. The resulting dose records must be in accordance with NRC Reg Guide 8.7, Instructions for Recording and Reporting Occupational Radiation Exposure Data. The contractor will be responsible for maintaining all records concerning the calibration, maintenance, and operation of the TLD processing equipment.  __________ The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on November 21, 2006. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
