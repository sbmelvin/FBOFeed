<DESC>This acquisition will be a firm-fixed-price commercial service for the Development, Preparation, cGMP Manufacturing and Testing of Antiplaque Chewing Gum Containing Antimicrobial Peptides for Phase I Clinical Trial.  This service shall be performed for the U.S. Army Dental and Trauma Research Detachment (USADRTD), a detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).  The USADRTD has developed several candidate antimicrobial peptides that could be used for controlling plaque-associated oral infection, including dental caries.  The USADTRD is particularly interested in developing antimicrobial systems that could be incorporated into the military field ration, specifically into chewing gum.  Their use of this novel antiplaque chewing gum could significantly reduce the incidence of dental emergencies among deployed forces by controlling plaque formation, allowing sustained operations in extreme environments while maintaining mission capabilties.  In pursuit of this objective, the USADTRD is interested in the dvelopment and manufacturing of small scale current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) antiplaque chewing gum containing USADTRDs antimicrobial peptide (KSL-W) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which exhibit broad-range bactericidal activities, to be used in the oral cavity for improving the oral health of the deployed soldiers.  In conjunction with this effort, the USADTRD is interested in determing the stability of this prototype cGMP antiplaque chewing gum and the release kinetics of the bacteria-fighting agent from the gum formulations.<BR><BR>The specific objective of the requirement is to manufacture, according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 210 and 211, a Phase I Lot of Antiplaque Chewing Gum (APCG) with associated internal Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) reviews, for use in nonclinical animal and human clinical studies, as defined and summarized in the Quality System Plan (provided in the RFQ) which identifies the roles and responsibilities of the US Army and Manufacturer.<BR><BR>Contract Requirements:  All work to be accomplished under this Contract shall be in accordance with the requirements of the contract and in strict accordance with the contract technical specifications.  <BR><BR>One contract shall be awarded on a Best Value basis to the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the government given its responsiveness to all aspects and requirements of the solicitation and considering price and other non-price related factors.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325411.  The RFQ will be available for downloading at the Army Single Face to Industry website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi on or about 6/26/2009.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be mailed and telephone requests will not be honored.  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), accessed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

Description of Supplies or Services: The requested equipment, including hardware , accessories and accompanying software, creates a complete acute care adult volume ventilator with expanded capacity, necessary to meet the requirements of intensive care needs to support the veteran population in a tertiary care facility.  Cost of this procurement will be $294,881.494.	Statutory Authority:  	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;	(  )  (4) International Agreement	( X )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;	(  )  (6) National Security; or	(  )  (7) Public Interest5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  P.L. 109-461 amends 38 U.S.C. allowing the VA the unique ability to sole source directly to SDVOSB.  Video Telecommunication Inc., a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, that has the ability provide the required supplies and services to VA Puget Sound Healthcare System.  6.	 Actions to Promote Competition:  This requirement was previously available on the Federal Supply Schedule under a limited sources basis.  However, the only contractor that could provide the unique system was determined non-responsive. No further actions are taken at this time to seek sources outside of statutory requirements.7.	 Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: It is the Contracting Specialists determination that this acquisition represents the best value in accordance with FAR 13.106-3:  Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases.  These exact items were determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 8.404(d).  Furthermore, the vendor provided an additional discount of $4,650.84 to meet the Government's budget.8.	Market Survey (FAR 7.102): The requested equipment is identical to and expands upon the current equipment already in use at this facility.  It will replace older generation ventilation devices with same make and is consistent with the current support tools and Standard Operating Procedures in use in this department.  Other manufacturers were considered but the desire to maintain continuity in parts, training, and policies was felt to be overriding.  Staff members were sent to the University of Washington Medical Center to access the possible benefit and applicability of expanded monitoring modes that this equipment offered that is not available from other manufacturers.  It was concluded that this equipment met our needs and required fewer changes to policy and training than other manufacturers.  It was further determined that this equipment represented the best fit for our organization and best value to the government.  This equipment is proprietary to this manufacturer and no other provider could be found that effectively interfaced with the systems. 9.	Other Considerations: This brand of equipment will allow VA Puget Sound Healthcare System to be compatible with existing equipment at the University of Washington Pulmonary department as well as Harbor View Medical Center, facilitating the training of Pulmonary Fellows and students across the University system.10.	 Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources have expressed in writing an interest in this acquisition.11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: No actions intended as the action is based on statutory authority for sole source.  12.
