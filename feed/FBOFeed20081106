<DESC>1 October 2002 the Army mandated use of a group of Blanket Purchase Agreements BPAs for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of this BPA initiative were to ensure that office product purchases were in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the Javis Wagner ODay Act JWOD now known as Ability One and to capture economies of scale.  The purpose of this annoucement is to alert vendors and consortiums of the new procurement of Army BPAs.  Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center Knox intends to procure office products, inks and toners through the issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreements under the GSA Federal Supply Schedules. RFQ availability is estimated December 2008 via Federal Business Opportunities, Army Single Face to Industry and the Fort Knox Contracting web site.  No hard copy quotes will be issued.  All CONUS Army users are now required to purchase office products through the BPAs.  However, Army installations with onsite self service supply store may use this source to obtain Ability One products.  To the maximum extent practicable the BPA purchases must be made through DOD EMALL.  The Army intends to award sufficient BPAs to ensure adequate delivery coverage consistent with the concept of Army wide BPAs, achieve best value for BPA customers, compliance with the Ability One Program.  Vendors should review FED BIZ OPPS, ASFI for future annoucement on the issuance of the RFQ.

Scope of WorkBackground:  BACKGROUND  Tiis tsozi BiOlta (Crownpoint Community School) is a Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) operated school located in Eastern Navajo Agency, McKinley County, Crownpoint, New Mexico.  The school operates a day and residential program serving approximately 475 Navajo students.  There are 95 employees; of this number, 32 are teachers and 15 education technicians.  The school is accredited by Navajo North Central Accreditation (NNCA) and New Mexico State Department of Public Education (NMPED). Tiis Tsozi BiOlta (Crownpoint Community School) has been identified in Corrective Action (CA-1) Year 1 for school year 2007-2008.  This action is based on low standardized test scores in Reading and Math on the New Mexico Standards Based Assessment administered during school year 2006-2007 and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) Annual Report.  According to the No Child Left Behind (NCLB), Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) is the progress needed each year to have all children proficient and advanced by the year 2014. Prior to the determination of CA-1, the school spent two years in School Improvement status.  During these years, the school employees developed and implemented a School Improvement Plan that entailed scientifically research-based programs, school-wide strategies and best practices to increase test scores and student achievement.  The school failed to make AYP despite relentless implementation efforts. The school and instructional staff have a serious need for technical assistance to improve their instructional program in an effort to increase student performance and achievement to attain Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).  The school staff and school board are in support of the decision to contact an outside resource to provide technical assistance, to analyze our data, evaluate the instructional program and strategies to address the underlying factors hindering our ability to make AYP.

AFTER HOURS ACCESS TO CARESTATEMENT OF WORK
INTRODUCTION
The contractor is a firm that provides telephone answering services for the Naval Medical Center San Diego, and its Branch Medical Clinics.
During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to provide, on behalf of the Government, telephone answering services for eligible prime patients enrolled in the San Diego area TRICARE Prime System.
DEFINITIONS
Commander: The use of "Commander" throughout this section means: Commander, Naval Medical Center, San Diego, CA or designated representative (e.g., Technical Liaison of Department Head).
Sponsor:  A uniformed services member - whether active duty, retired or deceased - whose relationship to the patient makes them eligible for TRICARE benefits.  The sponsor's Social Security number (with a two- number prefix added) is used to identify the sponsor and all their Family Members.
Active Duty (AD) - The person that actually works for the Military.  He/she typically is the person that wears the Uniform.  Non-Active Duty (NAD): Most generally refers to retired military - and this does NOT refer to age. For example, if someone joins the Navy at 18 years of age & retires from the service at 38 years of age, he/she is a retired military or Non Active Duty.
Family Member (FM) and Family Member Prefix:  The sponsor's dependents.  The Sponsor and Family Member's identification number is the sponsor's social security number, plus a "Family Member Prefix" which indicates who they are in the family.  This number comes before the social security number.  (20/Active Duty; 30/spouse; 01/eldest child; 02/next child, etc.)   For example: Joe Doe is AD = Active Duty, social security number:  123-45-6789; Joe Doe's Wife is a Family Member, her ID: 30/123-45-6789; Tommy Doe is Joe's first born son, his ID: 01/123-45-6789
Non-Active Duty Family Members (NADFM):  Family members of Non Active Duty.  Another similar term for Non Active Duty Family Member is Non Active Duty Dependent (NADD). In its most general terms (where it is used for certain data analysis), NAD & NADD can refer to everyone who is not an Active Duty (AD) nor Active Duty Dependent (ADD) - including over 65, etc. 
Primary Care Manager (PCM):  A military or civilian network provider or medical clinic.  A PCM provides  health care and coordinates specialty medical needs.  If a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) is the PCM, the MTF assigns an individual provider in the facility.  
Provider:  Healthcare Specialist (Doctor, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, etc.) that cares for the Patient and coordinates any specialty services or needs.  At Naval Medical Center San Diego and the Branch Clinics, there are Uniformed Providers = Active Duty Providers, and Civilian Providers = not in uniform but work with the Military; also called Network Providers.
TRICARE Outpatient Clinic (TOC): The TRICARE Outpatient Clinics at Naval Medical Center San Diego are part of the Primary Care Directorate.  There are three San Diego locations - one in Clairemont Mesa,  one in Chula Vista and one in Santee.  These clinics see almost all Family Members of Active Duty and Retired Military & their Family Members (excluding Active Duty and most people over 65 years old).  Their after hours coverage has TWO DIFFERENT PAGERS & PROVIDERS - one for adults, and one for Pediatrics (newborn to 17 years of age).  
TRICARE: is the Department of Defense health care program for members of the uniformed services and their families and survivors, and retired members and their families. TRICARE brings together the health care resources at Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and supplements them with networks of civilian health care professionals to provide quality care and better access to our beneficiaries.  For eligible beneficiaries, the TRICARE program offers a triple-option health care plan: 
.	TRICARE Prime.  A TRICARE choice where Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) are the principal source of health care.  TRICARE Prime is the managed care option offered by the Department of Defense. It integrates military and civilian health care into a single health care system. Beneficiaries who choose this option agree to a one-year enrollment, and select a Primary Care Manager (PCM) to provide or arrange for their health care needs. The TRICARE Prime option offers additional wellness and preventive care services. 
.	TRICARE Standard.  A fee-for-service option that is the same as the former CHAMPUS benefit. Beneficiaries using this option have the greatest choice of civilian providers, but at a higher cost. The beneficiary is responsible for a deductible plus co-payments. Enrollment is not required to participate. 
.	TRICARE Extra.  Similar to TRICARE Standard but offers discounts to patients when they use TRICARE network providers. This option allows beneficiaries to receive their care from civilian network providers at a reduced cost compared to TRICARE Standard. There are no claim forms to file-just pay your reduced co-payment after satisfying the deductible. You may use a combination of the TRICARE Extra and Standard programs at any time, depending on whether you choose providers inside or outside the network. Enrollment is not required to participate.  DUTY HOURS
The contractor shall provide services commencing on the date specified in this contract.  Specific clinic hour coverage is defined in Attachment A.  The contractor shall provide answering services during the hours of 1600-0700 Monday through Friday, and all day Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays.  The contractor shall be compensated for all actual calls handled during the specified coverage, including calls handled during regular clinic hours of operation.
DUTIES
The contractor shall provide an answering service in an off-site location, using contractor-provided, fully-trained staff (answering operators are to be intelligible and English-speaking), facilities, equipment, information technology support, and supplies.  The contractor shall provide services to the Naval Medical Center San Diego (General Pediatrics, Adolescent Clinic, and Internal Medicine) and the Primary Care Clinics (MCAS Miramar, NAS Coronado, Naval Training Center (NTC), TRICARE Outpatient Clinics (TOC), and the Active Duty Clinics).
The contractor shall triage the caller to the appropriate clinic, and if that clinic is open during time of call (see Attachment A) the contractor shall either give the caller the clinic number, or proceed as defined for each clinic in Attachment A.  Attachment A also includes the pager numbers for the points of contact for the specialty care services and examples of monthly call schedules. The contractor shall, on some occasions,  also provide services during regular clinic hours.  The Government will review Attachment A monthly and update same as required to ensure all contact information and regular clinic hours of operation covered in this contract are correct.   NOTE:  As required, the contractor shall accommodate unexpected provider and pager number changes without impact to the manner the answering service is conducted. 	The contractor shall receive incoming calls from prime beneficiaries and shall record the following:Caller's relationship to the patientPatient's First & Last Name Sponsor's First & Last Name Family Member prefix Sponsor's Social Security NumberPatient's date of birthPatient's Primary Care Manager (PCM)Reason for the call	Caller's phone number they would like the Provider to phone
The contractor shall then triage the caller to the appropriate clinic (see Attachment A) and if the clinic is open, proceed per above.  If the clinic is closed, the contractor shall page the appropriate provider following the instructions listed in Attachment A.
Note:  If the caller states that he/she needs a Specialist (Pediatric Endocrinology, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Pediatric Surgery, etc.), please see Attachement A for clinic pager listings and protocol, clinic hours, and information to be given to callers during open clinic hours.			The anticipated workload will ultimately be dependent upon the type and number of prime patients in the San Diego area TRICARE Prime System.   Under this contract, NMCSD will certify and pay only for the actual number of beneficiary calls placed with the contractor. The anticipated call volume and reports will consist of approximately 1100 basic calls and 200 pager dial outs per month.

The proposed acquisition is for seven counterintelligence analysts to provide technical and analytical intelligence/counterintelligence support to supplement the DSS Counterintelligence Office federal workforce.

The place of performance for this contract will be at DSS headquarters in Alexandria, VA, Columbus, Ohio and Linthicum Md.

DSS will make award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the natural gas distribution system for the Yeager Air National Guard Base located in Charleston West Virginia, to Mountaineer Gas.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Mountaineer Gas (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The natural gas system being privatized is described as follows: Yeager ANGS is home to the 130th Airlift Wing, which provides staff and operational support for C-130H aircraft. Yeager ANGS is located a Charleston West Virginia and has a total of 74.8 acres under lease.  Of this total, 43 acres are located on top of the hill on which the airport was built.  Most of this area has been developed.  Any expansion requires relocation of existing buildings to other areas, using vehicle parking areas, or acquiring additional land.  The lower portion of the base has been developed along the access road to the airfield.  This section contains approximately 33 acres.  Development has been on benches made from leveling hilltops or cutting into the side of hills.  The developed area in this lower section covers 9.3 acres.  The remainder is made up of hillsides and ravines which are expensive to develop.  The apron and taxiway at Yeager Airport were built in 1949.  The first facilities built were Building 101-Base Supply, Building 107-Maintenance Hangar, and Building 102-Headquarters in 1951.  The base currently has 31 buildings with a total square footage of 295,051.   The natural gas distribution system at Yeager AGS (ANG) is comprised of approximately 4,300 linear feet of polyethylene and steel pipe ranging from 1.25 to 4 inches in diameter, 17 steel plug valves, 2 PE ball valves, 12 regulators and 1 large meter.  The most common type of system piping is a 50% mix of PE and steel buried approximately 4 feet underground.  Piping and valves are considered to be in good condition with ages ranging from 1951 to present.  The delivered PSIG of the system is 30 PSIG and reduced to a 6 to 8 PSIG for service lines.  The system has no cathodic protection devices and is metered from one location on base.  There are three planned facilities that will require gas service once completed.  The Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar (63,000 SF, a new facility which will increase demand for natural gas.  The Aircraft Maintenance Hangar (50,000 SF), and the Communications Facility are replacements for existing buildings.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000 and no offers were received This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH)   requires services to provide operation and maintenance to the Central Utility Plant (CUP) at the NIH Research Triangle Park, North Carolina location.  The CUP provides all utility services for heating, cooling, electrical distribution, and hazardous waste incineration for NIH’s National Institute of Environment Health Sciences (NIEHS) campus and the adjoining campus of the Environmental Protection Agency at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 561210 and Small Business size standard is $32.5 million. NIH intends to procure these services as a competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set side.  

The projected date for issuance of the solicitation is on or about November 21, 2008. The Solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) site only.
NIH anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with performance period of one base year and four one-year options. The anticipated award date is February 20, 2009. 
The government anticipates allowing a site visit to provide potential offerors an opportunity to tour the facility. It is anticipated that the site visit will take place approximately one week after the RFP is released.

BACKGROUND:  The NIEHS Campus, completed in 1982, is Government-owned, expandable location which includes administration, laboratory, and support facilities.  The NIEHS Campus consists of 374.5 acres of land, eight buildings, roadways, parking areas, and an underground utilities system.  There are also 13 temporary modular type buildings on the northern portion of the site.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also has a facility located on the adjoining Government owned property which includes approximately 1,000,000 sq. ft. of office and laboratory space.  This facility is heated and cooled from the NIEHS CUP.

The NIEHS and EPA are research complexes containing complicated and sophisticated building environmental support and utility systems to support long term research.  Animals are widely used in this research.  These test animals are housed in very tightly controlled conditions of temperature and humidity, and are supplied with conditioned air that has been filtered to remove microorganisms and chemicals which could adversely affect the outcome of a research project.  Laboratories contain extremely complex and expensive test equipment which requires, in many cases, a very closely controlled environment to function properly.  Responsiveness and skill by contractor employees to operate, maintain, repair and restore operation and control of the utilities support systems is extremely critical for the protection of the integrity of the many research programs being conducted at this facility.  

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  Provide all personnel, supervision, management, equipment, materials, supplies, tools, and all other items necessary to operate and maintain the CUP, which provides all utilities’ services for heating, cooling, electrical distribution, and hazardous waste incineration for the NIH/ORF North Carolina Facilities and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Services shall include, but not limited to, operation of utilities systems and their associated mechanical/electrical plants; preventive maintenance and repair maintenance on utility plants and equipment.  The contractor will be required to operate, maintain and repair all mechanical, electrical and utility systems in four buildings which include 1) Consolidated Computer Room, 2) Central Utility Plant, 3) Incinerator Building, and 4) Electrical Sub-Station.  Three of the buildings include distribution of high voltage electricity, high temperature hot water (HTHW), chilled water (CHW).  The requirement includes operations, maintenance and management of repair of all underground and above ground distribution piping and wiring and equipment associated with electricity, HTHW, CHW, PW (Domestic Water; underground piping only), valve pits and sewer effluent piping and fire protection distribution piping, and system controls up to and including the first cut-off valve or disconnect inside all buildings on the NIH/NIEHS Campus and between the CUP and the outlet of the isolation valve within the valve pits serving the EPA Campus.  Contractor personnel shall have experience with various sizes and types of complex equipment.  Examples would be experience with high temperature hot water generators (40 MBTU each), water chillers (greater than 2,000 tons each), electrical substation distribution (13,800 volts), hazardous waste incineration, wet scrubber operation and the operations of facilities that contain multipurpose laboratories to include animal laboratories. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  All questions concerning this solicitation must be directed in writing via email to ervin.spivey@nih.gov.  No questions or inquiries will be accepted by telephone. The distribution of the resulting solicitation will be accomplished solely through FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation documents will not be available; therefore, no written, telephone, or facsimile requests for the documents will be accepted. The FedBizOpps site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including the solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps site.

"Proposed Issue Date:  20 November 2008
"Title of Project:  Stabilize and Restore North Officers Quarters at Fort Larned National Historic Site, Larned, Kansas
"Description:  The work of this contract consists of stabilizing the North Officers' Quarters (HS-09) building exterior and protect it from further weathering and restore the interior to the historic period.  The National Park Service seeks a contractor who is has the capability or the capability of a qualified subcontractor to perform "museum quality restoration" on a 1868 historic military residence that retains a high proportion of historic materials but suffers from chronic foundation failure and severely deteriorating windows, doors, and badly worn interior finishes.  The North Officers Quarters is a one story duplex officers quarters of approximately 4,100 square feet.  Each side of this duplex consists of four square rooms off a central hall with kitchen wings behind.  The duplex also includes handsome local sandstone that is both relatively weak and performs poorly when wet.  The duplex remains in a natural unpainted state which will require an application of a proprietary Prosoco, Inc. consolidation treatment as part of the contract.  The stone work retains a high degree of character imparted by the original stone masons and requires good workmanship knowledge to repair in order to retain the historic expressions of the original masons.  Each side of this duplex has 12 double hung windows and fifteen doors that require extensive repair.  Interior finishes consist of plaster and painted wood trim.  Plaster is a traditional three coat system on lath or directly on stone masonry.  The old natural wood floors will require skillful patching of new wood to blend in with older period work.  The ultimate goal of the project is to open the building to the public with historic period furnishings to illustrate how it may have looked when the fort was occupied by the Army.  The hallways will be open to allow the visiting public to view the furniture and artifacts though barriers in the doorways.  
The primary disciplines will require repairs to sandstone walls, traditional plaster wall finishes and finish carpentry and Lead and Bat Guano abatement.  Some grading and drainage work will be required to keep the basement dry but any grading will be executed with due care and prior approval to fully protect the historic stone walls and potentially unknown archeological deposits.  This project will also require painting and roofing and with the exception of a few inconspicuous housekeeping duplex outlets and retention/reinstallation of alarm components, this building will have no active HVAC or MEP.
Fort Larned will be open to the public during construction although the construction site will be properly cordoned off.  The successful contractor will be expected to be sensitive and responsive to the need to produce an authentic project as possible.  Construction means and methods are often at the contractor's discretion but will require prior approval to guarantee required authentic results.
"Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
"Estimated price range: $750,000 to $1,000,000.
"Time for completion: 365 calendar days. 
"Proposal receipt date is approximate: Actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
"All responsible HUBZone sources may submit an offer that will be considered.
"HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns  and  52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEASE OFFICE SPACE
IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN (SFO# GS-05B-18174)

REQUIREMENT:
General Services Administration is interested in leasing office and related space consisting of approximately 3,927 rentable square feet, which will yield approximately 3,415 ANSI BOMA usable square feet for personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  The space will be occupied by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.

LEASE TERM:
Ten (10) years; Five (5) years firm term.  

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
The Government is seeking expressions of interest from potential sources for office space in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Office space must be contiguous and have potential for efficient layout.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including seventeen (17) secured parking spaces in accordance with local building code.  All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the rental consideration.

<DESC>A Pre-Solicitation notice is being published by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (USAINSCOM).<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command anticipates the need to acquire services to support the sustainment of the Signatures Support Program (SSP) formally know as the National Signatures Program (NSP).  The SSP is a joint, multi-agency activity sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to meet increased customer demands for signature data.  The SSPs overarching goal is to facilitate the access to high-quality signatures to a diverse customer base.  To do this, the NSP leverages the full spectrum of signature related activities (initial collection, processing, development, detailed analysis, and production) within the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community (IC), and various other U.S. Government agencies.  The program addresses a host of signature types, including, but not limited to, acoustic, biological, chemical, seismic, radio frequency, infrared, radar, nuclear radiation, electro-optical, and biometrics.  The SSP provides access to signature data on foreign and domestic military and commercial systems such as ground vehicles, fixed and rotary wing aircraft, missiles, munitions, rockets, ships, and submarines, as well as other types of signature data e.g. chemical and biological warfare agents, lasers, and dynamic phenomena (events and activities).<BR><BR>This contracts scope of work includes support to collection efforts, as well as processing, analysis, categorizing, and modeling of measurement and signature data from various sources and targets, and across multiple disciplines worldwide. It also includes database assessment, modification, testing, installation, maintenance, sustainment and upgrades to components of the SSP Application as well as the scientific programs (analytical tools) used to process and/or manage the signature data. This also encompasses efforts to support SSP Signature Organizations and other activities as they relate to measurement and signature processing and analysis, as well as the establishment and sustainment of a system of Signature Organizations operating within the SSP for the generation, management, and utilization of Signature Data within the National Signature Community.  In order to efficiently sustain and modify a high-quality and meaningful data repository system, it is essential for the contract awardee to have working knowledge and expertise in the collection, processing, and analysis of signature data, as well as current expertise in Oracle database design.<BR><BR>A Solicitation will be posted on or about 14 November 2008.  <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery - Gravesite Development and Cemetery Improvements, Phase I and Phase 5, in St. Louis, MissouriThe Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management has a need for a Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) or Civil Engineering (NAICS 541330) firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, master plans, schematic documents, design development documents, construction documents, and providing construction period services.  Prime contractor should have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm, or team, with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects.  The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Civil Engineer, Geotechnical Engineer, Natural Resources Specialist, Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator, and Architect.  Probable Scope:In accordance with the master plan that was prepared for the entire cemetery property, this project is the first construction phase (Phase I) of a Major initiative which will consolidate the outpatient functions of the St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks Medical Center to a single location, relocate the National Cemetery Administration administrative operations, replace outlying buildings; and ultimately provide 31 acres for Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery expansion, after the completion of Phase V.  Copies of the Master Plan and all associated documents will be provided to the A/E selected for this project.Total development area for Phase I, to be accomplished in two distinct phases, IA and IB, will encompass approximately 13 acres and will be designed utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide.  The design will culminate in the preparation of contract documents and construction specifications to be used for competitive bidding purposes. This land is the first area available for expansion without impact to the Medical Center or its future construction Phases 2, 3 and 4, which are not part of Phase I or Phase V of the National Cemetery projects. Completion of this phase will allow the cemetery to continue operations while the remaining construction phases of the Medical Centers project are executed.  At the discretion of VA, Phase V may be included as part of the scope of this design effort at a later date, and will develop the remaining 18 acres for additional gravesites after completion of the Medical Centers construction activities (Phase 2, 3 and 4).The Phase IA project will demolish three buildings, develop approximately 10 acres located on a portion of the additional 31acres (which does not impact the St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks Medical Center operations or the Medical Centers construction activities), provide roughly 8,250 pre-placed concrete crypts, including access roads, landscaping, irrigation, fencing, site utilities and site furnishings per National Cemetery Administration Design and Operational Standards. Completion of this phase will allow the cemetery to continue operations while the remaining Medical Center construction Phases 2, 3 and 4 are executed.  Phase IB of this project must be closely coordinated with the Medical Centers Phase 2 construction activities.  After the relocation of the Medical Center power substation, primary electrical service and central HVAC plant is completed in the Medical Centers Phase 2, approximately 3 acres will be available for development which will provide approximately 2,113 pre-placed concrete crypts, including; access roads, landscaping, irrigation, fencing, site utilities and site furnishings and thus completes Phase 1. Of primary concern is the Medical Centers Phase 2 construction work which is planned to take place simultaneously with the Phase I National Cemetery project.Phase V will commence after all Medical Center construction activities are completed and will develop the remaining approximate18 acres, provide about 13,314 pre-placed concrete crypts, four columbarium sites totaling roughly 9,100 niches and one committal shelter including; access roads, landscaping, irrigation, fencing, site utilities and site furnishingsThe completed project should be capable of achieving LEED equivalency.  In addition, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected firm shall design to the estimated governments cost for construction.The schematics and design development of Phases IA and IB will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost.  In addition, schematics and design development of Phase V, along with the construction documents and construction period services for Phases IA, IB and V shall be awarded at the option of the government.  In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the cost and scope management capabilities of the applicants.  All design documents must be compatible with VA-CAD format so phasing can be coordinated with the multi-phase Medical Center portion of this project.  Applicants must have an established working office within 150 mile radius of the St. Louis, Missouri area, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work and be licensed in the State of Missouri.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices in the State of Missouri.  No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the VA Cost Estimating and A/E Evaluation Service (00CFM1B, Attention: Robert T. Smoot, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420, five (5) copies are required within 30 days of the date of this advertisement.  A current SF 330 Part II, representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with current SF 330 Part IIs for each proposed consultants office involved.  Applicants will be rated based on the relevant experience - planning and design of projects of similar scale and scope - of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicants capacity to do the work, record of past performance on VA work, geographic consideration, the participation of minority-owned and women-owned consultants and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.  Award of contract is dependent upon the availability of funds. This is not a request for a proposal.If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the small, small disadvantaged and women-owned business contracting goals will be:  28.7% (SB), 5% (SDB), 5% (WOSB), 3% (HUB Zone), 10% (VOSB), and 7% (SDVOSB). Note: The covenant against contingent fee clause is applicable to this pre-solicitation. ***POC Scope: Dan Reilly, 202-461-8934Selection Process: Robert T.

The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Civil Engineer, Natural Resources Specialist, Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator, and Architect.  Probable Scope:In accordance with the master plan that was prepared for the entire cemetery property, this Phase 4 Gravesite Development and Cemetery Improvement project will consume approximately 20 acres of the 206 undeveloped acres remaining at Houston National Cemetery; and, if additional acreage becomes available, VA may request revision of its existing overall cemetery master plan.  This 20-acre Phase 4 Development will be accomplished utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide.  The design will culminate in the preparation of contract documents and construction specifications to be used for competitive bidding purposes.  The Phase 4 Gravesite Development and Cemetery Improvements project, of roughly 20-acres of undeveloped land, will yield a total of approximately 20,500 gravesites including both full-casket and cremain sites.  Since this is an existing cemetery, the project will only incorporate infrastructure improvements needed to support this phase of development.   In addition, this project will include the installation of about 3,500 full-casket pre-placed crypts in existing Section R.

<DESC>This is notice of the Governments intent to negotiate a four (4) month sole source contract modification with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The contract modification will be completed under the current contract DAPC49-02-C-0009, with Shaw Infrastructure, Inc., 1230 Columbia St, Ste 1200, San Diego, CA 92101-8517. The local project office is: Shaw Infrastructure, Inc., P.O. Box 5504, Fort Richardson, AK 99505-0504. Main telephone (907) 384-0182. The current contract expires on 30 November 2008. The original contract was awarded for a base period and four (12 month) option periods and has a current value of $118,070,381. The current contract has services which cover two different Post locations in Alaska, with the two different locations being Fort Richardson and Fort Wainwright. Because of the Base Realignment and stand up of a single Garrison at Fort Wainwright, it was necessary to separate the contract and make two different awards. This extension will allow time for the separate solicitations and award processes to be completed for the Public Works Support Services. One award will cover Fort Richardson and the other award will cover the areas of Fort Wainwright, and all the Army Training Areas, Donnelly, Yukon, and Seward along with any other areas used for training that are not listed here. Each of the new contracts is planned to have a base period and four each(12 month) option periods. The services are to provide all labor, personnel, supervision, material, equipment, tools and transportation necessary to perform the Public Works type services on these areas belonging to the Army Alaska. This includes but is not limited to such work as preventive maintenance, routine and emergency service work orders on facilities and grounds, one-time projects for additional repairs to covered facilities that were not previously identified as recurring requirement, but the nature of the work is within the general nature and scope of the contract and documentation and reports. This is a 15 day notice that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the Army. The Army is preparing to have this period of extension begin on 01 December 2008 and run through 31 March 2009. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Regional Contracting Office will not pay for any information submitted based on this notice. Anyone who has the experience and expertise may submit their related qualifications and technical capabilities to jerry.crocker@us.army.mil and carol.hodgdon@us.army.mil. Capability statements should include the following: details of similar projects, dates of projects, project references (including owner with phone number and email address), and project cost. Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages and shall address the capability to start full operations under a Fixed-Priced type contract on 01 December 2008 without a transition or phase-in period. Responses to this Notice must be received before 3:00 p.m. (Alaska Standard Time) on 18 November 2008. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 561210. Respondents must indicate their business size. All documents submitted shall become the property of the U.S. Government.<BR>

FOOTNOTES:
1 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) defines electronic record management systems as "a system that meets an agency's record keeping needs...an electronic information system in which records are collected, organized, and categorized to facilitate preservation, retrieval, use and disposition (36 CFR 1234.2). An electronic system that will ensure that the records it maintains will have sufficient authenticity and reliability to meet all of the agency's record keeping needs."

2 The DOD’s 5015.2 standard sets minimum functional requirements for ERM applications.  It specifies design criteria needed to identify, mark, store and dispose of electronic records.  Its function is to specify mandatory and optional design requirements that a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product must support before federal organizations could use it. It does not define how agencies manage electronic records or how an ERM program is to be implemented.

The anticipated period of performance for this effort is 12 months from date of award.  Background - The Container Roll On/ Roll Off Platform (CROP) has become the Armys standard means for moving ammunition.  It is a flat platform twenty feet long by eighty-nine inches wide that has a large A-frame on one end.  This A-frame interfaces with a hydraulic lifting mechanism on a Palletized Loading System (PLS) truck or a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck - Load Handling System (HEMTT-LHS), and allows these vehicles to pick up the CROP and its load and pull it up on to its chassis for transport.  The CROP will also fit into a twenty foot International Standards Organization (ISO) container, locking itself in place for shipment on rail, commercial trailer, or ship.  Airlifted ammunition takes too long and costs too much to deliver to soldiers because the Armys Palletized Loading System (PLS) platform, i.e., CROP and truck are not compatible with the Air Force cargo aircraft logistics systems.   The following elements of work are to be performed by the contractor under this Statement of Work (SOW):3.1	Verify/Validate performance requirements for all Intermodal Platforms.Performance Objective:  Contractor will be responsible for providing engineering and technical support for the family of intermodal platforms.

Ms Miers has familiarity with NINR's research mission and its relationship to extramural stakeholders.  She has extensive hours and broad experience with NIH programs and policies.  Her previous NIH appointment with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, afforded her additional opportunities to become familiar with research related to several areas that is of particular interest to NINR; including behavior, prevention, chronic disease, and rehabilitation.  She has developed close collaborations with program directors and with counterparts in other ICs at NIH.  Her recent experience as Assistant Dean for Planning at Columbia University Medical Center included extensive interaction with that institution’s School of Nursing, focusing primarily on research opportunities and educational needs.

The consultant will continue to: Assist and participate in the coordination and updating of the NINR strategic plan, including analysis of currently funded projects and trends, writing and gathering information and recommendations from Institutes staff and advisors.

CIBA is intended to be a collaborative effort with representation from Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies to strategically plan and develop identifier technologies that can meet various environmental/clinical diagnostic acquisition programs.   For this announcement, identification/identifier is defined as the ability to automatically process/prepare and analyze a clinical or environmental sample in order to provide the taxonomic identity at the species level of the bacterium, virus, and toxin of interest contained therein.  This CIBA effort is focused on finding what systems are available that use common analytical platforms that can accept environmental or clinical samples from different sources including air, liquid, and solid matrices.  CIBA is envisioned to combine both nucleic acid detection and non-nucleic acid detection (not limited to conventional methods) for identification supplemented by a field-expedient, semi-automated, or fully automated  sample preparation component.  These systems may be used at a deployable laboratory, high-throughput fixed laboratories, clinical diagnostic facility, or man-portable field units.   Modularity is encouraged in the material solution approach.  Training and operator qualifications are areas for discriminating suitability of candidate systems.  <BR><BR>This RFI seeks submissions that will provide contributions to any or all of the following CIBA functional components: nucleic acid detection, non-nucleic acid detection (proteins/other molecular targets), automated sample preparation, data-fusion, and a communication subsystem module to allow system connectivity to medical/ information reporting systems.

<RESPDATE>120408
<CONTACT>Madeline Y. Baumgartner, Email madeline.baumgartner@socom.mil
<DESC><p><br />1. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a Special Operations Forces (SOF) EC-130J performance enhancement study to meet the requirement for a wideband satellite communications capability. The Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft in this study is the EC-130J Commando Solo III, USSOCOM's airborne Psychological Operations (PSYOP) radio and television broadcast platform. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives, USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.
<p>2. The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or commercially available solutions to the SOF EC-130J requirements for a wideband satellite communications capability, assess technology and manufacturing readiness, and prepare budgetary planning estimates for possible programming initiatives. There are two basic requirements for the aircraft satellite system. First, the system must be capable of receive-only commercial satellite TV (subscription and free to air) through various global markets provided the regional receivers with paid subscription is available. Second, the wideband satellite terminal must be able to send requests for PSYOP products (text, audio, and video), receive the products, and confirm receipt while airborne to a network operations center. The system must be designed with open architecture to allow the use of existing Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GES) and not be restricted or limited to a proprietary waveform or specific satellite service.</p>
<p>3. USSOCOM seeks information from responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed systems integration requirements; can be validated by performance testing, including flight test; require minimum modification or upgrade to aircraft systems; address sustainment concerns. Sources can provide a solution to either commercial satellite TV or the IP based protocol approach, or a system that can do both requirements.</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher. Adaptation of NDI or commercial solutions is encouraged. Recommended solutions must be sustainable through 2025 (or estimated installation year of the USAF FAB-T common terminal?). Key performance parameters include data rates for receiving live streaming full motion video/audio programs for near real-time broadcast (minimum 6 (Threshold) and 10 (Objective) Mbps receive/downlink, minimum 1(T) 3 (O) Mbps transmit/uplink), ability to interface to aircraft's Ethernet Local Area Network, and compatibility with Internet Protocol (IP) based iDirect TDMA ground terminals operating in the Ku (T) and Ka (O) bands. Using a center wing hatch mount ("no scar") antenna solutions is highly preferred, fuselage mount acceptable. The response should provide the minimum look angle of a satellite that will sustain lock with low horizon satellites during a 20 degree (T) or 30 degree (O) bank turn through a 360 degree turn with no more than a 5 second loss of signal or 10 second period of signal pixilation due to wing/tail blockage.</p>
<p>5. Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the required performance enhancement challenges with low integration risk to the SOF EC-130J inventory. Respondents are encouraged to provide information on all or any subset of the areas listed. No adverse evaluation will result from responses, which address only those specific areas applicable to one's core business expertise.</p>
<p>6. Respondents are to use a minimum number of pages to describe in detail the information requested. Limit responses to no more than 25 8 &frac12;" x 11" single sided pages, including attachments, figures and/or drawings.</p>
<p>7. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for possible uses of platforms within the military. Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and protected as such. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p><br />Special Note: Respondent's attention is directed to the fact that contractor consultant and advisors to the Government will review and provide support during evaluation of submittals. When appropriate, non-government advisors may be used to objectively review a particular functional area and provide comments and recommendations to the Government. All advisors shall comply with procurement integrity laws and shall sign Non-Disclosure and Rules of Conduct/Conflict of Interest statements. The Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding conflicts of interest and ensure advisors comply with safeguarding proprietary data. Submissions in response to this RFI constitutes approval to release the submittal to Government Support Contractors.</p>
<p>8. U.S. and non-U.S. firms with appropriate Export Control status are permitted to respond to this RFI. Responses to questions from authorized interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response. One-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are currently not contemplated. If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to those responders that meet the requirements contained in this RFI. The purpose would be to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.</p>
<p>9. Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997): The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Although the terms "proposal" and "respondent" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal. Any proposed solution must meet all Operational, Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) requirements mandated by the Department of Defense.</p>

<DESC>The Postal Service intends to award one or more Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC) to implement, and assist in executing a National Elevator Inspection Program within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The offeror shall have the capability to perform the services requested at multiple locations at or pertaining to Postal Service facilities as directed by the Postal Service.  The Postal Service has an estimated 1,600 assets nationwide requiring these services.  An indefinite quantity contract is a contract pursuant to which the contractor will perform a series of individual projects at different Postal Service facilities. The quantities specified in this contract are not purchased until ordered. Delivery or performance must be as directed in work orders issued in accordance with the Work Order clause and the contract schedule.  The supplier must furnish to the Postal Service, when ordered, the services specified in this contract up to and including the quantity designated as the Total Contract Value.  There is no minimum order required under this contract. The contractor may be required to work on multiple Work Orders at different locations during the same time frame.  The term of the contracts will be for two years; there will be four possible two-year renewal options. The cost per inspection is expected to remain relatively constant while the travel cost may vary widely from site to site.  The successful bidder is expected to develop a solution that will minimize those travel costs.  Inspection activities may occur in operational mail-handling facilities (possibly 24 hours per day/7 days per week operations) and in such cases, inspection activities must not interfere with postal operations.  Since this is an expedited procurement we will first evaluate the companies Qualification Packages, and then evaluate the Management Plan and the Cost Proposal in that order.  The Contract award will be based on a Best Value Selection.  Only the ten (10) current Independent Elevator Inspection Services Companies on the GSA Schedule are invited to participate. They are; Bayline Lift Technologies, LLC (800)398-8862, BMAR & Associates, LLC (270) 885-4642, Elevator Consulting & Design (303) 693-4649, Elevator Solutions LLC (505) 877-9715, Emcor Government Services, Inc. (703) 769-1853, Gannett Fleming (717) 763-7549, Lerch Bates Inc. (303) 795-7956, National Elevator Inspection Ser (800) 866-6347,x3101, Omni Elevator, Inc. (410) 521-3200, SETEC, Inc (817) 831-3330.  Any additional information can be obtained by contacting James Fisher at james.a.fisher@usps.gov .  The due date for submissions is December 1, 2008 at 3:00PM EST.

6. Dedicated eCopy representative and eCopy trained systems engineers. The offerror will provide maintenance and support (purchased by the Government at installation), for the remaining term of the M&S agreements that are currently in effect at no additional cost.

7. Network integration and training at no charge for initial installations and troubleshooting during the life cycle of the equipment. Dedicated hardware and software, Canon -pecific trained technical systems engineers are included.

8. Meter readings are submitted through an interactive interface or through a simple Microsoft Excel-based bulk upload interface reducing the OS workload for color copiers.

20. Consistent technical staff/hardware and software - Canon specific trained.

QUOTATION EVALUATION/ CONTRACT AWARD

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition: (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation.

The following standards must be adhered to for optimum performance of copiers which support the Administration on Aging:

1.  Flat rate monthly charge for unlimited black & white copies - the flat rate maintenance plan will accommodate the migration of stand alone printers to multi-functional devices; supporting a Departmental directive. Printing with stand alone printers is costing .01 to .50 per page based on black and white or color production. Flat rate maintenance will allow printing at “no cost” to AOA for black and white production along with a generous color allowance. 

2.   Provide Canon imageWare Enterprise Management Console at no additional cost. This internet portal allows AOA to actively monitor the status of all Canon multifunction devices within the DHHS network in real-time. This includes viewing service histories as well as monitoring the status of staples, toner, paper, network connection, and meter readings.

3.  Provide webcasts for training to update the AOA on systems and software changes and to be fully apprised of all other technical requirements at no additional charge.

4.  Fully support the present life guarantee replacement cycle warranty. Within three years of original installation of any newly installed Canon brand equipment or throughout the term of Canon leased equipment, the offerror will, at the Government’s request replace such equipment with a like unit if the following three conditions are met: (1) the equipment is continuously under a Canon maintenance agreement from the date of installation; (2) all terms of the Canon maintenance agreement applicable to the Government are fulfilled; and (3) prior to requesting a replacement “like for like” unit, the offerror is given a reasonable opportunity to cure any service problems with the equipment.

5.  Authorized Canon service providers which utilizes only Canon genuine parts for service and replacements. Many of the listed copiers are currently under lease from Canon Business Solutions, Inc. The maintenance by certified Canon technicians on Canon equipment insures the continuation of the warranty agreement on leased Canon equipment. NOTE: The warranty shall be void and of no force and effect if the copier is damaged as a result of repair by other than service representatives qualified by Canon U.S.A. and acting in accordance with Canon U.S.A.’s service bulletins.  This will also ensure that all integrated multifunctional, digital solutions incorporating eCopy (Canon partner) will continue to address the workflow requirements of the AOA customers.

 
6.  Dedicated eCopy representative and eCopy trained systems engineers. Approximately 30 percent of the copiers listed in the RFQ were installed with eCopy hardware and software. The offerror will provide maintenance and support (purchased by the Government at installation), for the remaining term of the M&S agreements that are currently in effect at no additional cost. The offerror will provide the Government with customer references that have both Washington DC and National coverage with eCopy installed. The offerror will provide their systems engineer support infrastructure for eCopy to include systems engineers and certifications and years of experience for supporting eCopy installations.

7.  Network integration and training at no charge for initial installations and troubleshooting during the life cycle of the equipment. Dedicated hardware and software, Canon specific trained technical systems engineers are included.

8.  Meter readings are submitted through an interactive interface or through a simple Microsoft Excel-based bulk upload interface reducing the AOA workload.

13.  One (1) extra toner per machine, per location.

14.  No pre-maintenance inspections are allowed.

15.  Service which resolves network integration issues remotely at no additional charge if they appear related to the copier’s connectivity, specifically the print board or eCopy scanning functionality.

16.  If AOA elects to add additional accessories, there is no increase in service pricing.

17.  Practices with document encryption, security and authentication with a senior staff of senior system engineers for pre-sales activity and consultation.

 
18.  Validate device types, id install locations, and access account information and account submission of service and supply requests through an internet based account management application at no additional charge.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africa’s longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than two (2) million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than four (4) million people within Sudan—the largest internally displaced person (IDP) population in the world.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, Western Sudan when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 2.6 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including 1.9 million IDPs and 220,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population.

DCHA staff in Sudan work as part of the USAID Mission in Sudan.  DCHA staff in Khartoum include representatives from OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI).  The OFDA Country Representative (OCR) may be assigned to Khartoum, Juba, other parts of Sudan, or the region, depending on needs.  The OCR is responsible for the coordination of OFDA relief, rehabilitation and transition programs in Sudan.  He/She serves as the highest level decision maker in Sudan on U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance in Sudan.

OBJECTIVE

The position of OFDA Country Representative for Sudan is required in order to meet management and program objectives for Sudan.  He/She will be responsible for planning, developing, and directing OFDA’s humanitarian assistance response programs in Sudan.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

•	Direct the OFDA Sudan field team in assessment of needs, identification of target groups and relief requirements, and establishing priorities and timetables for humanitarian assistance;

•	Provide the foreign affairs community with up-to-date and accurate reporting on humanitarian relief conditions and operations;
•	Guide the network process of situation reporting, ensuring the timely collection of information by the Sudan Information Officer(s) on conditions and operations in Sudan for regular and special situation reports, which are submitted to OFDA and distributed widely as a reliable summary source for the status of humanitarian assistance activities;
•	Ensure that the Sudan Regional Coordinator is kept apprised of all relevant developments in Sudan, including programs, team administration, and security;
•	Assess and monitor the security situation in Khartoum and the field on a continuous basis;
•	Coordinate with the RSO and exercise final responsibility for the safety and security of all staff members including deployments to the field, physical security of residential and office compounds, field travel, emergency evacuation plans and determine when to remove staff from dangerous or potentially dangerous situations.

•	Ensure the proper use and care of USG property assigned to OFDA Sudan;
•	If directed by OFDA/W, monitor the humanitarian situation in eastern Chad and provide recommendations to OFDA/W on OFDA strategy, programs and staffing for East Chad;
•	Operate OFDA communications and data processing equipment, including satellite telephones, cellular type mobile phones, and hand held radios;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Management, Sustainable Infrastructure, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDPs intent to competitively fund research and development for innovative and new environmental technologies that meet the focus areas set forth in the SERDP Announcement. The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions can be found on the DoD SERDP web site at www.serdp.org/funding/core-nonfed. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Before preparing a pre-proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the SERDP Announcement for details regarding proposal submission requirements, the evaluation of proposals, and the individual Statements of Need (SON). Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.<BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the instructions on the SERDP web site at www.serdp.org/funding/core-nonfed, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, January 8, 2009. No electronic mail or faxed copies will be accepted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the web site at https://sems.serdp-estcp.org in the format specified in the Instructions. <BR><BR>Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the DoD SERDP web site. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It is expected that awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will result depending on availability of funds. Pre-proposal and full proposal submissions will be evaluated against the factors noted in the instructions. If the initial project is successful, the proposer may be eligible for follow-on funding.<BR> <BR>For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $550,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office web site at http://www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb/ provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  If follow on work is requested after an initial proposal, a subcontracting plan would also be required. The HECSA point of contact for non-technical issues is Ms. Alandra Jones, 703-428-6551 and for the subcontracting plan is Ms. Kimberli Gray, 703-428-7385.  The point of contact for this BAA for technical issues is Ms. Jina Saunders, SERDP Office, 703-696-2127.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING SET-ASIDE FOR TOTAL HUBZONE BUSINESS CONCERNS. 


The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concern, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSB), or Small Business Concerns. Estimated construction price range is between $250,000 and $500,000.  Performance period is 60 calendar days.  The applicable North American Industry Class System (NAICS) 2007 code is 236220.  The small business size standard is $31.0 M.  Bid, payment and performance bonds are required.
The project work location is at U.S. Coast Guard site USCG Air Station Clearwater, Pinellas County, Florida. The project work includes but not limited to; removal/replacement of gypsum wallboard, carpeting system, and suspended ceiling system at the Naval Operational Support Command (NOSC) Building. Work also includes adding two ductless mini split air-conditioning systems to a computer frame room and telecom room, relocating and adding supply and return diffusers and registers, relocating mains, adding branch lines, and relocating and adding pendant sprinklers to provide proper coverage and water density in accordance  with new hydraulic calculations. The solicitation in its entirety and any amendments will be available at no charge online at http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the above solicitation number. At the present time, this acquisition is expected to be issued as a Small Business set aside. However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HubZone certified or 19.1404, if your firm is SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Odalys.McGee@uscg.mil or by fax at (305)-278-6696. In the response please include the following: (a) a positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers. At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside or SDVOSB Small Business, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-Aside or 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns. Your response is required by October 23, 2008.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a small business set-aside.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone or SDVOSB small business set aside, or a Small Business set aside, will be posted on the FedBizOps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.
