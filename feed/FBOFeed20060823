<DESC>CDC, National Center for Infection Diseases (NCID), Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases (DVRD) has developed a number of rapid assays for the diagnosis of orthopoxviruses, specifically to rule out smallpox.  The Real-Time PCR assay has been developed for this purpose, utilizing a number of platforms.  Now that the protocol has been validated for all platforms, it is of vital importance that these assays be usable in a “field” situation.   Most of the equipment used in the lab is not feasible to take out into the field, due to it’s size, weight and power requirements.   We need a fully integrated real-time PCR system that has the capaiblity to be easily transported with a cartidge system that would reduce the risk of external contamination during sample preparation.  Instruments having glass accessories are not desired.   Through market research,  the GeneXpert System (GX4000N3-3), GeneXpert cartridges and diagnostic software developed by Cypheid, Inc. is the only system known to meet our needs.  This equipment is designed to take into the field for outbreak situations and EPI studies. This instrument is fully integrated real-time PCR system that includes a complete on-board nucleic acid purification system and real-time PCR tube in a compact, programmable cartridge. The system utilizes proprietary dried reagant technology for ambient temperature stability and precision microfluidics-based reagant reconstitution. The instrument is capable of being configured with as few as 1 or as many as 16 samples independently programmable sample processing sites.  This notice announces our intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA as the only known system meeting our size, weight, power and voltage needs which does not utilize glass accessories.  All responsible sources may submit a quote for equipment meeting our stated needs to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the synopsis.  All quotes  shall be considered by the agency.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Please address all inquiries/quotes to Denise Rains, CDC PGO,  315 East Montgomery Ave., Spokane, WA 99207 or call (509)354-8111, fax (509)354-8099 or e-mail dgr8@cdc.gov.  Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) @ www.ccr.gov. This acquisition is being processed under FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Regulations.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health National Eye Institute (NEI) has a requirement for Scientific Study to Research and Ascertain samples and conduct on-going collaborative study regarding families with a recessive form of Retinitis Pigmentosa.  To the best of the Government's knowledge the CTR for Excellence in Molecular Biology, University of Punjas, 87 W Canal Baum Lahore, 53700 Pakistan, is the only source that has the unique capability of performing the services because this study shall be performed in Pakistan where the population is approximately one hundred and forty (140 million with poor medical infrastructure).  This service is commercially available.

1.	The contractor shall conduct an on-going collaborative study regarding families with a recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa  This study shall be performed in Pakistan where the population is approximately one hundred and forty (140) million with poor medical infrastructure.  
2.	The contractor shall research a large number of families in Pakistan where many of their members have been diagnosed with a recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa.  
3.	The contractor shall uniquely identify the genetic effects causing recessive retinitis pigmentosa in the Pakistan communities because of their consanguinity.  This study shall be carried out in three (3) stages, each independent of the other, to include, but shall not be limited to the following:
a.	The initial stage shall be carried out in 3-4 months, consisting of the collection of at least twenty (20) families.  
b.	The second stage shall be carried out in 3-4 months, consisting of the collection of at least fifteen (15) families.
c.	The third stage shall be carried out over the remainder of the first (1st) year, and shall consist of recruitment of the remaining fifteen (15) families.
4.	The contractor shall screen, clinically evaluate and gather the necessary data and other research on the recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa and forward this data to the NEI.  This information shall include, but shall not be limited to, genetic materials, and detailed records on his/her research on data from affected and unaffected families.  
5.	The National Eye Institute (NEI) does not have the resources necessary to conduct on-site evaluations and develop family pedigrees, therefore, the contractor shall have a M.D.or Ph.D. degree, and specialized training and experience of at least twenty (20) years in the molecular genetics of retinal degenerations, and at least ten (10) years of working with NIH in that field.
6.	The contractor shall be responsible for the conduct of on-site assessments of families with a history of hereditary cataract.
7.	In order to perform the research of recessive retinitis pigmentosa, the contractor shall have access to a fully equipped and appropriately staffed eye clinic in Pakistan. 
8.	The contractor shall have the initial assessments of samples collected from each family with respect to linkage to genetic loci known to be associated with retinitis pignerosa to hereditary cataract.  This assessment shall consist of genotyping using markers in proximity to known autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa loci or cataract.
9.	Samples obtained from patients shall be used by the contractor as well as NEI.
10.	The contractor shall train at NIH in the NEI, as a Fogarty Fellow, and shall have the option of analyzing the samples collected in Pakistan or on another project mutually agreeable to all parties.
11.	The contractor shall meet deliverables of samples from each family and send either as a hardcopy, or an electronic file, to include, but shall not be limited to the following:
a.	A completed pedigree drawn either by hand or with a computerized program.
b.	Completed history and examination forms describing the clinical findings.
c.	Copies of any laboratory results available at that time such as original data, AE exported text files, or linkage prefiles or results.
12.	The contractor shall provide a report at the time of completion on genotyping data and/or linkage results of the initial screen for known autosomal recessive RP loci.
13.	The contractor shall provide a report on publications arising from this project, and decisions regarding publication and authorship shall be by mutual agreement.
14.	Before the initiation of sample collections, the contractor shall submit paperwork sufficient to demonstrate an existing FWE with the National Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology at the University of the Punjab. This paperwork is required by the NEI Institutional Review Board, and the NIH Office of Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
15.	The government will supply oligonucleotide primers for this testing, and any additional analysis agreed to by both parties.
16.	The period of performance shall be for two (2) months after date of award. 
The NEI request the services of a contractor, who must have a M. D. or Ph.D. degree and specialized training and experience of at least twenty (20) years in the medical genetics of retinal degenerations.  The Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology was established by the Pakistan Federal Ministry of Education as a premier teaching and research institution in molecular biology.  The Centre represents one of the best places for molecular biological research in this part of the world.  There are  three (3) other institutes/laboratories engaged in molecular biological work, however, none of them are doing research comparable in scope and quality to that being pursued at the Centre. 

This is not a request for competitive quotations.

<DESC>The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Business Services is contemplating negotiating a sole source contract with Dillon Aero Inc., Scottsdale Arizona, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(4)(c). The Office of Business Services anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source. This is predicated upon substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Dillon Aero is the exclusive manufacture for the M134D 7.62mm and owns the patent on the clutch/feeder/delinker, a critical requirement for the use of the M134D.  Therefore, Dillon Aero is the only contractor that can provide the specific weapon required by NNSA Y-12. The applicable NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 332994 with a size standard of 1,000. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by September 8, 2006, 4:00 P.M. (MST), to Ms Maria Aurora Vigil, Contract Specialist, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Business Services, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185; or by E-mail at mvigil@doeal.gov.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No reimbursement for any costs connect with providing capability information will be provided by NNSA.

<DESC>HQ 77th Aeronautical Systems Group
Patient Isolation Unit (PIU) Acquisition
Pre-Solicitation Synopsis 
23 Aug 2006

THIS IS THE FORMAL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204.

HQ 77th Aeronautical Systems Group (77 AESG/PSK), Brooks City-Base, Texas, in support of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), the lead command in Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Patient Isolation Unit (PIU) Program.  The purpose of the PIU program is to conduct Research, Development, Testing & Evaluation (RDT&E) for a PIU that will effectively isolate contagious patients while in the AE system and concurrently meet the requirements outlined in the Capabilities Development Document (CDD). 

The PIU Key Performance Parameters (KPP) include:

KPP #1. FDA Approval.  The PIU must meet FDA 510K approval requirements prior to being utilized (Threshold=Objective). Rationale: PIU must meet FDA's CDRH requirements for 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E, 21 CFR Part 814, 21 CFR Part 812, 21 CFR Part 807, 21 CFR Part 820, CFR Part 801, 21 CFR Part 803, and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002.  The PIU has been determined by FDA standards as a "Class II" medical device.
KPP #2. Force Protection, Joint Operations Concept (JOpsC) Key Characteristic.  Pathogen Passage Requirements. Prevent 99.97% passage of particulates 0.3 microns or greater in size per CDC (Threshold=Objective).  Rationale:  PIU System must prevent passage of infectious biological agents per National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The primary purpose of the PIU is to prevent the spread of infectious biological pathogens. The ability for the unit to either prevent the spread of contagious pathogens from the unit to the outside environment. (Ref. Primary Containment for Biohazards:  Biological Safety Cabinets, CDC/NIH) Filtration system must meet CDC standards IAW MMWR (RR13; 1-132), 28 Oct1994.

KPP #3.  Safe to Fly.  The unit must obtain safe-to-fly approval for one AE MAF-capable aircraft (C-17, C-130, KC-135, and KC-10) and the H-60 rotor wing aircraft (Threshold).  The unit must obtain safe-to-fly approval for all AE aircraft and can be used on other transportation platforms (Objective).  Rationale: AFTTP 3-42.5, Nov 2003, "Aeromedical Evacuation" established the doctrine of using any AE capable MAF platform versus requiring dedicated single purpose AE aircraft (i.e. C-9 Nightingale, etc.)  The PIU must meet Airworthiness Certification (AWC) requirements IAW MIL-STD-810F, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests, 1 Jan 2001.  In addition to AWC, the PIU must meet individual aircraft SPO safe-to-fly criteria.

KPP #4. Aircraft Modifications.  The unit will not require any modifications to existing airframes. (Threshold=Objective)  Rationale:  To expeditiously meet the user's requirements, no modifications to existing airframes shall be required as a result of using the PIU.  
 
Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements.  We contemplate issuing one contract with multiple pricing arrangements including Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for the development phase, and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for the production effort.  We anticipate awarding one contract under full and open competition.  The classification code is 65, medical, dental and veterinary equipment. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 326199 with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility as a small business.  

Terms of contract include a seven month development effort, with three additional one-year options for production.  The first year option will be for eleven units; second and third year options will be for seven units each.

We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 22 Sep 2006.  The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps. We also anticipate releasing a draft RFP on or about 08 Sep 2006.

<DESC>PROJECT:				Calexico-West Border Station, Calexico, California
PROJECT TYPE:			Expansion/Renovation
CLIENT AGENCY:			Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Customs & Border Protection (CBP) 

SIZE:  The proposed development includes demolition, realignment, relocation, renovation, and new construction.  The Main administration building will be renovated or replaced.  The traffic control Head House will be relocated and replaced with a new building.  Primary and Secondary Inspection stations will be relocated and replaced.  Other existing facilities will either be demolished or replaced.  The existing New River crossing the property, considered to be contaminating the project site, will be contained.  Most importantly, the two-way flow of traffic through the border station will be realigned, expanded, and optimized.

BUDGET:		$80 to $100 Million Construction Range 
FUNDING:				Funds Are Not Currently Available
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:	At least 35% of the level of contract effort must be perfomed in the State of California
SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE:	XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal facilities of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees and visitors; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service). As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The facility will be designed in metric units.  The project will be LEED certified. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Calexico-West Border Station project will expand and renovate the existing land port of entry located on the United States border with Mexico in the state of California. The proposed site is located in the heart of Calexico/Mexicali bi-national metropolis along the United States/Mexico border, 95 miles east of San Diego, California, and 50 miles west of Yuma, Arizona.   The Calexico-West Border Station, a significant gateway to the United States, will transform an existing obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art port of entry. The new border should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America.   The project delivery method will be Traditional Design-Bid-Build.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of work is to provide professional design services for the Calexico-West Border Station Expansion/Renovation project.  At a minimum, the scope will include architectural design, systems engineering, traffic engineering, safety engineering, security engineering, interior design, landscape design, and related consulting services for the project.  The deliverables shall include all that is needed to enable the construction contractor successfully understand the project, its design, and its construction requirements.  At the beginning of the design-services, the Lead Designer and A/E Team shall present to the Government its intended design approach for the handling of design, engineering, and construction of the project.  During the design services, deliverables shall include concept design documents, design development documents, metric construction documents (METRIC IS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT), specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, computer-aided design (CAD) documents, building information modeling (BIM—for all projects receiving design funding in FY07 and beyond, GSA requires spatial program building information models as a minimum requirement for submissions to the Office of the Chief Architect for final concept approvals by the PBS Commissioner; GSA supports the use in all projects of mature 3D-4D-BIM technologies—spatial program validation and beyond—at strategic project phases in support of specific project challenges) and optional post-construction contract services (PCCS).  

The project proposes to change the existing Calexico-West Border Station, through a series of demolition, renovation, and major expansion work, to create a modern, secure, and energy efficient port of entry.  The Calexico-West Border Station is currently dedicated to the inspection of passenger occupied vehicles and pedestrians crossing the border.  Commercial vehicle traffic is handled by Calexico-East Border Station, located approximately 6.5 miles east of Calexico-West Border Station.  Close to 35,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians cross the border in both directions each day.  The number of existing inspection booths is insufficient to adequately serve the current daily border traffic.  

The Calexico-West Border Station comprises three separate parcels of federal government-owned properties: (1) the Old Custom House site; (2) the Main Building site; and (3) the vacated 14-acre site referred to as the “Commercial Port-of-Entry”.  The Old Custom House is used for the administrative functions of the Department of Homeland Security-Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS-CIS).  The Main Building houses the central operational functions of the port of entry.  The vacated Commercial Port of Entry has several minor structures and is being utilized as temporary parking lot for federal employees.  A private commercial property separates the old Custom House and the Main Building.  A railroad track right-of-way with multiple tracks separates the Main Building from the vacated Port of Entry.  The railroad track serves a cross-border freight train that runs at least twice a day.  The Old Custom House, which is listed on the Federal Register of Historic Places, will be divested through regular government disposal process. The Main Building is an elevated two-story structure with a mezzanine, and it will be renovated and retained for pedestrian traffic control.  The 14-acre vacated Commercial Port of Entry site contains a truck building and a modular trailer, both of which will be demolished in order to develop the site.  The site will be developed for processing non-commercial passenger vehicles inspection.  The site will house a proposed new building complex called the Headhouse, primary and secondary inspection areas, and other facilities required for expanded operation.  Two additional properties, privately owned, are considered for acquisition and inclusion in the project.  A stream of polluted water called New River runs along the western edge of the Calexico Border Station.  A culvert to contain the river from contaminating the U.S. is planned and will be considered in the project design.

The Calexico-West Border Station primarily serves the local communities and the surrounding region on both sides of the border, therefore community interest in the project will be strong.  The border station will remain in operation throughout the construction phase of the project.  Prior to the final design, a substantial amount of comparative design analysis will be required to determine the most efficient and least costly northbound/southbound routing of major roads through the border station.  Secondary roads, walkways, material handling docks, staging areas, and river containment must also be addressed in the design of the project.  

The government-estimated total construction cost for the project is in the range of $80,000,000 to $100,000,000.  The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately five years after the date of the design services contract award.  The Firm Fixed Price base for the Architect-Engineer Design Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept phases for the Calexico-West Border Station Project advertised here.  Options will be priced separately.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the additional work identified as options.  The scope of the Architect-Engineer Design Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract may include options for additional work such as: Pre-design services including special studies, site-surveys, site investigation, schematics design, design development, preparation of CAD working drawings (DO NOT WANT TO REQUIRE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE), and contract documents, specifications, estimating services, value engineering, post-construction award services, metric conversion,  and other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.  

All facilities, existing and new, incorporated in the design, shall conform to the latest IBC, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements (POE ARE EXEMPT FROM BLAST MITIGATION AND PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE REQUIREMENTS), utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).  Provisions for 3D-4D Building Information Modeling (BIM) shall be provided.  The facilities shall also respond to the need to reduce energy consumption, and achieve an acceptable level of green sustainability through LEED Silver certification.  The project is also to meet the appropriate federal design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service); EPACT 2005 compliance; and customer agency requirements, including the U.S. Land Port of Entry Design Guide,

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source, commercial item contract with Compro , 105 East Drive, Melbourne, Florida, 32904 under the authority of FAR6.302-1(b)(2).  The title of the project is ?simulator computer system Replacement?  This procurement seeks to establish a sole-source contract with Compro Computer Services, Inc., to replace the real-time computer systems associated with the Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) simulator.  The B&W simulator was originally delivered with Encore (now Compro) 32/55 computer systems.  NRC engineers later replaced the computer systems with a Compro 32/9780 computer system, and still later with two Compro RSX computer systems. This procurement seeks to replace the RSX computer systems and associated interface hardware with systems capable of emulating the existing RSX installation.The real-time computer systems run under the proprietary, unique Compro MPX-32 operating system.  There are no other operating systems that can run on these computers, nor can the MPX-32 operating system run on computers manufactured by any other computer manufacturer.  The modeling software makes extensive use of the MPX-32 operating system.  Compro is the sole supplier of the MPX-32 operating system. The simulation software was developed and designed for execution on Compro computers using the Compro instruction set.  The simulation software is written in Compro Assembly Language, a mnemonic form of the Compro machine language, and thus cannot be recompiled for execution on a CPU from another manufacturer.  Compro shall provide and install replacement computer systems for the existing Compro RSX computer systems associated with the B&W nuclear power plant simulator.  The replacement system shall be capable of executing the Compro MPX-32 operating system and the simulation software.  The replacement system shall be capable of communicating with the existing simulator I/O system.  Compro will provide software that enables the replacement computer system to emulate the Compro RSX computer system (the emulated environment).  The emulated environment shall be capable of running the MPX-32 operating system and existing, unmodified simulator code. In addition, Compro will provide one year of total system support, to include on-site repair or replacement of failed components, any updates to software provided under this contract that may be developed by the Contractor, and replacement of contractor-provided hardware components that become obsolete during the performance period of this contract. Contractor shall provide, as separate options, and additional four years of total system support.  The NRC intends to award a firm fixed price contract for one year with four one-year options for a total estimated period of performance of five years.  No solicitation document exists. The procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12. Interested firms should submit written responses that provide evidence of the respondent?s capability to perform the required services to the U.S. NRC, Attention: Sharlene McCubbin, Contract Specialist, 11545 Rockville Pike, Room T-7-I2, Rockville MD 20852, no later than September 5, 2006.  Capability statements that do not demonstrate evidence of the respondent?s ability to provide these services will not be considered.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-06-R-5022 for the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts to provide engineering services support to SPAWARSYSCEN for research and development of C4ISR and information systems, technologies, and capabilities.  Specific effort shall include life cycle support of the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) and Information Systems and Technologies including:  research, systems and software design and development, interface design and development, systems integration, test, and interoperability, test and evaluation, analysis and assessment, technology transition, installation, training and exercise support, operation and maintenance, configuration management, and quality assurance. This contract shall also provide M&S and Information systems compatibility, integration, and interoperability with current and emerging (next generation) command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. This contract applies to the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and related Information Systems (IS) products of all CBD Joint Project Managers (JPMs). This includes the JPM IS family of products (including prototypes and experiments) and systems (including fielding and support services), including the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), the Joint Effects Model (JEM), the Joint Operational Effects Federation (JOEF), the Joint Total Assets Visibility and Reporting Warehouse (JTAVRW), the JWARN Integration Capability (JIC), Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) Shared Web-enabled Common Operational Picture (WebCOP) pilots, and the Software Support Activity (SSA). Also, the contract applies to the related AT/FP family of products (including prototypes and experiments) and systems (including fielding and support services).    Work will require compliance with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for the system life-cycle process.

[Information on the SEI CMMI and its practices may be found at the SSC SD Systems Engineering Process Office (SEPO) web site: http://sepo.spawar.navy.mil/.] Awardees of contracts under this RFP will compete for task orders to perform the actual work. Each contract will be awarded for the entire estimated level- of-effort specified in the RFP; however, the competition of task orders may reduce each awardees actual total effort to a level significantly below the ceiling value of each award. The estimated level of effort for the planned period of performance of five years (including options) is 300,000 hours. This is a full and open competition, anticipated to result in the award of an estimated two to five contracts. Small Businesses (SB) are especially encouraged to submit proposals as prime contractors. The Government desires to issue one or more awards to SBs. The NAICS codes for this procurement are 541512 and 541519. There is not an incumbent contractor. A Bidders Mailing List will not be established and hard copies of documents will not be provided. The solicitation will only be available electronically on the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command E-Commerce Web Page at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC San Diego - Open Solicitations.

<ARCHDATE>08232007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for two pasture facilities to maintain up to 1,500 wild horses each, from around November 1, 2006 through October 31, 2007, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located west of the Mississippi River. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: a. Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land. b. 	The purpose of this contract is to obtain a facility (located west of the Mississippi River), to pasture a maximum of 1,500 (plus or minus) head of horses.  The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.  During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses will be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis. It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. c. On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This will require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. d. The Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of two contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 1,500 wild horses, or one contract with the capacity of 3,000 wild horses) resulting from this Request for Proposals (RFP) for a long term wild horse holding facility located west of the Mississippi.  The contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facility must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once the facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. e. Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. Objectives - To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition;To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals;To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals;	To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services - The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks.  Specific requirements are set forth as follows: Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a maximum of 1,500 or 3,000 wild horses (mares and geldings) grazing in pastures.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures;Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis;Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility;Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition;Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment; Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw blood samples for horses prior to shipment; Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations; Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI;	Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. Specific Services - Handling and Gathering - In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups; All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling; Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices; Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather. The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained separate in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment. Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facility to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment; The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR060253, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about September 6, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: Statistical Issues in Dietary Surveillance and Nutritional Epidemiology with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard
Winston-Salem, NC 27157.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requirement is to increase the precision of dietary intake estimates by improving self-report of dietary intake and the analytic procedures for processing reported information. This work is designed to facilitate the National Cancer Institute?s ongoing monitoring and nutritional epidemiology efforts and to advance the understanding of the relationships between diet and cancer outcomes.  A major NCI initiative for improving the analyses of self-reported dietary information involves developing and testing a new method for estimating usual intakes.  The improved procedure (called the NCI Method) is based on the work by researchers at Wake Forest University and uses a nonlinear mixed effects model to estimate/predict 24-hour recall intake based on covariate information.

Requirements: Task 1: Improve understanding of new analytic procedures for estimation of usual intake: Contractor shall: 1) Investigate the use of the Bootstrap to estimate the variance of estimated quantities, CDF values, and distributional moments for usual intake distributions of nutrients and foods, where the NCI method is used to estimate the distributions of usual intake from 24HR data collected under simple random sampling (SRS).  The variance estimation method must properly account for variance associated with model fitting and the underlying distribution of covariates used in the modeling and 2) Investigate the gain in precision attributable to the use of the NCI method for usual intake estimation over the use of alternative usual intake estimates such as the simple individual mean. The investigation shall cover the estimation of usual nutrient intake distributions (especially for subpopulations defined by covariates.

Task 2: Evaluate methods used to identify under-reporters:  Contractor shall: 1) Conduct analyses that explore the relationship between the Goldberg equation and total energy expenditure obtained from doubly labeled water in estimating misreporting of self-report measures of energy intake using data from the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study.

The researchers at Wake Forest University are uniquely qualified to perform the services required.  Wake Forest University developed and owns the software methodology of the NCI method and provided its first software implementation.  They are involved with several important data sets that have been used for development and validation of the NCI method, namely the Eating at Americas Table Study, the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition study and the 2001-2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which will be used extensively to carry out the aforementioned services.   In summary, researchers at Wake Forest University have the background knowledge and expertise which is not readily available within the research community.  

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 8, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Solexa, Inc., 25861 Industrial Blvd., Hayward, CA 94545-2991.  This purchase is to provide Clonal Single Molecule Array (CSMA) Sequencing for gene expression analysis.  While there are other companies that manufacture products and provide services that enable researchers to conduct gene expression profiling, using different technology platforms only Solexa delivers comprehensive transcriptome analysis and counts all mRNAs in a sample through the generation of signature sequence for each transcript.  Their Clonal Single Molecule Array (CSMA) and Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS) with Reversible Terminator Chemistry Technologies generates sequence-based genome-wide expression profiles of any transcript, form any gene, in any species without the need for prior knowledge of the species transcriptome and permits the expression analysis of organisms with poorly annotated genomes, as well as for discovery of novel transcripts in well-annotated genomes.  Solexa is able to measure expression changes by sequencing more than one million tags derived from a single sample and provides greater confidence to researchers.  The features and protocols offered by Solexa are unique and presents unlimited dynamic range for understanding up or down regulation of genes.  An award to any other source would affect the Institute?s anticipated outcome and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the Size Standard is $6.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), funds a comprehensive portfolio of grant and contract resources to discover and develop novel agents for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS-associated opportunistic pathogens, including tuberculosis.  Investigators at academic institutions and small biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies who identify new therapeutic or prevention agents frequently do not have the expertise or financial resources to conduct many of the additional studies needed to convert promising leads into pharmaceutical agents suitable for Phase I clinical evaluation.  To facilitate further development of promising leads, DAIDS supports a portfolio of in vitro, animal model, and drug development contracts to assist these investigators by providing the pharmaceutical-grade materials and preclinical data needed to support submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Several contracts in this research and development portfolio are being recompeted for award in fiscal year 2007, including:  (a) Tissue-based Small Animal Model for HIV Drug Discovery; (b) Pharmaceutical and Chemical Resources for AIDS Drug Development; (c) Safety Evaluation of Anti-AIDS Agents; and (d) Management of Information Resources for AIDS Drugs.  Through this Request for Proposals (RFP), DAIDS is recompeting contracts for the development and conduct of in vitro assays to assess the potential of drug substances for further development as anti-HIV agents.  Proposals are solicited in two distinct areas, each to result in the award of a separate contract:

Part A:  Confirmatory In Vitro Evaluations of HIV Therapeutics
Part B:  Specialized In Vitro Virological Assays for HIV Therapeutics and Topical Microbicides

Proposals may be submitted for Part A alone, Part B alone, or both Part A and Part B; however, separate Technical and Business Proposals are required for each part.    Any proposal which combines both Part A and Part B will be returned to the Offeror without review or further consideration.  If an Offeror is awarded both Part A and Part B, NIAID will consider merging the two awards into a single contract.

PART A: CONFIRMATORY IN VITRO EVALUATIONS OF HIV THERAPEUTICS

Part A shall provide for in vitro confirmatory testing of drug substances submitted to the DAIDS Preclinical Therapeutics Development Committee (DPTDC) for further development as potential anti-HIV therapies.  The goal of this contract resource is to independently confirm the initial observation of anti-HIV activity of promising drug substances and then examine the spectrum of in vitro activity in multiple cell types against panels of laboratory and/or primary HIV isolates representing different co-receptor usage, clade classification, and drug sensitivity.  In addition, potential drug-drug interactions shall be examined and drug-resistant HIV isolates shall be made for the most promising drug substances.  Part A will NOT support primary screening of new drug substances for anti-HIV activity.

Drug substances for evaluation under Part A are submitted to DAIDS by academic institutions, private biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies, and government sources.  Drug substances shall be provided to the Contractor in a blinded fashion and shall include small molecules, peptides, oligonucleotides, or polymeric substances.  Each drug substance shall have different evaluation needs that will be dependent on the nature of the drug substance, the proposed mode of action, and the needs of the provider of the drug substance.  Over 250 unique drug substances have been evaluated by the incumbent contractor employing a variety of assays, including: assays that use multiple isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2; acute and chronic infection assays; virus inactivation assays; p24, reverse transcriptase, and tetrazolium dye reduction as virologic endpoints; and tetrazolium dye reduction and tritiated thymidine incorporation as cytotoxicity endpoints.  Drug substances submitted to DAIDS for in vitro evaluation have originated 20% from academia, 40% from small biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies, and 40% from government sources.

PART B: SPECIALIZED IN VITRO VIROLOGICAL ASSAYS

Part B shall provide for biochemical, cell-based, and tissue-based assays to be performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of potential topical microbicides submitted to the DAIDS Topical Microbicide Working Group (DTMWG), and anti-HIV therapeutics submitted to the DPTDC.  Support shall also be provided for the development of new, and the improvement of existing, assays.  High throughput screening capabilities are necessary.  The drug substances to be submitted to the Contractor for analysis or assay development shall include small molecules, peptides, oligonucleotides, or polymeric substances.  Biological samples submitted for analysis shall not contain infectious agents, but could be derived from once infectious material inactivated via chemical or thermal means prior to submission.

In support of topical microbicide development, the assays to be performed include: (1) evaluation of potential topical microbicides for the ability to inhibit the transmission of HIV from infected to uninfected cells, or to inhibit the replication of HIV in relevant primary cells, established cell lines and tissue/organ cultures; (2) monitoring the effect of seminal plasma on the effectiveness of potential topical microbicides; (3) monitoring the toxicity of potential topical microbicides on hydrogen peroxide-secreting Lactobacillus; (4) mimicking the effect of pH transition that occurs during coitus on potential topical microbicides; and (5) determining the mechanism(s) of action of potential topical microbicides.

In support of anti-HIV therapeutic development, the assays to be performed shall include biochemical and cell-based assays to access the impact of potential inhibitors on the action of HIV proteins and relevant host cell factors.  Cytotoxicity and mechanism of action assays shall be also employed.

It is anticipated that two seven year cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, beginning approximately July 23, 2007.  

Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-07-25 will be available electronically on or about September 6, 2006 with a closing date tentatively set for December 6, 2006.   The RFP may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps web site located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ . 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.   This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with KAI Research, Inc. (PI: Dr. Selma Kunitz), contract # N01-NS-2-2343, awarded 04/01/02) in order to continue to provide support for management with monitoring clinical trials, tracking Institute-supported clinical projects, developing a classification system for research projects and providing methodological support.
Background: NINDS ranks as fourth among the NIH Institutes and Centers in the number of ongoing recruiting clinical trials.  The NINDS spent in FY 2004 $1.19 billion dollars on 3,423 research projects; of this amount over $372 million dollars (31%) was spent on 769 (22%) projects that required human subjects approvals from an IRG.  Of these grants, 47 were designated as phase III clinical trials, and 138 phase I and or II clinical trials, or planning grants for phase III clinical trials.  There are currently over 60 DSMB’s that are managed by NINDS program staff, as well as dozens of safety monitoring boards and independent safety monitors that are tracked by staff.  In addition to the clinical trials, NINDS also funds 1282 other clinical studies.  
The Clinical Trial Cluster at NINDS is charged with ensuring the highest quality of each NINDS-funded clinical research project and compliance with DHHS/NIH/NINDS regulations regarding human subject protections and safety monitoring.  To accomplish our mission, the NINDS plans to continue work that began several years ago under this contract to provide the Institute and its funded investigators support, oversight, collaboration, and guidance in the conduct of clinical studies.  In the past 5 years the activities and responsibilities for this contract have increased substantially.  These include the support of new projects, such as SPOTRIAS; the addition of NIH gender and minority data collection for human subject research projects for all NINDS DER; the data tracking system (with the addition of over 300 projects in the past year as well as a substantially increased demand on reporting), and performance of a growing number of site visits to clinical research projects (currently more than double the number initially proposed).  The contract renewal will build upon existing activities and architecture and provide support and guidance as future clinical study issues arise.

The current Center for Clinical Trial management Resources contract expires at the end of March 2007, and the NINDS intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with KAI Research, Inc. for an additional five years of funding.  Based on the experience of this contractor, we expect that the contract will continue to yield outstanding work for the Institute.  For the next 5-year contract period, the NINDS plans to continue to implement performance in the following task areas:

TASK #1:  MONITOR QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL IN CLINICAL TRIALS

Quality assurance in NINDS-funded clinical trials is the responsibility of the principal investigator and his/her staff.  However, the extent of investigators' experience and skill in developing and applying effective quality assurance procedures varies, and some investigators stand to benefit from assistance and guidance received from experts in quality assurance in clinical trials.  The overall objective of the quality assurance/quality control performance area is to ensure that the data resulting from a trial are of highest quality and are considered valid and credible within the scientific and clinical community. 

To assist the investigators in meeting this objective, the contractor shall use its scientific resources to review, monitor, and correct (if needed) quality assurance procedures in NINDS-funded clinical trials.  Specifically, the contractor shall:

1.	Develop guidelines for investigators and NINDS, specifying the procedures that the investigator should develop and implement to assure data quality and integrity;

2.	Provide technical assistance to investigators and NINDS to facilitate the interpretation and implementation of the data quality assurance guidelines;

3.	Develop in cooperation with NINDS program staff written procedures for use by the contractor for conducting site visits to review, assess, and correct (if needed) data quality assurance procedures (the initial site visit) and to monitor, assess, and correct (if needed) the implementation and effectiveness of data quality assurance procedures throughout the trial (periodic site visits and the final site visit);

4.	Conduct site visits according to the specifications of the procedures document developed in number 3 above.

TASK #2:  CLINICAL PROJECT TRACKING and MAINTENANCE AND UPDATE OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

In order to ensure the highest quality clinical research studies and compliance with DHHS/NIH/NINDS regulations regarding human subject’s protections and safety monitoring, accurate and up-to-date information on the status of all clinical research projects supported by NINDS is needed.  To facilitate the oversight process, the contractor shall be responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of a tracking system for all NINDS clinical research projects.  The purpose of this function is to identify and track clinical research projects through their various stages, from initial concept development through application, evaluation and award phases.  This readily accessible tracking system will provide rapid reporting of all clinical research projects supported by NINDS.  In accordance with NINDS scientific, programmatic and regulatory requirements, the contractor shall develop and continuously update a classification system for categorizing ongoing funded research projects in clinical and basic science related to the development of neurological therapies.  The Contractor has access to the NIH IMPACII (Information for Management Planning Analysis, and Coordination) Database, more specifically, the following modules: QVR (Query View Report) System to download grant applications; Population Tracking System to track gender and minority information; and the NINDS Scientific Research Project Database (SRPD) which connects to several National Institutes of Health enterprise-wide databases including IMPACII On-line Transaction Processing Database (OLTP) and the IMPACII Report Database (IRDB).  Through having access to the databases described above, the contractor shall be responsible for:

1.	Maintaining and updating the existing CLIPS database and the generation of reports.  This includes reviewing all new grants for inclusion into the database.

2.	Conducting a risk assessment of clinical research projects.

3.	Collecting and reporting to the NIH the gender and minority data for all identified projects; the NINDS collects supplemental information that is added to the CLIPS to get a more accurate account.

4.	Upon request, provide the customized NINDS CLIPS database that encodes NINDS clinical research project descriptors, the customized data dictionary with both administrative and scientific modules and all data that is used to generate NINDS periodic and ad hoc reports.  

TASK #3:  STATISTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL SUPPORT 

The contractor shall provide support and consultation to the NINDS in the area of statistics and clinical research methodology.  Specifically, assistance shall be required in the development of statistical and methodological guidelines for prospective applicants and for reviewers; statistical consultation will be needed in evaluating requests to submit applications for large clinical projects; expert advice will be needed to help solve methodological problems in ongoing clinical projects; and occasionally, statistical services will be required to conduct statistical analyses.  Additional activities may be needed for the support of special short-term projects to evaluate clinical research design, oversight, and conduct of clinical research.

TASK #4:  CLINICAL DATA ACQUISITION AND ARCHIVING  

The contractor shall provide consultation and services in the area of data acquisition and archiving.  After the termination of clinical research projects, investigators must decide which study materials will be retained or discarded.  For stored study materials, storage site, maintenance of confidentiality, and length of storage must be determined.  The contractor shall aid NINDS staff in developing information for investigators about archiving data after closure of a clinical trial. 

For some past contracts, data currently owned by NINDS requires archiving and analysis.  The contractor shall provide services necessary to acquire the data and to store them in an electronic form.  

TASK #5:  SPECIALIZED PROGRAM OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN ACUTE STROKE (SPOTRIAS)  

The contractor shall provide support of the SPOTRIAS data and the quality assurance/quality control of the SPOTRIAS sites.  Activities include the review of project and study descriptions, assist in data management and data management systems, data format, and quality control procedures; performance of site visits, assist in the development of common data elements, and provision of ongoing support and review.

TASK #6:  COMMON DATA ELEMENTS

The contractor shall provide support for the development of a core set of common data elements and forms supported by a data dictionary and data elements.  Literature searches will be conducted and reviewed, forms developed, consensus of key stakeholders sought, and once consensus is obtain these will be published and updated on the NINDS website.  Collaboration with other contractors, grantees or others within and outside the NINDS will be necessary.

The NINDS believes that KAI Research, Inc. is the only source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  NINDS requires immediate access to a contractor located close in proximity to be available to all NINDS Program Directors for conference calls, face-to-face meetings, etc. at a moments notice.  KAI has consistently demonstrated this ability and it’s in very close proximity to the NINDS locale.  KAI Research, Inc.’s familiarity with all ongoing NINDS clinical research portfolios and our infrastructure (specific NINDS/NIH databases) puts KAI, Research, Inc. in the most optimal position to continue to provide the Institute this work in a timely and cost-effective manner without causing substantial time delays or additional cost that would possibly be associated with an open competition to the government.  In order for another contractor to proceed at this point, it would cost the government significant additional dollars and major time delays during any sort of transition period.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302.  KAI Research, Inc. is considered the only source capable of performing the above services for the Government in order to maintain a constant level of consistency, uniformity and continuity of services provided.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for this requirement unfeasible.  See Numbered Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>10072006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Dr Julie Kimball with CIIT to develop and use anatomically accurate inspired air flow models of children and pre-adolescent human nasal tract regions, to evaluate the influence of age-related anatomy on inhalation dosimetry. The current NAICS code is 541710. Based on the EPA's knowledge of the Technical Support needed for the Statement of  Work (SOW) there may be unique capabilities to particular contractors/consultants. Background   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA-RTP) is currently developing methodologies and information sources for use in developing and advancing the  practice of inhalation dosimetry utilized to evaluate effects from inhaled agents. Overall, this project is being proposed as a means to advance the science that may be utilized in making estimates of safe exposures under inhalation exposure scenarios.  Specifically, this project would yield  information on intraspecies (human-to-human) variability among children and preadolescents that may be applied to this area of uncertainty common all health risk assessments performed by EPA.   The current EPA default procedures for dosimetry of gases to the upper airways tract utilizes a ratio of  the principal factors of ventilation volume and surface area of the affected area of the respiratory tract.  In this default form, these factors combine to give a theoretical estimate of dose to the affected area of the respiratory tract that would be the totality of the gas present in the air  breathed impinging on the totality of the affected area or VE / SART.  Further, the current EPA default assumes that impingement on the surface area occurs in a uniform manner such that every unit of the surface area is exposed to the same amount of air and gas present in that air.  General Task  Description Dr. Kimbell's more recent work has been to prepare highly individualized rather than representative maps of internal tract anatomy for several human subjects.  The individualized maps are of sufficient resolution to reflect intra-human differences in nasal tract anatomy.  CFD  simulations of these individualized models would be expected to predict and elucidate intra-human differences in flux to the underlying tissues.  Further, the pattern of flux may show differences based on the extent of the gas extraction of the individual gas from the inspired air.  Therefore this  project provides for generating the flux estimates using these individual models under different extents of gas extraction and to put forth proposals as to how the differences observed may be characterized.  As each spectra of flux will appear as a continuous spectrum, various means for providing a  more discrete description will be attempted which include, but is not limited to investigate the sorting of various intensities of flux into "bins". This "binning" or some similar process may be used to more quantitatively describe any predicted intra-human differences.   These predicted  intra-human differences would then be compared with and used to inform and characterize the current EPA default VE / SART for this area of the respiratory tract.        The deliverables from this specific project will be the second installment, the first having been completed under a previous EPA  Purchase Order.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact  within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a no-cost five (5) month term extension to contract 68D01055 with EC/R, Incorporated on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Since 2001, EC/R has provided support to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) in the development of national air pollution control emission standards.  During this time period, EC/R has supported, and continues to support, many projects that now are on court-ordered schedules, or being conducted in response to litigation on previously promulgated EPA actions, or are otherwise critical to the Agency’s mission.  Currently, Option Period IV of this contract expires on September 30, 2006.  New standards development contracts that will provide support for this work will not be awarded until approximately February 2007.  It is essential that progress be uninterrupted on these court-ordered and litigation-related projects that span several industry source categories to avoid the risk of the Agency being held in Contempt of Court as a result of missed court-ordered deadlines.  The proposed extension of this contract is to provide contractor support that will be limited to just the portion of the source categories listed in the contract Statement of Work that are on court-ordered schedules, litigation-related, or are otherwise critical to the Agency’s mission.  The types of activities supported will include development of area source and residual risk standards, as well as support for litigation.  Only EC/R, through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires.  A critically important fact is that the activities within these source categories are under court-ordered deadlines and involved in litigation, which requires the Agency to proceed with the work in progress without interruption.  Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform this effort within the time frames required by the Agency must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: US EPA, Attention: Julio E. Lopez, RTP Procurement Operations Division, Mail Drop E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency.  Capability statement should demonstrate the following:  1)  Demonstrated relevant experience in the development of air pollution regulations including the development of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards, Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and Alternative Control Technology (ACT) documents; 2) Demonstrated relevant experience with the following source categories: Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework, Carbon Black, Chloralkali Plants, Ferroalloy Production, Flexible Polyurethane Foam, Oil and Natural Gas Production, Paint Stripping, Polymers and Resins I, and Publicly Owned Treatment Works in order to conduct tasks to develop air pollution standards, and conducting related tasks such as emissions inventory and factor development, control technology evaluation, and industrial process engineering; experience in utilizing consensus building and meeting facilitation, particularly to develop environmental standards; 3)  Offerors must provide resumes for proposed key personnel (no more than ten) who have relevant experience and education in engineering and environmental sciences; and 4) Demonstrated successful past performance of the offeror in contracts and subcontracts for similar work.  Work which will be considered similar includes:  (1) air pollution regulation development; (2) emission estimations (both at the source and national levels), (3) control technology evaluation, (4) cost estimations (both for specific emission control devices and nationwide), (5) data gathering and analysis, (6) residual risk assessment and health effect estimation, (7) consensus building, meeting facilitation, negotiation techniques, and outreach activities, and (8) litigation support.  Offerors must provide a list of contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three (3) years and those currently in process.  If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the above mentioned five (5) month term extension on the mentioned contract with EC/R.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a no-cost five (5) month term extension to contract 68D03057 with Alpha-Gamma Technologies (Alpha-Gamma) on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Since 2001, Alpha-Gamma has provided support to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) in the development of national air pollution control emission standards.  During this time period, Alpha-Gamma has supported, and continues to support, many projects that now are on court-ordered schedules, or being conducted in response to litigation on previously promulgated EPA actions, or are otherwise critical to the Agency’s mission.  Currently, Option Period IV of this contract expires on September 30, 2006.  New standards development contracts that will provide support for this work will not be awarded until approximately February 2007.  It is essential that progress be uninterrupted on these court-ordered and litigation-related projects that span several industry source categories to avoid the risk of the Agency being held in Contempt of Court as a result of missed court-ordered deadlines.  The proposed extension of this contract is to provide contractor support that will be limited to just the portion of the source categories listed in the contract Statement of Work that are on court-ordered schedules, litigation-related, or are otherwise critical to the Agency’s mission.  The types of activities supported will include development of area source and residual risk standards, as well as support for litigation.  Only Alpha-Gamma, through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires.  A critically important fact is that the activities within these source categories are under court-ordered deadlines and involved in litigation, which requires the Agency to proceed with the work in progress without interruption.  Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform this effort within the time frames required by the Agency must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: US EPA, Attention: Julio E. Lopez, RTP Procurement Operations Division, Mail Drop E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency.  Capability statement should demonstrate the following:  1)  Demonstrated relevant experience in the development of air pollution regulations including the development of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards, Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and Alternative Control Technology (ACT) documents; 2) Demonstrated relevant experience with the following source categories: Combustion Turbines, National Air Toxics Deposition Monitoring Database, Stationary Engines, and Steel Minimills in order to conduct tasks to develop air pollution standards, and conducting related tasks such as emissions inventory and factor development, control technology evaluation, and industrial process engineering; experience in utilizing consensus building and meeting facilitation, particularly to develop environmental standards; 3)  Offerors must provide resumes for proposed key personnel (no more than ten) who have relevant experience and education in engineering and environmental sciences; and 4) Demonstrated successful past performance of the offeror in contracts and subcontracts for similar work.  Work which will be considered similar includes:  (1) air pollution regulation development; (2) emission estimations (both at the source and national levels), (3) control technology evaluation, (4) cost estimations (both for specific emission control devices and nationwide), (5) data gathering and analysis, (6) residual risk assessment and health effect estimation, (7) consensus building, meeting facilitation, negotiation techniques, and outreach activities, and (8) litigation support.  Offerors must provide a list of contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three (3) years and those currently in process.  If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the above mentioned five (5) month term extension on the mentioned contract with Alpha-Gamma.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-60158-NV
<RESPDATE>090606

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, for Templates for Reporting National Quality Forum Indicators of Cancer Care Using the National Cancer Data Base, with American College of Surgeons (ACoS), 633 North Saint Clair Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611-3211. The North American Industry Classification System code is 813920 and the business size standard is $6.5M. The National Quality Forum (NQF) develops and implements quality measures for a wide variety of medical conditions and health issues.  Under a program sponsored by federal partners including the NCI, CDC, AHRQ and CMS, the NQF is in the process of developing quality of care measures for breast and colorectal cancer.  The NQF solicited candidate measures from the oncology community and empanelled technical experts in these fields to evaluate and identify the most useful and practical measures, classifying them as measures suitable for provider-level quality improvement, population-based surveillance of the quality of care, or for provider accountability. These measures were presented to the project?s Steering Committee who recommended further development, testing, and piloting of the measures submitted by the American College of Surgeons. In April 2006, the NCI contracted with the ACoS to further refine and test these measures with registry data available through the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).  The goal of this project is to design and deploy reporting templates using web-based technologies that will provide CoC-Approved cancer programs with transparent, intuitive and easy to navigate reports that provide summary and detailed reports of concordance with the quality of care measures currently under consideration by the NQF.  These reports will also allow meaningful comparison across similar units of analysis - other non CoC-Approved cancer programs that share common characteristics such as geographical location, structural resources or services, or even systems affiliation.  Transparent reports with comparative elements are necessary to respond to the demands by health care consumers (patients and purchasers) for accountability measures - publicly reportable information that can be used to drive the selection of services and service providers.   The American College of Surgeons through their subsidiary the Commission on Cancer (CoC) developed the quality of care measures being used and submitted them to the NQF consensus process. Based on the intellectual property rights agreement with NQF, the American College of Surgeons hold ownership of these measure specifications during the measures testing process. Because the project requires the measures testing work be done on a nationally representative sample of hospital-based cancer programs, the ACoS Commission on Cancer?s National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is the only known source of cancer registry-based information containing such a sample. To the NCI?s knowledge no other data system exists to collect the ACoS registry-based cancer measures with the same degree of scope (approximately 1,400 CoC-approved cancer programs), comprehensiveness (all the measure data elements are already coded in the system), and quality (these data elements have already been validated in pilot projects sponsored by the College). The National Cancer Data Base is privately co-owned by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society and is unavailable for this work to other public or private organizations. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An Original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on September 6, 2006. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor?s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to verify all questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). NCI-60158-NV must be referenced on capability statements received in the contracting office.

Sole source determination is based on NIST?s need to design and build the PPLN device.  To build such a photon source, it needs to include the following items: Item A:  A CW diode laser module at 1064 nm (used as an oscillator); Item B:  Fast electronic pulse generator (for driving the existing laser amplitude modulator); Item C: Fiber laser amplifier (amplifier the laser power); Item D: Custom designed PPLN waveguide module that integrates a frequency doubling (SHG) device (converts wavelength from 1064nm to 532 nm) and a parametric frequency down conversion (OPG) device (generates photon pairs of 1310 and 895 nm from 532 nm).  Two identical PPLN waveguide modules are needed to form an entangled photon source.  HC Photonics Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the equipment which includes unique and proprietary design capabilities that are required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements as stated above. Delivery shall be FOB Destination and be completed in accordance with the Contactor?s commercial schedule. As defined in the federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), F.O.B. Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at delivery point specified in the purchase order, and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500 Employees. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 28, 2006. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The security of Veterans Affairs (VA) critical information systems and the privacy of sensitive data depend upon the proper implementation of a standardized and comprehensive security configuration and management program for the entire enterprise.  The NASA, SEWP, GWAC is the intended contract vehicle. No solicitation will be issued. The HIPS solution will adds a layer of defense at the application (host) level on every workstation and server with a HIPS agent installed.  With the information HIPS collects the VA is positioned to provide an adequate incident response capability to marginalize threats to workstations and servers.  The ISS Proventia HIPS software, already deployed in VA, integrates in to the VA ISS SiteProtector infrastructure.  This SiteProtector infrastructure provides aggregate points of threat data not only from the HIPS software but from Network-based Intrusion Pevention Systems (NIPS) hardware devices at the enterprise gateways into the VA network.   By leveraging the integration of these two security products, the VA-SOC is able to achieve a very high level of visibility into the administration’s enterprise security posture.  Together, both tools provide two disparate layers of protection. Only the Proventia Desktop, Proventia Server, and RealSecure Desktop Protector software products can integrate with the currently deployed VA NIPS devices and SiteProtector Server Infrastructure.  Venders that can offer an acceptable solution must submit their products functional capability to Jason.schoener@va.gov with copy to    gary.arwood@va.gov by 1pm, central, 8.28.06.  The Government will review your capability statement and respond by COB 8.28.06. No phone inquiries will be accepted all correspondence must be in writing, email is preferred.  Please provide ISS, 200-163-06 in the subject line for submission of functional capability statements.

Please feel free to use either site to access the information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This is an amendment to N00178-06-Q-2040. The following answers questions submitted regarding this synopsis: Q 1: We would like to know if there is a blueprint on this trailer?  If so does this trailer come with a Generator? If so what is the size. A 1: There is no blueprint for this trailer. No generator has been requested. Q 2: ATP Generator Box mounted on tongue.  Is a Generator required? If so, please advise KW, Fuel type, and Fuel Tank size. Is a Shore Power Cord or Reel required?  Is a Transfer Sw!  itch required? A 2: NO generator is required.  No shore power or reel is required. No transfer switch is required. Q 3: (4) Scissor Type stabilizer jacks rated at 500 pound capacity. We offer a telescoping galvanized steel stabilizer leg recessed inside the corner post with a capacity of 8,000 lbs. Will this be considered? A 3:  Note: the requirement should read 5000 pound capacity.  Yes. Q 4: 36 inch RV side Door with screen, flush lock, and foldout steps.  We offer a custom, severe duty door we manufacture with a slide out grip strut step. Will this be considered? A 4: Any door offered as a substitute shall be commercially available and be in the same form and function as the specified 36 inch RV side Door with screen, flush lock, and foldout steps. Deviations that do not conform may be rejected. Q 5: Twenty five foot aluminum I-Beam in Roof.  Please clarify that this is mounted to the inside of the ceiling.  Also, is the forty five hundred pound capacity twelve volt winc!  h system with remote and winch plate to be mounted to this I-beam with  a trolley assembly? A 5: The I-Beam shall be mounted inside the ceiling and have at least a 500 pound working load capacity and be designed such that a trolley and or chain hoist assembly of the same capacity can be mounted on said I-beam. No, the winch system is to be mounted at floor level in the nose section of the trailer. No trolley assembly is required. Q 6: Interior ceiling shall be 10 feet high.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMPETITIVE SYNOPSIS WITH A SEPARATELY ISSUED SOLICITATION

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Review of NCI Thesaurus for OBO-Compliance and Training to Help NCI Achieve Compliance.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541512 and the business size standard is $23M.  

Introduction: The two major terminology products of the Electronic Vocabulary System (EVS) are the NCI Metathesaurus http://ncimeta.nic.nih.gov/ and the NCI Thesaurus http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/.  The tasks in the SOW are focused on the NCI Thesaurus.

NCI Thesaurus is a description logic concept based namespace that contains cancer-centric terminology.  It is primarily intended for use by applications to traverse vocabulary trees and the semantic relationships between and among concepts.  It provides the base semantics for NCI?s metadata infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR) and NCI?s data repository infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caBIO). In addition it is used by NCI to index the NCI?s Web portal site (see http://cancer.gov); by NIH to construct concept vectors used by the NIH knowledge management system; by the cancer Bioinformatics Grid (see http://caBIG.nci.nih.gov) to provide terminology for the various activities; and by numerous scientific applications, across a growing number of domains that increasingly extend beyond cancer.  NCI Thesaurus is published monthly by the NCI under an open content license (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/ThesaurusTermsofUse.pdf). 

Scope:  Four (4) general activities are within scope of this SOW.  The first activity is a review and report of OBO criteria and relevant ISO standards for semantic quality and federation of terminologies as well as identifying and defining a set of goal requirements for semantic quality and consistency.  The second is review of the content and semantic structure of a small specified subset of NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical terminology produced by the NCI, for compliance with relevant International Standards Organization (ISO) standards; and for compliance with standards related to qualification as an open terminology under OBO; and for compliance with design and semantics criteria for federation with other OBO terminologies. The third activity includes documenting several clear examples of the modeling that would be needed to achieve compliance; this activity could draw on the work conducted in the second activity.  And the fourth activity includes training several NCI designated Editors or Quality Assurance staff to finish reviewing and editing the NCI Thesaurus for compliance.

Period of Performance:  Anticipated, thirty eight (38) weeks after initial award.  Only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  Interested parties that wish to receive a copy of the solicitation must do so by the following:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   Request shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone and fax numbers, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ number RFQ-NCI-60100-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is August 2, 2006 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is August 3, 2006 and the estimated due date is August18, 2006. Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  No collect calls will be accepted.

Responding firms should demonstrate experience during the past ten (10) years.  The board will evaluate the specialized experience on projects and the technical capabilities of the prime firm and any subco ntractors.  The effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure, coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will also be examined.  State whether the experience is that of the pri me (or joint venture), consultant or an individual.  Work cited that is experience of prime (or joint venture) from an office other than that identified shall be so labeled.  Specialized experience to be evaluated for this project is as follows (all specia lized experience factors are listed in descending order of importance):  (1) Experience with the operation of groundwater, and/or leachate treatment facilities including operating, maintaining, monitoring, repairing, and incidental construction support.  P rovide the size, duration, and yearly operation and maintenance cost of the treatment facility.  (2) Provide experience with optimizing equipment performance, monitoring requirements and overall system protectiveness (containment of site plume, etc.).

The board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience working together of key management and technical perso nnel.  This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel.  Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications in these primary personnel, which are listed in descending order  of importance.

The board will also consider the prime firm and its consultants in the offices proposed to perform the w ork in relationship to the firms current workloads.  Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities.  The overall most highly qualified firms will no t be rejected solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts.  Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months.  Please indicate all Tas k Orders and Modifications awarded your firm by DoD agencies within the last twelve (12) months under an indefinite delivery type contract.  Indicate date of Task Orders and fee for each.  (E) Costs may be compared to historical data or current averages fo r the area.

The pro posed costs will constitute advance agreements for the contract for the awardee(s).  (F)  Subcontracting Plan.  All Offerors who are unrestricted businesses are required to complete and return the plan, signed by the appropriate official, as part of their proposal.  The Offeror shall include three projects that would be reflective of the diligence in meeting Small and Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business subcontracting goals.     (4).

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis General Information Document Type: 	Sources Sought Notice Classification Code:	A70 Electronic Computer Manufacturing Set Aside:	To be Determined NAICS Code:	334112-Computer Storage Device Manufacturing Contracting Office Address: US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC), Acquisition Center, Southwest Sector, ATTN: AMSEL-AC- S, Building 61801, Room 3212, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613-6000 Notice to Offeror's: This Sources Sought Synopsis is being issued to assist the C-E LCMC in performing market research, to determine industry interest and capability and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Description: The U.S. Army Information Systems Command (USAISEC) anticipates issuing a requirement for the replacement of their Storage Area Network (SAN) solution that will provide an increase in useable storage capacity and scalability, an increase in flexibility of data allocation (i.e. file share use vs. database use, and fiber channel drives vs. SATA drives), an increase in the flexibility of connectivity (fiber channel connectivity vs. iSCSI connectivity), and an increase in data integrity and recoverability to in clude full redundancy in all aspects.  This solution will also provide for the replacement of Windows file servers with Network Attached Storage (NAS).   This solution must be easily managed and will include training for USAISEC Systems Administrators. USAISEC currently has a StorageTek 9176 controller-based fiber channel SAN on Fort. Huachuca Arizona.  The manufacturer will stop supporting this system on September 30, 2006.  As a result, USAISEC has a need to replace the current system. USAISECs current system consists of approximately 23 Terabytes (TB) of useable space as follows: 1) There is a fully redundant 1, Gigabit (Gb) fiber channel fabric consisting of fourteen 8-port StorageTek (Brocade Silkworm) 4108 and two 16-port 4116 switches, connecting four buildings. 2)  There are four controller nodes, of which there are two nodes co-located in building A, and 1 node each in buildings B and C.  The nodes in building A (10TB) provide approximately a 60/40 mix of space for file shares through Windows 2000/2003 file serv ers and database space for Microsoft Exchange 5.5 and Microsoft SQL.  The node in building B (5TB) provides approximately an 85/15 mix of file server space and SQL space. The 8TB of space on the node in building C is set aside exclusively for Disaster Reco very (DR) and Continuity Of Operations (COOP).  All space at all locations is currently on 169GB fiber channel drives. 3)  All data backup and DR is currently performed via Veritas NetBackup software to disk in building C.  4)  A replacement solution shall initially require at least 30TB of useable space of which Building A shall initially require at least 15TB of useable storage with 10TB of space available through Network Attached Storage (NAS) and 5TB available through the  fiber channel fabric (associated with SAN).  This space will be fiber channel disk with the flexibility to add Serial Advanced Technology Architecture (SATA) disk at a later date.  Building C (DR site) will initially require at least 15TB of useable stora ge with 10TB available to back up the NAS accessible space and 5TB available to back up the SAN accessible space.  This space will be SATA disk with the flexibility to add fiber channel disk at a later date. Scalability and data allocation flexibility of the useable space:  The above usable space must scale to at least 300% with a minimum of hardware and software change out, minimum data migration, and minimum cost.  The need may also arise for the reallocatio n of space, e.g., SAN accessible space vs. NAS accessible space.  Data protection and availability is to be considered at all levels of this replacement solution and may include mirroring or replication to another controller node. A replacement solution shall be simple to operate and shall include a Graphical User Interface (GUI) as well as a Command Line Interface (CLI).  It is preferable that the GUI not be Java based. An installed client would be ideal.  The GUI should include the ability to grow and s hrink LUNs/volumes on the fly.  Full documentation will be required for both interfaces.  The solicitation will require that you describe in detail your management interfaces and whether the GUI has limitations compared to the CLI or CLI compared to the GU I. A replacement solution must include a three-year warranty with all part deliveries scheduled for next business day, and 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year full-tier telephonic technical support.   Vendor comments regarding this acquisition are encouraged.  C-E LCMC requests the following information from interested offerors.  For marketing research purposes provide the following information: 1)	State your full company name, address, and employees/revenues.  2)	State whether you are listed as a small business under the NAICS 334111. 3)	State your  Cage Code/DUNS.  4)	If you do not manufacture the end product for this requirement, State the name of the company that manufactures the product along with their business size, NAICS, and cage code.  This information will determine how the nonmanufacturing rule prescribed i n 13 CFR 121.406(b) applies to a small business.  5)	Is your company able to provide the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis?  If so, explain how your company can meet any part or all of the above mentioned criteria.  Limit statement to five (5) pages.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Zynetix Portable GSM Network Systems
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

The Government intends to purchase two systems based on the following:

1.  AFCA/TCPI proposes to purchase a Zynetix Portable Global System for Mobile (GSM) Network System.  This system is composed of two Zynetix Field Deployable Controllers (part #BTSG-1), two packet Data Aggregation Modules (part #PDA-SW), and one Gateway Controller (part #GWYUPG) from Lociva, 15330 Riding Club Dr., Haymarket, VA 20169.  Contractor will provide all required equipment for the base station configuration and licenses.  Estimated dollar value is $103,430.00.

2.  Lociva is the only known source that is authorized to distribute Zynetix products in the United States.  Zynetix retains all title, copyright, and other proprietary rights to their equipment and software systems.  Lociva is the only company legally qualified to fulfill all requirements and that can provide any required support.

3.  Due to the fact that Lociva is Zynetix's only know authorized distributor, the only option available that would allow competition would be to try to obtain new equipment from a different vendor.  Two previous orders, totaling $160,000.00 have been made for similar Zynetix equipment.  The cost to place new equipment alongside previously purchased Zynetix equipment, test the equipment for functionality, and to train personnel on the new equipment, would be prohibitive.  There would be a significant loss of operational efficiency while learning how to use the new equipment.

This Notice is SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FY 2007 FUNDS pursuant to FAR Clause 52.232-18.  This notice does not obligate funds.  The Government intends to purchase MAINTENANCE services for the following software licenses that were previously purchased under a competitive award:

In 2002 a competitive procurement was awarded for the Sharpe Warehouse Consolidation project to Tompkins Associates.  HighJump Software was recommended by Tompkins and accepted by GSA.  It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.  
The General Services Administration Federal Supply Service (FSS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) purchased HighJump for 9 Windows 2000 server systems, which are housed at the Sharpe Depot in French Camp, CA.  These systems support the Warehouse Management System (WMS) application at Sharpe and are central to GSA’s mission.
The WMS system is used to manage storage and process inbound and outbound of material and is based on HighJump software products.  Annual maintenance is necessary to continue operations.

HighJump Software and the maintenance subscription are proprietary, and no other vendor is authorized to manufacture or resell the product.  The vendor is qualified on the basis that the software has been deployed as a standard at the GSA Sharpe Depot.

All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau has a requirement for expert advice and assistance in planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects in support of the mission of the Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau is the premier source of information about the American people and the economy. More than just numbers, this information shapes important policy decisions that help improve the nation’s social and economic conditions.

The Census Bureau’s mission is built around large-scale surveys and censuses. Activities involve survey and questionnaire design, geographic infrastructure update, and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis help improve processes from data collection through dissemination.  Within the Census Bureau is the Information Technology Directorate, the mission of which is to provide the Census Bureau and other customers with a world-class Information Technology Program. In addition, the Information Technology Directorate is undergoing institutional change as it continues to migrate from proprietary to open and distributed processing systems.  

The Information Technology Directorate has the primary responsibility for planning, implementing, and operating information technology (IT) programs and facility projects, and requires high level IT strategic and operational expertise beyond its inherent resources in order to effectively support the mission of the Census Bureau.  These services include the following:  (a) recommending and facilitating implementation of new initiatives to assist the Associate Director for Information Technology in the centralization of IT functions; reviewing and evaluating administrative and technical IT operations, (c) designing and preparing materials and presentations for the Associate Director, executives, client briefings and various forums; (d) providing on-going expert consultation and advisement concerning the mission, direction and operations of the Information Technology Directorate, (e) providing independent reviews and evaluation services on administrative and operational issues, and (f) making recommendations for such areas as streamlining efforts, problem solutions, business practice reengineering, integration and improvements.  The effectiveness of these services is highly dependent on the ability to project a thorough understanding and intimate knowledge of the Census Bureau mission, programs goals, existing and emerging, policies, current and changing priorities, strategic plans, and current and developing operations as well as the ability to develop and maintain effective relationships with executives and managers throughout the Census Bureau community in order to garner acceptance of viewpoints, influence decision-making, and garner support and cooperation for implementing recommendations and carrying out projects.  

It is critically important to maintain estimated schedules and endure continuity of ongoing initiatives, projects and other efforts, many of which are time-critical, in order to avert interruptions, delays, duplicative work, relearning, and excessive costs.  For the past five years, The Associate Director for Information Technology has obtained these services from Mr. Charles Hancock of Bowie, MD.  Mr. Hancock has demonstrated the ability to satisfy the Government’s requirements as described above.  Based on the nature of the work and available information, Mr. Hancock is considered the only source that can meet the Government’s requirement satisfactorily.  It is the Government’s intention to solicit and negotiate a contract for the requirement with Mr. Hancock on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302.  The intended contract will have a period of performance of one year and will include four one-year option periods.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 14 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not  to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NIGMS Science Writing, Electronic Content Development and Planning,
and Outreach Strategy

August 2006


Purpose

The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) requires an on-site contractor for science writing, electronic content development and planning, and outreach strategizing. The contractor will function as the Institute?s expert advisor on electronic opportunities and trends, and will conduct outreach activities related to the NIGMS Web site and other communication products and events.  These products include the NIGMS Feedback Loop electronic newsletter to grantees and approaches to promote two-way interaction with the scientific community.

Background

NIGMS is one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the principal biomedical research agency of the Federal Government.  NIGMS supports basic biomedical research that lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.  With a budget of nearly $2 billion, the Institute funds more than 4,000 research grants at universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions across the country. Unlike most other NIH components, NIGMS does not conduct research in its own laboratories on the NIH campus.

The NIGMS Web site (http://www.nigms.nih.gov) plays a critical role in supporting the Institute?s mission.  The site currently receives more than 60,000 visits a month from a wide variety of users.  University-level scientists and academics, including grant applicants and recipients, are a major audience.  The site is also frequently visited by teachers and students; policymakers and their staff; NIGMS and NIH staff; staff of other government agencies and the individuals they serve; staff and members of professional societies, foundations, and organizations; print and broadcast journalists; library professionals; and the general public.

The NIGMS Web site is hosted by the NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) on two servers.  The first, a Microsoft Content Management Server (CMS), contains the bulk of the Institute?s Web content, which is presented dynamically from a database via a collection of templates developed by CIT.  The rest of the Institute?s Web content, consisting primarily of online publications and forms, is hosted on an Active Server Page (ASP) server.  Most of the pages on this server are coded as static HTML files (with an ?.htm? file extension).  Other types of documents on this server include a number of Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files and a few ASP scripts (mainly for user feedback forms and a publication ordering form).

The templates on the Microsoft CMS use a horizontal banner graphic at the top of each page with links to a Google search box, the NIGMS and NIH home pages, a Site Map, and a Staff Contacts page, as well as tabs for accessing major sections of the site.  Pages throughout the site also include ?breadcrumb? links that serve the two-fold purpose of indicating where pages are located within the site as well as allowing visitors to easily find contextually relevant content. 

Web Coding and Design Standards

The contractor shall work with NIH/CIT Web developers and other NIGMS staff and contractors to maintain and extend the functionality of the NIGMS Web site in support of the Institute?s communications and outreach goals.

The contractor should feel free to suggest other Web technologies, when appropriate, that enhance the capabilities of the NIGMS site.  These include Macromedia Flash files, JavaScript scripts, and cascading style sheets (CSS).  However, wherever these technologies are used, standard HTML equivalents should also be available as ?defaults? if a particular user?s Web browser does not support these technologies.  For example, a Flash-enabled banner should have a standard GIF-image equivalent, and if there is a JavaScript-enabled image rollover (say, that provides a description of a graphic), there should be an ALT-attribute equivalent for that image.

Other design considerations include the following:

?	Accessibility and usability?All work by the contractor should adhere both to best practices in Web site usability engineering and to Federal standards (Section 508) regarding Web site accessibility for users of assistive technologies, as mentioned in the Web site design guidelines below.
?	Screen size?The layout for all Web pages should be optimized for a screen size of 800 by 600 pixels, in order to make the best use of the space available in a typical Web browser window on today?s computer monitors.  However, pages should ideally be flexible enough to expand or contract according to how a user resizes a browser window.
?	File size?The total file size for each Web page?including graphics, linked files (e.g., cascading style sheets, JavaScript source files, etc.)?should be no more than approximately 50 kilobytes.  This limit is to ensure that visitors connecting to the NIGMS Web site over slow dial-up connections can still access the site without unreasonable delays.
?	Fonts?Web pages should be designed using standard fonts and font sizes, as would typically be found on most Windows and Macintosh systems.
?	Colors?There is no required color scheme for either graphics or fonts used in Web pages.  However, the contractor should take into consideration issues of colorblindness and other forms of visual impairment when selecting colors.  For example, there should be adequate contrast between foreground and background colors so that icons can be clearly distinguished and text can be easily read.  Color should not be used as the sole means to convey information.
?	Cascading Style Sheets?Recommended CSS files should be used to control the attributes of text and layout elements as much as possible, in order to provide consistency across the Web site.
?	Cross-browser, cross-platform compatibility?Web pages should look as identical as possible on commonly used Web browsers, on Windows and Macintosh systems alike.  If needed, separate CSS files optimized for certain browsers should be provided.  For older browsers, the templates should still be functional and pose no impediment to accessing the navigational aids or contents of the page.

Contractor Requirements

NIGMS requires on-site contractor support for science writing, electronic content development and planning, and strategic outreach for its Web site and other electronic communication activities and products.  Specifically, the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to:

Science Writing

?	Writing and editing a variety of documents such as the NIGMS Feedback Loop electronic newsletter.
?	Editing content for the NIGMS Web site for grammar, formatting, and scientific accuracy.

Electronic Content Development and Planning
?	Determine the need for new or updated material and solicit, write, edit, clear, and post such material as appropriate.
?	Interact with technical, scientific, communications, and managerial staff and contractors at NIGMS and NIH, particularly CIT, to facilitate the involvement, input, and enthusiasm of all parties who are or will be involved in content development.  These interactions may be in person, by telephone, or via e-mail.
?	Work with NIGMS staff to consider and, when appropriate, implement their ideas regarding additions to and augmentation of Web site content and tools.
?	Organize and present the content in effective and aesthetically pleasing ways.
?	Identify appropriate uses of images, animations, and other multimedia technology on the site.  Solicit, develop, or contract for such products.  Obtain permissions to use and post this material.
?	Work with other contractors and OCPL staff to ensure that content is up-to-date and accurate and that all links on the NIGMS Web site are appropriate and functional.
?	Work with designers, graphic artists, and technical personnel from NIGMS, CIT, and other organizations (including contractors) as necessary to redesign, develop, enhance, and maintain the Web site.
?	Participate in meetings at OCPL, NIGMS, NIH, DHHS, and other parts of the Federal Government and biomedical/communications/Web communities.  Attend meetings such as the NIH Web Authors Group (WAG), CMS Users Group, American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey meetings, and meetings with CIT as the NIGMS or OCPL representative and report back to NIGMS staff as appropriate.  Serve on OCPL, NIGMS, NIH, or other committees as assigned.  Attend OCPL staff and other meetings.
?	Keep abreast of Web technical developments to ensure that the best, most current technologies and practices are implemented, as appropriate, on the NIGMS Web site.
?	Evaluate and recommend relevant Web design, development, and management software, hardware, and contract services; advise on justifications/purchase requests necessary to acquire and license the selected and approved items; and implement the transition to such software, hardware, and contract services.
?	Strategize new and improved features and coverage areas for the NIGMS Web site and determine how best to present these materials.
?	Recommend improvements to existing Web material.
?	Work with NIGMS staff to help them meet their Web-related communication needs.
?	Establish Web-related policies and guidelines and communicate them to NIGMS staff.
?	Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the Web site and Internet-based outreach efforts, incorporating data from sources such as Web usability tests, WebTrends reports, and ACSI surveys and making changes to the site in response to the data gathered.
?	Assess trends in the Internet as they relate to biomedical research news and build on them to launch new coverage areas and site features.

     wells and cell migration devices, with all materials biocompatible, 
     tissue culture treated and supplied sterile.
5.  The analyzer shall be capable of measuring the impedance of the 
     circuit when a mild alternating current is passed through the electrode 
     array.
6.  The analyzer shall incorporate a gold circle-on-line microelectrode 
     array.
7.  The analyzer shall be capable of being upgraded to a 6 x 96 well plate
     system
8.  The analyzer shall include two (2) one year parts and service contracts
     at no additional cost to the government.
9.  The analyzer shall include installation and training for three NIH staff 
     members at no additional cost to the government.
10.The analyzer shall include software upgrades at no additional cost to 
     the government.

This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit  and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

However, all quotes received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government .  A determination by the Government  not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received  will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. 5114-6-0018 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 333314. For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees. The USDA/ARS National Center for Agriculture Utilization Research, Peoria, Illinois, requests proposals for the purchase of two (2) Microscope Systems.  These Microscopes will be used to label and simultaneously image several fluorescent proteins in an accurate and efficient manner. Documenting these proteins requires a high level of spatial and spectral resolution. Due to temporal considerations, the process also needs to go quickly and with a minimum of extraneous manipulation of the system particularly in our multiple-user environment. Ergonomics and ease of use factors are important to the end user. The Microscope systems shall be interoperable and interchangeable, both software and hardware, with existing Zeiss Systems in a networked environment. THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS-CLIN #1 Research Fluorescence Microscope System- The microscope system must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 1) The microscope must have an Apochromatically corrected reflected light illumination train. 2) The microscope fluorescence filter turret must employ light trap technology that virtually eliminates stray light in the fluorescence illumination system.  The turret must be encoded so that its individual filter module positions can be read by the system?s camera software. 3) The microscope fluorescence filter modules must be of tool-free, push-and-click design and be accessible from the front of the filter turret. 4) The microscope trinocular head must be non-tilting, with a vertical adjustment range of 50mm and a binocular angle of 20 degrees.  It must provide a reversed image to the eyepieces and must direct light 100% to the eyepieces or 100% to the phototube, with no intermediate position. 5) The microscope eyepieces must have a field number of 23.  They must have separate zero-diopter adjustment indicators for use with and without reticles. 6) The microscope body must be configured with light management technology allowing each user to program his or her individual illumination preferences. 7) The microscope stage must be ceramic-coated and have ball bearing rotation through 240 degrees.  Its control arm must be user-adjustable for height and tension and its specimen holder must be optimized for use with immersion objectives. 8) The microscope diascopic illumination train must be outfitted with neutral-density filters of 0.50%, 0.25% and 0.12% transmission in dual rotating wheels. 9) The microscope objective nosepiece must be encoded so that its individual objective positions can be read by the system?s camera software.  It must accept objectives of 27mm thread diameter. 10) The microscope condenser must be achromatic/aplanatic, with numerical aperture 0.9.  It must contain DIC prisms with integral polarizers. 11) The microscope must be configured with a second photo port mounted to the left side of the microscope body. 12) The microscope system must include two cameras with the following characteristics: a) Camera #1: 13-Megapixel color mosaic, Peltier-cooled, with PCI/fiber optic interface between camera and computer--controllable by Zeiss AxioVision software with native file format .zvi (This software is currently in use in our lab.) b) Camera #2: 1.4-Megapixel Monochrome, Peltier-cooled, with FireWire interface between camera and computer--controllable by Zeiss AxioVision software with native file format .zvi (This software is currently in use in our lab.) 13) The microscope system must include software for control of Zeiss cameras.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

d. Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and? 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

e. Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids).   
The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) within USAID is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in responding to international crises and disasters.  It is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and two sub-regional offices.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica, Bangkok, Thailand, Dakar, Senegal, Nairobi, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa.  The sub-regional offices are in Kathmandu, Nepal and in Bridgetown, Barbados.    

The regional office in Bangkok, and its sub-regional office in Kathmandu, cover the Asia-Pacific region, which includes 26 countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia, 16 Pacific Island nations, Australia, and New Zealand.  The region is comprised of rich and poor nations, and politically stable and failing states.  It is a region of diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.  The sub-regional office in Nepal primarily serves the countries in South Asia, i.e. Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan.  However, it also supports OFDA's efforts elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region when necessary.  The operation of this sub-regional office is managed by two Regional Advisors.  

Introduction

OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).


OBJECTIVE

DCHA/OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor in its sub-regional office in Kathmandu, Nepal, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded activities, and identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region are effectively met.   

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of Nepal on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The contractor will actively oversee disaster response activities, and develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. Focusing primarily on South Asia, the Regional Advisor will be responsible for the following:

Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Regional Advisor in Bangkok, the contractor will:

* Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with Washington and/or the Senior Regional Advisor; 
* Coordinate and maintain close liaison with senior representatives of host government, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
* Monitor DCHA/OFDA funded activities; 
* Approve OFDA relief supply requests in consultation with OFDA Washington and coordinate receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of supplies;
* Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of  DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs for short periods of time;
* Maintain regular communications with the Asia-Pacific Regional Office in Bangkok;
* Prepare field information and reports, as required by OFDA/Washington. 
Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the contractor will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the contractor will:

* Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
* Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;
* Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA efforts including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
* Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the Asia-Pacific Regional Office.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
* Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
* Work with senior representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:  The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Senior Regional Advisor for the Asia-Pacific Region.  However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the Asia Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:  Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6048. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 dated 8/4/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 6(six) bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 2(two) lots of the RML custom chip #2 from the manufacturer. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  The contractor shall provide to RML services  to produce 2(two) lots of chips, totaling approximately 90(ninety) chips.  This is a 40(forty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) lots of RML custom gene chips, at 45(forty-five) chips per lot.  SCHEDULE:  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip? was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip? probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip? probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip? probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray? Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and database.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors:

1.  Q. Will the selected WM system vendor(s) be permitted to attend and participate in the actual fire testing of the COTS system? 
     A.  They will be encouraged to attend.

2.  Q.  Will the vendor be involved in the installation and positioning of the nozzles in the test mock-up and pre-testing of the WM system? 
    A.   It is important that the vendor be involved in all aspects of the installation and testing.

3.  Q.  Does the proposal pricing cover only the price of nozzle hardware and installation data or should it also include for the supply of high pressure pump/motor units and motor controller?  
    A.  SHADWELL currently has several high pressure pumps and systems.  It is the Navy’s intention to make this available to the vendor if it meets their requirements.  If the vendor feels the Navy equipment will bias their test, then the vendor should propose their pump and distribution system with a rationale as to why the Navy system will not meet their requirements.  

4.   Q.  Will the Piping take the pressure of 100 bar?
     A.   The piping will take the pressure (100 bar), but the flanges will not.  In order for the offeror to use the current system with their pump, they would have to change out the flanges.

s the seller is asserting in their warranty such as ?if it breaks I?ll fix it for free?. 
 
16.Question: How much detail should be included?  Should we give a general outline of the items we would check in a site audit, vendor qualification audit, etc.?  Or is it acceptable to say that we have SOPs which would be supplied to the FDA when the contract was awarded? 
Response:This Scope of work is NOT requesting actual audits to be preformed.
  
17.Question:In addition to our employees, Polaris uses about 20 independent contractors to perform our audits.  Most of these contractors are   incorporated.  Does FAR clause 52.203-6 (Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I) mean that only a particular company auditors can perform the work on this project?  Or does FAR clause 52.219-14 (Limitations on Subcontracting) mean that at least 50% of the work will need to be performed by employees?
 
Response:This requirement has been 100% set-aside for a woman own company which means, the awardee must perform 51% of the work, and this is in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-14 ? Limitation on Subcontracting.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0004 is to:1. replace Amendment 0003 in its entirety, 2.Change the Contracting Officer to Patricia Pemberton, and 3. Respond to question submitted in response to this RFQ.  

Questions and Responses

 1.Question:Does CFSAN have written quality assurance procedures? 
Response: Yes
 
2.Questionn: We assume that studies will be the unit of review in addition to the  overall quality assurance process? Is this correct?
Response: Yes
 
3.Question: How many studies, in addition to the overall quality assurance process, will be reviewed annually?
Response: The Scope of Work is not requesting actual audits -- only review and  recommendations for CFSAN's current CGP QA Program. The studies  that will be ultimately reviewed by FDA Office of Science designees  would be about 20.
 
4.Question:Where are the contractors and study sites located? How many trips  should be budgeted for annually?
Response:The scope of Work is NOT requesting actual audits to be performed.
 
5.Question:What are the evaluation criteria for the RFQ? 
Response: The evaluation criterion is located under ?Personnel Requirements?.

6.Question:Do the 25 pages include only the technical approach or also resumes and budget?
Response:The total amount of pages is hereby increased to 50.
 
7.Question: What is the period of performance since August 14, 2006 will have  already passed by time of award?
Response:The Period of Performance is hereby changed to September 18, 2006 through September 17, 2007.

8.Question: How will ongoing review of studies take place if the period of performance is only one year?
Response:The Agency and CFSAN will be responsible for the audits -- the scope of Work is requesting the review and recommendations of the  current CFSAN GCP QA Program SOPs.
 
9.Question: Will we be responsible for implementing the corrective action plan?
Response: No.

10.Question: Our company would like to supply the resumes or biographies for the people who would be on the project, but we don't know the size or scope of the work. Consequently, don't know how many people are needed.  How many studies are being conducted?  How many audits willbe needed? 
Response: No audits are being requested in the scope of work.  What has been described in the scope of work is "Review "of CFSAN's current SOPs for its GCP Quality Assurance Program and for the contractor then to make recommendations for any changes to improve the current QA program.
 
12.Question: Assumedly, investigative sites and vendor qualification audits are needed.  Are other audits needed too -- such as IRB audits, QA of regulatory documents (protocols, Investigator Brochures, Final Study Reports, etc.)? 
Response:No audits are being requested in the scope of work.   The contractor will review the current CFSAN GCP Quality Assurance Program and make recommendations for any changes to improve the current QA program.  The references to "vendor" or outside contractors conducting studies for the Center were made to be included in the "review" and "recommendations" of the current SOPs for the CFSAN GCP QA program.
 
13.Question: It sounds like there is a need for monitoring in addition to auditing (i.e., verifying that the data in the Case Report Forms or other data collection instruments are supported by source documentation).  Is this true?  If so, how much monitoring is needed compared to auditing?   
 
Response: The reference to monitoring of studies was again for the contractor to review current SOPs for this process and to make recommendations to CFSAN HSP Lead to improve the program NOT to actually conduct an audit. 
 
14.Question: Will the study sites (and therefore, the audit sites) be located allaround the country?  Or will they all be in the DC/Rockville area? Are there any international sites? 
Response:No audits are being requested in the Scope of Work. 
 
15.Question: What is meant by "terms of any express warranty"?  
Response: Term
