<a href="mailto:mike.dalessandro@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick R&D (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division in support of  the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, has a requirement to acquire integrated short-range, low-bandwidth, wearable communications, sensing, and networking technologies that will enable the analysis, display, and remote monitoring of summary activity, physiologic, and geo-location data from free-roaming dismounted Warfighters in a variety of austere military training settings.  These technologies will be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of training, decrease the likelihood of environmentally-induced injuries, and speed evacuation in the event of illness or injury.  The envisioned network topology is three-tiered and includes an on-body bi-directional wireless Personal Area Network (PAN) integrated with a Squad Area Network (SAN) that links individual trainees with their instructor/squad leader.  The third tier is formed by a repeater backbone capable of relaying data from a SAN to a central Tactical Operations Center (TOC).  Bandwidth and message rate requirements are intentionally modest with a desired status update rate under optimal conditions of once per minute per connected Warfighter.  No video data or real-time voice will be carried by this network.  The overall design must to adhere to a minimalist philosophy of simplicity, robustness, technological transparency to the Government, openness to new third-party sensors and algorithms, and ease of maintenance.  Networking technologies desired generally fall into the category of mobile, ad-hoc, delay/disruption-tolerant mesh networks.  A fully operational prototype network compromising a minimum of 5 Trainee Nodes, 1 Instructor Node, 1 Repeater Node, and 1 Tactical Operations Center Node that includes user interface and network management software, is desired at the end of the first year.  The work effort for year two (Option Year 1), and year three (Option Year 2) will focus on scaling the system to Platoon and Company level applications, respectively.   Each node must be capable of hosting Government-furnished health state classification algorithms and of storing both physiologic and network performance data for later analysis.  The system and its underlying technologies must ultimately be scalable for simultaneous use by Battalion-sized groups.  The communications technologies underlying the SAN and repeater backbone must operate in the 225  380 MHz military band and be capable of generating and receiving signals with 12.5 KHz to 25 KHz occupied bandwidth channels.  Because of the potential need for band and frequency agility, and to facilitate future system upgrades, software defined radios are required.  Because of their greatly reduced or absent radio-frequency emissions, short-range, inductive-based wireless technologies are required for the PAN.  The overall integrated system must be capable of operating in a completely self-contained mode, not relying on any fixed infrastructure.  Repeater nodes must be capable of being deployed and retrieved by two person teams.  No major subsystem may rely on any proprietary third-party technology.  The system must be designed to be set up and operated solely by resident Training Cadre as part of their normal training exercises.  The overall design of the system and its sub-components must facilitate future adaptations to changing military operational and research needs and accommodate small-volume applications, while still adhering to the overall minimalist concept of the system as a whole.  This procurement will be 100% Small Business Set-Aside and all offerors must meet the definition of Small Business Concern as defined in FAR 19.001.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee type contract will be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.  The Government anticipates the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on or about June 30, 2010.  The period of performance for this effort will be for a base period of twelve-months with two one-year option periods.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Mr. Michael DAlessandro at Michael.Dalessandro@us.army.mil.  All questions must be submitted in writing.   When released, the solicitation will only be available in electronic medium at US Army RDECOM Natick Contracting Division at https://www3.natick.army.mil

Included in the work is the demolition and reconstruction of asphalt parking spurs, and providing a slurry seal to all roads and spurs in the campground. New site amenities to be provided are fire rings, wheel stops, bulletin boards, and accessible concrete walkways. Concrete retaining walls and the placement of boulder barriers are also part of the work. This includes furnishing of all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, lodging, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work required under the terms and conditions of the resulting contract. Funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) will be utilized for this project. This acquisition is being advertised as a HUBZone set-aside and any resultant contract award will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 19, Subpart 19.1308.

The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. The Forest Service will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price. Technical factors when combined are approximately equal when compared to cost or price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

<a href="mailto:jeannette.bedwell@msfc.nasa.gov">Jeannette S. Swearingen</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for continued support of the Huntsville OperationsSupport Center (HOSC).	The HOSC provides multi-program facilities, systems and services,both local and remote, which support various mission phases of spacecraft payload andshuttle propulsion systems operations.	The HOSC capability supports all phases ofmissions including planning, testing, simulations, pre-launch, launch, and all aspects ofpayload flight operations.  The HOSC mission is to provide operations and maintenance(O&M) and system development services to meet International Space Station Program (ISS),Space Shuttle (SSP), and other program/project requirements.NASA/MSFC intends to continue the services from COLSA Corporation over a one yearextension period. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, whichimplements the authority for 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or servicesfrom only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1.  The one year extension of the COLSA contract will promote retention of critical SpaceShuttle Program (SSP) workforce through the end of the program, will allow for acontinued cross utilization of resources across programs, and will provide seamlessoperations support for the International Space Station (ISS) program.  COLSAs uniqueknowledge of HOSC operational environment, acquired since contract award, provides themwith specialized and intimate knowledge of operations, capabilities, requirements, andprocesses vital to the NASA Mission Ground Operations Systems Development andMaintenance, and the ISS & SSP multi-program functions. Failure to maintain a stable andcontinuous HOSC support workforce could have serious impacts to the safety of the SSP andISS Programs.2. COLSA currently supports, and has a unique knowledge of, the critical ISS ObsolescenceDriven Avionics Replacement (ODAR) project.  ODAR is performed onboard the ISS to replaceall of the avionics systems.  This replacement impacts the ISS ground systems that:provide the data transport, process the ISS payload and core systems data, collect thepayload developers science requirements,  model the onboard data system resources, andscheduling constraints,  and execute, model, and control the end-to-end data flow fromthe ISS.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon 6/2/2010. 4:00 p.m. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

LaunchReadiness Date (LRD) is to occur no later than December 31, 2017.  The proposed missionsmay target any body in the Solar System, including Mars and Earths Moon, but excludingthe Earth and Sun.Participation is open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S), includingeducational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally FundedResearch and Development Centers (FFRDCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL), and other Government agencies.  This solicitation will be open from June 7, 2010,through September 3, 2010.  Upon the release date, the full text of the AO and allappendices will be available electronically at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/   .	A preproposal conference will be held in late June or early July, in the Washington, DC,area; see http://discovery.larc.nasa.gov/   for details.Proposers should be aware of the following major changes in this AO from the DraftDiscovery Program AO (NNH10ZDA003J) released in December 2009:	Launch vehicles in the medium and high performance classes with 4m fairingswill be added as options. Costs to proposers for these options are currently beingassessed.	Proposed missions will be required to be compatible through PDR with threefamilies of launch vehicles: Atlas V, Delta IV, and Falcon 9.	The minimum requirements for taking advantage of technology-infusion cost capincentives will be detailed in a new document in the Program Library entitled In-SpacePropulsion Technologies Minimum Demonstration Requirements.	The costs associated with NEPA, NLSA, and nuclear launch services for missionsproposing to use ASRGs will be reduced to a firm, fixed cost of $20M (FY10).	The justification for the use of X-band telecommunications for science datadownlink will be clarified to explicitly follow Recommendation 23-1 of the SpaceFrequency Coordination Group: in deep-space X-band users will be limited to 12 MHz ofbandwidth while at Mars X-band users will be limited to 8 MHz of bandwidth.  Beyond theselimits, missions will be required to use Ka-band. Aperture fees based on the standardformula will remain.	Missions to the Martian surface will no longer be required to carry theElectra-lite UHF radio package. However, any UHF package used will be required to beinteroperable with the current Mars UHF relay network.	The latest allowable Launch Readiness Date (LRD) will be extended to December 31,2017.In addition to the listed major changes, this AO incorporates a large number ofadditional changes relative to the previous Discovery Program AO and the Draft DiscoveryProgram AO, including both policy changes and changes to proposal submissionrequirements.

<DESC>The Government intends negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) Sole Source contract with Roche Diagnostics, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Roche Diagnostics Magna Pure Reagents and Consumables. 

Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VA Long Beach Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as directed by the Participating Facilities: 

a.	VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS)
11301 Wilshire Blvd. 
Los Angeles CA. 90073
       ATTN: Pathology & Laboratory
		
b.	VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHC)
5901 E 7th street 
Long Beach CA. 90822
ATTN: Diagnostic & Molecular Medicine HCG

Nature of Acquisition:  Purchase of Roche Diagnostic's Magna Pure Reagents and Consumables.

Description of Requirement: The Contractor is to provide Roche Diagnostic's Magna Pure Reagents and consumables for the VALBHS and VAGLAHCS. Reagent and Consumable help assist the automation of patient samples, such as those used by Hepatitis Testing. 

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The requirements are being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1(a). The proposed contractor is the only company that can fulfill the requirements set forth by the VALBHS and VAGLAHCS. VALBHS and VAGLAHCS currently utilize Roche Diagnostic's Magna Pure system. There are no other brands that can supplement Roche Diagnostic's Magna Pure Reagents.

The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Consumable supplies and reagents must be purchased through Roche in order for the two VA Facilities to automate the preparation of patient samples using the Government owned Roche Magna Pure System. The Samples preparation system and Magna Pure Reagents are proprietary to Roche Diagnostics as are the consumable supplies for the sample processing.  

A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A notice will be publicized/synopsized for this procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.

Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate and past prices paid for similar services. 

Results of Market Survey: Market research was conducted. Roche Diagnostic has a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract. However, the reagent and consumables for this solicitation are not covered under Roche Diagnostic's GSA FSS Contract. Market research was also conducted to identify specific factors of this type of procurement utilizing the internet and phone conversations with FSS contractors and technical experts. There are several FSS contract holders with the ability to provide VAGLAHCS and VALBHCS with Patient Sampling. However, the cost to obtain new equipment for patient sampling will bring unnecessary cost to the Government. Due to the Proprietary nature of this acquisition, VALBHCS and VAGLAHCS encompasses only one specific vendor with the capabilities of providing the Government's needs.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by MedStar Research Institute (MRI) under NIA Contract N01AG31001. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. It is anticipated that Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, will be used and a single performance-based, cost reimbursable type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about April 1, 2010.
<p>The NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP) in Baltimore conducts human subject research in compliance with state and federal regulatory guidelines. In 1999 a significant addition to the mission was added to encompass interventional clinical trials and additional observational studies, in addition to the existing Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the longest continuous study of normative aging in the world. The expansion also included the implementation of a parallel, integrated, community-based approach to the study of normative aging identified as the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) program which is conducted in Baltimore neighborhoods. Accrual of this program's participant population began in October 2000. Successful methodologies have been developed that promote participation in clinical research among individuals from groups that have been traditionally under-represented in such research and who bear a disproportionate burden of age-associated disease and disability.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is planning to procure services for the expanded clinical research program to continue to develop translational clinical research, emphasizing aging and age-associated diseases. Translational studies represent the practical application of basic laboratory discoveries to the clinical setting, and as such, require an efficient synergism between those conducting basic research and those framing and conducting the clinical investigation. Successful translation of basic research requires coordination of the efforts by laboratory investigators, statisticians, physician-scientists, clinicians, and other patient-care providers. Strong linkages between the bench and the Clinical Research Unit enhance the likelihood of success for this bench to bedside approach. <br /><br />The NIA plans to operate the BLSA via the procured services. The objective is to continue to collect viable and useful longitudinal data on aging participants so that it may be used to expand the understanding of normative aging. The central focus of the research is to understand age-related changes in physiology and the ability to adapt to environmental stress. This understanding is then applied to developing insight about the pathophysiology of age-related diseases. The program seeks to understand the changes associated with healthy aging and to define the criteria for evaluating when a change becomes pathologic. Thus, not only are the common age-related diseases under study (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, cancer), but the determinants of healthy aging are also being defined. <br /><br />The HANDLS study will also be operated via the procured services. It is designed to evaluate normative age-related health disparities in minority and socio-economically diverse populations by going out into communities and collecting research data onboard three MRVs. The focal point of the HANDLS research program is on investigations specific to understanding the possible biomedical and behavioral basis of health disparities and designing effective preventive and therapeutic interventions for this population.</p>
<p>The Contractor will have the benefit and responsibility of working in concert with Federal managers, principal investigators and employees who have developed and currently work on these protocols. It is estimated that approximately 700 research participants will be seen per year at the stationary facility and approximately 1200 will be seen at the mobile research facility. The Contractor will provide all required support to execute these protocols, to include, but not limited to, recruitment and retention of participants, medical records processing and storage, IT management, testing (physical, psychological and physiological), biological sample storage and archiving, emergency medical care if needed, transportation, MRV support, scheduling, participant compensation, participant education, quality assurance, safety, protocol management, Institutional Review Boards as required, a licensed research pharmacy, laboratory support and staff support for approximately 110 FTEs to include unit orientation, training, travel, and etc. The Contractor may be required to subcontract for specific services as needed.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to assess its own procedures on a continuous basis and develop improved patient handling and testing procedures designed to (a) improve the viability of data collected (b) improve cost efficiency of operations and (c) increase volume of participants that can be safely processed.</p>
<p>The Contractor must meet the following four (4) qualification criteria at the time of receipt of proposal to be considered any further for award: (1) Performance of the work for this contract must be performed in Government furnished space. The Contractor must be able to provide staff, along with supervision of staff, in Baltimore, Maryland in: the 5th floor of Harbor Hospital, the Biomedical Research Center, the Gerontology Research Center and the Medical Research Vehicles. The Contractor must also be able to provide a limited number staff in Bethesda, Maryland where the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) has research activities; (2) The Contractor must be able to operate under current licenses to distribute drugs and other agents, including controlled substances and ethanol-containing products. Copies of these licenses must be provided in the technical proposal; (3) The Contractor's proposed Institutional Review Board (IRB) must be able to review the full scope of NIA protocols in areas of research specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). The Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number and documentation of the scope of the proposed IRB's capabilities to review diversity of NIA protocols must be provided in the technical proposal; and (4) The Contractor must have the ability to sponsor and provide visas for the purpose of employing documented workers from foreign countries when necessary.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.</p>

Proposed Issue Date:  On/about June 4, 2009Title of Project: 	    Remove Arsenic from Drinking WaterLocation: 		    Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada and Arizona
Description: The purpose of this project is construction of a new water treatment plant(s) at Temple Bar, AZ and at Cottonwood Cove, NV, both to remove arsenic from groundwater.  The project includes site work, structures, adsorptive media filtration treatment system, electrical and mechanical features, controls and alarms, and all components needed to provide treatment for arsenic removal at the Temple Bar (Mohave County) Arizona, and the Cottonwood Cove (Clark County) Nevada developed areas of Lake Mead NRA. This treatment will afford the Lake Mead National Recreation Area the capability to comply with law relative to the revised arsenic rule (of the Safe Drinking Water Act), which became effective January 23, 2006. Treatment consists of pre-filtration to remove sand, chlorine injection to oxidize arsenic and disinfect the water supply, adsorptive media filtration to remove arsenic, and additional chemical injection to inhibit corrosion in the distribution system. The existing treated water storage tanks at both sites will remain in operation and the water treatment plants are located near the existing water storage tanks at each site. The water treatment plants will be constructed using sustainable design and construction. Building construction and long term heating and cooling costs are minimized by placing the primary treatment equipment, adsorptive media filters, under a shade structure rather than enclosing them in a conditioned space. Installation of photovoltaic panels will offset a portion of each water treatment plant's energy consumption. Building architecture is consistent with Park standards, while matching the surrounding environment to the greatest degree possible. The Construction Contractor is responsible for maintaining water supply during construction.  Temporary water outages will be restricted during construction and startup to strategically planned periods in order to maintain the convenience of continuing park operations. The project schedule and sequencing shall provide for continuous water supply.
Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The Government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price as stated in the solicitation.
Estimated price range: $3.0M to $4.0M 
Time for completion, 300 calendar days; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. 
All responsible 8(a) sources may submit an offer that will be considered.NAICS:  237110
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small BusinessSearch for potential subcontractors iwthin these various socio-economic categories.  Small Disadvantaged Business and HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004) & 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (July 2005) (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic SB Search).

<DESC>The Ship Engineering and Analysis Technology (SEATech) Center, Code 3140, of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD), provides hardware and software resources required by the naval technical community.  The current procurement is for renewal of ANSYS Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and supporting software.  The licenses are for one year. In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA 15317. The small business set-aside has been dissolved. The contractor has unique qualifications when regarding this product. Fluent has unique capabilities such as analysis of two-fluid flows, usage of mesh adaptation, and availability of particular turbulence models. Several Navy projects are relying on the capabilities of Fluent for their analyses. Award to any other source through competition is not possible because ANSYS Inc. is the sole owner, developer, maintainer, and distributor of Fluent software. Therefore, ANSYS Inc. is the sole supplier. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 06/04/2010, referencing RFQ N00167-10-T-0083.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) requires a contract for a commercial solid-state 300V DC input power supply system comprised of quantity four (4) power supply units.  The DC power supply units must interchangeably interface with quantity two (2) Scandinova modulators that are proprietary to Scandinova Systems AB of Ultunaallen 2A, Uppsala, Sweden 75651.  In accord with the circumstances defined at FAR 6.302-1, the Government intends to award a firm fixed-price order for the required power supply, non-competitively, to Scandinova Systems AB.  
Non-competitive award is based on requirement of the DC input power supply units to interface compatibly, physically (they must have the same dimensions and interface as the existing 480VAC power supplies) and functionally, with quantity two (2) purchased Scandinova K1-3 modulators inherent to a Klystron amplifier manufactured by ETM Electromatic.  (The Klystron amplifier, with Scandinova modulators, comes standard with an AC power supply system suitable for a laboratory environment; the required DC power supply system represents an alternative, field-replaceable unit, suitable for reliably powering the amplifier in mobile/field environments.)  The Scandinova K1-3 modulators are proprietary to Scandinova.  It is unlikely possible / potential savings offered by an alternative supplier will justify the added risk to the performance and safety of the modulators, the value of the project, or the overall program.  The compatible DC power supply system shall be delivered, FOB destination (Dahlgren VA) within eight months of contract award.  
Questions and responses should be submitted, in Microsoft Word format, no later than __26 May 2010__ to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@NAVY.MIL and should reference this synopsis number: N00178-10-Q-3009.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Repair Generator for 420 KW Cat. Model#3412 (Edinburg, TX area)
<p><br />See attached pictures of the damage on 420 KW Cat.<br />Generator main winding:.</p>
<p>The damage that occurred during a short was extensive. This makes it very difficult to determine the root cause of failure in winding.</p>
<p>It was probably due to a breakdown in the insulation inside the slot, this is were the short appears to originate. The second closest speculation would be a phase to phase short which could have been caused by debris in the unit while it was running, such as a rag, small rock or rodent. <br />We did not find any debris in the unit during the disassembling process. Also the winding could have been wet, but usually when this is the case the winding fails on start up.</p>
<p>Here are a few common failures that can be ruled out:<br />(1) overload situation <br />(2) single phase situation.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>Disassemble unit surge test main winding, surge test and drop voltage<br />Test rotating fields, surge test exciter winding, surge test exciter fields, test diodes, measure machine fit<br />Rewind-Main winding, 420kw, 4-Pole<br />Dynamic Balance -rotating assembly</p>

<DESC>A/E Solicitation # 5192<br />User Facility for Net-Zero and Low Energy Buildings Research
<p>The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under a Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for professional Architectural/Engineering (AE) services for the LBNL Buildings Research Testbed Facility. Construction cost for the project is estimated to be between $8 to 9 million.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. It is an announcement for subcontracting opportunities with the University of California. Interested firms are encouraged to submit qualifications as indicated herein.</p>
<p>For information visit - http://facilitiesprojects.lbl.gov/, Reference No. 5192, - after May 19, 2010.</p>
<p>A.	PROJECT SCOPE SUMMARY <br />The AE firm will provide design services for the LBNL Buildings Research Testbed Facility. LBNL proposes to build and operate a novel user facility that addresses key technical challenges for net-zero (NZE) buildings. The Project will consist of a cluster of building technologies integration test beds (each 600-1,200 ft2) that will become a User Facility for Net-Zero (NZE) and Low Energy Buildings Research. The test beds will be designed and built on both the ground floor exteriors of LBNL Buildings 90 and 71, and will link the domains of simulated buildings, experimental buildings and real buildings. The facility will allow testing under controlled laboratory conditions as well as a lived-in office environment.</p>
<p>Multiple and/or redundant building system types may be provided for each test bed (e.g. two or three different HVAC systems installed, each capable of conditioning the space). The use of multiple discrete test beds will maximize user access to the facility, thereby increasing industry engagement and throughput. The proposed Building User Facility will advance DOE's goals for NZE and low energy research and will be used to validate and quantitatively demonstrate the value of whole-building systems integration (not just component efficiency improvements) in reducing energy consumption and improving the indoor environment.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the proposed LBNL Buildings User Facility will become a physical center for collaboration and innovation by drawing together public and private partners who share the goal of reaching NZE and low energy performance in new construction and existing buildings. While the facility will serve a national audience and need, LBNL will take maximum advantage of its location in a state that leads the country in aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency goals for NZE buildings.</p>

The intended outcome of this synopsis is to gauge industrys interest in the Agencys follow-on C2BMC effort and does not duplicate the proposed Enhanced C2BMC effort currently posted under FedBizOps Solicitation Number HQ0147-10-R-EC2BMC.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  This is an announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

2. Background:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (U.S.), and U.S. allies and friendly nations from ballistic missile attack.  The Ballistic Missile Defense System uses a layered approach which includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command and control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.   

The mission of MDAs Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) System is to provide a Combatant Command decision aid to integrate and globally synchronize missile defense systems and operations providing optimized layered missile defense against all ranges of threat, in all phases of flight.  The C2BMC System does this by collecting and processing ground and space-based sensor data (to include optical, radar and infrared) on ballistic threats into a discriminated, engageable system track (correlating traceable data from multiple sensors to target and guide interceptors to the lethal warhead) that is displayed to decision- makers, distributed to interceptor fire control units, and re-assessed for kill effects.  The result is an extended network of defensive sensors, shooters, battle managers, and intelligence assets.  The global C2BMC System spans the existing U.S. Combatant Command structure, allowing the warfighter to orchestrate and optimize U.S. ballistic missile defense response on a worldwide level. 

3. Description:

a. Request for Information (RFI).  

This Sources Sought Synopsis is being conducted by the MDA to gauge industrys interest in the Agencys follow-on C2BMC effort.  The information provided will support the Agencys Business Case Analysis (BCA) to determine the follow-on acquisition strategy for the C2BMC program. 

b. Current Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) Structure.

Currently the engineering, development, test, integration, fielding, and operations and sustainment of the C2BMC System is handled through a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with a consortium of five major defense contractors (known as the Missile Defense National Team C2BMC (Industry) [MDNTB(I)]).  The OTA was awarded on a sole source basis in February 2002, and will expire in December 2011.  Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Services is the C2BMC lead contractor, with The Boeing Company, General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Northrop Grumman Information Systems, and Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems as major teammates.  The team also includes a number of niche (specialty) subcontractors.  The MDNTB(I) works in a badgeless environment where:

 There is a single Statement of Work (SOW) for all teammates 
 There is no formal work share 
 There is one Award Fee pool  
 No one subcontractor is fully responsible for any one C2BMC capability

The MDNTB(I) works closely with Government Program Office staff (i.e., military, civilian, support contractors, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) personnel, and University Affiliated Research Center (UARC)) personnel in execution of program requirements.

c. C2BMC Program Requirements.  

1) Location of Performance:  Under the OTA, the MDNTB(I) is charged with the engineering, development, test, integration, and fielding of new C2BMC capabilities; and on-site operations and sustainment (including operational and depot maintenance)  support for the fielded C2BMC capabilities located worldwide.  Specifically the locations of work include:

 Pentagon, Arlington, VA 
 Ft Belvoir, VA
 Huntsville, AL 
 Colorado Springs, CO 
 Alaska
 Nebraska
 Hawaii
 Japan
 Germany
 Italy
 Israel

2) Organizations Involved:  The MDNTB(I) is responsible for working with multiple organizations in executing the OTA.  These organizations include, but are not limited to:

 U.S. Department of Defense: 
- Combatant Commands (COCOMs); [European Command (EUCOM), Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM), Pacific Command (PACOM), and Central Command (CENTCOM)] 
- Missile Defense Agency
- U.S. Air Force
- U.S. Navy

3) Work Activities.  The MDNTB(I) is responsible for the following:

a) Operations and Support. Sustain and maintain fielded C2BMC operational hardware/software (including all related AN/TPY-2 radar communications and C2MBC interface capabilities) on a 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year basis via, on-site support teams, C2BMC Control Center (CCC) operations, BMDS Network Operations and Security Center (BNOSC), and appropriate configuration management and sustaining engineering.  Provide the capability to respond to emergency operations and or integration of new technologies in response to changing threats.  Develop, maintain, and conduct operations and operational/support training for the operational C2BMC system, to include that used by friends and allies (where applicable).  

b) BMDS Communications Network Interface. Interface with long-haul communications provided by DISA, operating commands, and military Services.  The BMDS Communications Network (BCN) ties together sensors (both BMDS radars and space sensors) and weapons systems via the Combatant Command-Command and Control (COCOM C2) screens and Global Engagement Manager (GEM), enabling the National Command Authority and the commanders at the strategic, theater and tactical levels to optimally engage ballistic missile threats at any range, in any phase of flight, and at any time, including near simultaneous theater, regional and homeland attacks. The BMDS Communications Network builds on existing and new global grid data and communications networks to provide a robust, end-to-end, high availability, operational Communications Network (COMNET) infrastructure that quickly and unambiguously shares information across the global BMDS.  This sharing of information is performed securely with special emphasis on preventing cyber attack via the BNOSC.  Effective networking management and operations relies on the ability to manage, coordinate, and integrate a wide variety of equipment platforms; interfaces with other DoD communications systems; existing/evolving information standards and capabilities, and adherence to DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP).  DISA services are highly leveraged in providing world-wide communications.

c) Development of New C2BMC Capability.  The C2BMC Program employs a robust incremental development program to deliver enhanced and new capabilities to the warfighter.  Each increment of capability includes the software capabilities, hardware, network connectivity, training, and logistics support.  Technical capability requirements included in each software spiral are determined by the MDA Systems Engineering Directorate, in coordination with the C2BMC Program Office.  Current hardware capabilities include, but are not limited to, Enterprise Work Stations (warfighter display monitors and access to BMD Planner, Situational Awareness, and Battle Management information), servers, processors, communications racks and equipment, Situational Awareness web browsers, stand-alone laptop BMD Planners, and video distribution equipment.     

i. Systems Engineering.  Establish and follow a disciplined systems engineering process across the full spectrum of the C2MBC System, including configuration management, modeling and simulation, and test and integration  processes are critical to providing U.S. and international capabilities (where applicable).  

ii. Quality Engineering.  Implement a Parts, Material, and Process (PMAP) Program, an Operations Security (OPSEC) Plan, and comply with the MDA Security Classification Guide for secure development environment.  Conduct test planning, management, and analysis, support the MDA Program Control Board process, and transition capabilities to operations.  Incorporate internal and independent configuration audits as part of configuration control.  Include a specialty engineering program to include safety, reliability, maintainability, human factors and information assurance engineering and the development and verification of suitability design requirements.

iii. Hardware Engineering.  The C2BMC System uses Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) computer equipment to the maximum extent possible.  For the OTA follow-on activity in 2012 onward, the Government anticipates the hardware will require a major technology refresh activity in conjunction with the development of the new software spiral.  This technology refresh may span from updating key parts to a complete hardware infrastructure replacement.  The current commercial hardware infrastructure will be approximately ten years old and may reach the point that replacement is mandatory due to logistics support difficulties.  Additionally a new software build will be designed and built at the same time.  Replacement of the previous hardware suite may provide additional capability performance improvements that also justify replacement of the hardware.

iv. Spiral Development of Software Capabilities. The C2BMC Program uses spiral development (i.e., incremental development, test, and fielding) to produce the hardware, algorithms, software, network connectivity, and fielded support required to provide a system-wide, integrated ballistic missile defense capability.  As C2BMC products mature they are engineered and integrated into fielded spirals.  The average timeframe to develop and field a spiral is 24-36 months (depending on requirements and funding stability), with a new spiral fielded approximately every two years.  Multiple spirals are in staggered stages of engineering and development at any time.  Delivered spirals enable progressively increased abilities to plan ballistic missile defense, see the battle unfold on common Situational Awareness displays, remotely manage sensors worldwide, process track data to discern warhead and associated ballistic path and forward engagement information to BMD weapons systems (such as GMD, THAAD, PATRIOT, and Aegis BMD) across a global-grid communications network to defeat an adversary's attack.  C2BMC software capabilities are provided in four areas: BMD Planner, Situational Awareness, C2BM Network, and GEM. 

 BMD Planner: The BMD Planner provides warfighters the capability to explore the effectiveness of various defensive designs in order to plan the most effective defense by optimizing the location and mix/pairing of sensors and interceptors.  The BMD Planner allows the warfighter to function in three modes of activity: Deliberate Planning (24-36 months before a battle), Crisis Action Planning (hours or days before an attack, based on updated information), and Dynamic Planning (near real-time agility for changing situations).  System models used in the BMD Planner include the GMD system, AN/TPY-2 radar, Aegis BMD, PATRIOT, and THAAD.

 Situational Awareness: This capability is used to turn detailed data into usable information that commanders can act on in the event of a missile defense threat.  Situational Awareness information is provided by the COCOM C2 screens (displays and decision aids).  Situational Awareness display emphasizes a common ballistic missile picture and summary screens used at the Presidential level down to the operational level of command.  The systems available include an interface with the GMD Fire Control, and Aegis BMD and PATRIOT via Link 16, sensor management control of the AN/TPY-2 radar, and a direct data connection to SBIRS information.

 Command and Control, Battle Management (C2BM) Network:  The C2BMC System includes the communications network capability that is required to support the C2BM functionality, and the movement of data and information within the C2BMC Systems applications (i.e., the network capability specifically tied to the execution of the core C2BMC capability).  This is closely linked to, but not the same as the BMDS Communications Network referenced in paragraph 3.c.3.b, BMDS Network Communications.

 Global Engagement Manager (GEM): The GEM provides the first BMDS battle management capability through the C2BMC System. GEM provides the foundation for various BMD Elements and external sensors and interceptors to work synergistically for optimal performance.  The GEM will provide enhanced sensor management control of world-wide X-band radars, assign a specific sensor to track a specific threat, calculate the track of an incoming missile, and recommend the most effective weapon to target pairing, maximizing probability of hit/kill.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
In preparation for a future procurement, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to determine potential sources that are small businesses.  

The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide technical and analytical support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Compliance and Innovative Strategies Division (CISD) and other divisions within OTAQ.  CISD has the primary responsibility for implementing certification and compliance monitoring for programs for mobile source standards and rules promulgated under Title II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990 (CAAA).  OTAQ and CISD also pursue voluntary programs to encourage retrofits of existing vehicles and equipment.  CISD routinely supports other divisions engaged in activities including regulation development and engine/vehicle emission test programs requiring analysis and support.  CISD is responsible for quantifying and reporting fuel economy results from certain motor vehicles sold in the U.S.      
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Capabilities to provide economic, environmental, statistical, financial, and evaluative analysis support, (2) Capabilities to provide technical and engineering analysis support, (3) Capabilities to provide communication, outreach, guidance, and  regulatory program support, (4) Capabilities to provide web, computer system, and database support and development, and (5) Capabilities to provide support for implementation and compliance monitoring of air pollution regulations and programmatic requirements.  
The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained for the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Any interested firms should submit capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including personnel, experience, and qualifications.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. 
It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) with five one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 30,000 hours.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a size standard of $7 million. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). 
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  These capability statements are merely and aid to the EPAs market research efforts.  Respondents are advised that EPA is under no obligation to provide respondents with any feedback on the information received. Responses to the above should be submitted to Nicole Modafari, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268 no later than June 3, 2010.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC><p>SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION <br />Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule<br />&nbsp;<br />AGENCY: U.S. Small Business Administration.<br />&nbsp;<br />ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for <br />Herbicides, Insecticides, and Fungicides, under Product Service Code <br />(PSC) 6840, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) <br />code 325320, Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.<br />&nbsp;<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />SUMMARY: The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering <br />granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Herbicides, <br />Insecticides, and Fungicides, under PSC 6840, under NAICS code 325120. <br />According to a request, no small business manufacturers supply these <br />products to the Federal government. If granted, the waiver would allow <br />an otherwise qualified small businesses to supply the products of any <br />manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, <br />service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or Participants in the <br />SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program.<br />&nbsp;<br />DATES: Comments and source information must be submitted June 3, 2010.<br />&nbsp;<br />ADDRESSES: You may submit comments and source information to Amy <br />Garcia, Procurement Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of <br />Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW., Suite 8800, Washington, DC <br />20416.<br />&nbsp;<br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amy Garcia, by telephone at (202) 205-<br />6842; by FAX at (202) 481-1630; or by e-mail at Amy.garcia@sba.gov.<br />&nbsp;<br />SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act <br />(Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), and SBA's implementing regulations require <br />that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, <br />service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or Participants in the <br />SBA's 8(a) BD Program provide the product of a small business <br />manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual<br />manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly <br />referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. 13 CFR 121.406(b). Section <br />8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer <br />Rule for any ''class of products'' for which there are no small <br />business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the <br />Federal market. In order to be considered available to participate in <br />the Federal market for a class of products, a small business <br />manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation <br />or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 <br />months. 13 CFR 121.1202(c). The SBA defines ''class of products'' based <br />on the Office of Management and Budget's NAICS system and PSC to <br />further identify particular products within the NAICS code to which a <br />waiver would apply.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public is invited to comment or provide source information to <br />SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class <br />of product within 15 days after date of publication on FedBizOpps.gov.</p>

<DESC>1.0 DESCRIPTION:1.1 The Space and Naval WarfareSystems Command (SPAWAR) isseeking sources for the potentialdevelopment of Advanced TimeDivision Multiple Access (TDMA)Interface Processor (ATIP).  The ATIPis an advancement of the Navys TDMAInterface Processor (TIP), whichoperates on legacy Navy ExtremelyHigh Frequency (EHF) MDR capableterminals.  ATIP will include support forIPv6/IPv4 packet forwarding, AdvancedExtremely High Frequency (AEHF) XDRdata rates (up to 8 Mbps), improvedQoS, advances in dynamic TDMA slotassignment, and include backwardcompatibility to the TIP.  Thearchitecture will implement Layer-2Ethernet bridging among users that aregeographically dispersed andconnected via Milstar Medium DataRate (MDR), Advanced EHF BackwardCompatible MDR and XDR, or EnhancedPolar System XDR satellite links.  ATIPwill also allow users within each beamarea to share on an EHF/AEHF servicethe uplink on a dynamic TDMA basisand receive from other beam areas(other EHF/AEHF services) to provide afull duplex connectivity using halfduplex EHF/AEHF services.  Eachindividual service is denoted as a TDMASubnet and the collection of these forthe full duplex connectivity is denotedas a Supernet in ATIP terminology(and as used herein).  The ATIP isfunctionally divided into two elements:(1) the ATIP Processor (AP) and (2)the Terminal Interface (TIF).  It isanticipated that the AP will be aCommercial Off The Shelf (COTS)processor(s) circuit card assembly(CCA) with appropriate softwaredevelopment and that the TIF may beimplemented by a Field ProgrammableGate Array (FPGA) hardware/firmwareCCA(s).  The AP and TIF are connectedvia Ethernet to support variableinstallation configurations and eachelement will be rack mountable andmeet Navy platform environmentalrequirements.  Within the ATIParchitecture, the AP interfaces to up tosix (6) physical user network devicesand the TIF interfaces with up to eight(8) EHF/AEHF services.  The ATIPincludes the following functionalarchitecture components: NetworkInterface Function, Quality of Service(QoS) Function, Forwarding Function,TDMA Transmit and Receive (Rx)Processing Functions, Control/StatusMonitoring Function and TerminalInterface Function.  The first sixfunctional capabilities are intended tobe implemented in software within theAP COTS CCA.  The followingparagraphs summarize the ATIPcapabilities by functional architecturecomponent.1.1.1 The Network Interface functionprovides the connection to localnetwork devices to support the Layer-2Ethernet bridging function implementedby the ATIP.  ATIP assigns a singleEthernet interface per Supernet,supporting 10Base-T/100BaseTX/1000Base-T operation.1.1.2 The QoS and Forwardingfunctions are used to provide layer-2frame forwarding behavior inaccordance with user applicationdelivery needs as identified in aSubnet QoS policy.  QoS-based frameforwarding is performed separately byeach TDMA Subnet member incoordination with direction from theTDMA Net Controller (NC).  Using in-band protocols, members inform theNC of their traffic flows and the NCallocates bandwidth accordingly.1.1.3 TDMA Subnet Managementfunctions support establishment of theTDMA Subnet structure by the NC,member join/exit processing, memberstatus reporting to the NC, NC dynamicbandwidth assignment, and Subnet NCmanagement handover.  Subnetactivation and join are operatoractivated, but once Subnets are active,the member and NC autonomouslycoordinate status and dynamicresource allocation.The TDMA subnet structure (#timeslots per cycle, max # members,etc.) is established through NC periodictransmission of a Sequence Order List(SOL) message which contains theTDMA Subnet parameters as well asTDMA timeslot assignments for eachSubnet member.  Timeslots areassigned to members by the NC inresponse to member traffic flow reportsand the configured ATIP QoS policy.1.1.4 The TDMA Tx Processingfunctions support formation of TDMATransmission Units (TUs) based on theQoS / Forwarding policy, andtransmission of the TUs in the timeslot(s) designated for the member in theNC SOL message.  These packetsinclude both data packets andTIP/ATIP protocol messages betweenthe TDMA Subnet members and the NCmanaging the TDMA Subnet.  TUs willbe formed on a just-in-time basis,using TDMA slot timing informationfrom the TIF, and provided to the TIFfor transmission in the NC-assignedtimeslots.1.1.5 TDMA Rx Processing functionssupport extraction of data and protocolpackets from TUs provided by the TIFwhich were received over-the air,filtering out packets destined for thecurrent ATIP, and delivery of thepacket contents to the appropriateinterface.1.1.6 The Control/Status Monitoringfunction provides the operator interfaceto the ATIP.  Status Monitoringprovides ATIP operating status to theoperator, including hardware status,interface status, Supernet/Subnetoperation status, packet processingstatus, and ATIP event status (e.g.Subnet Join/Exit, NC handover, etc).ATIP Control supports receipt of ATIPconfiguration and operatingparameters from the operator,performing input parameterconsistency checks, and implementingthe specified configuration on the ATIP.The ATIP Control/Status Monitoringfunction will use a browser-based userinterface with Transport Layer Securityprotocol, eliminating the need for aseparate ATIP Operator Interfaceapplication program and specially-configured PC.  In addition, the ATIPControl and Status Monitoring functionwill support an Operator orderwirecapability.1.1.7 The Terminal Interface function(TIF) is responsible for exchangingATIP TU data with the crypto/EHFterminal in synchronization with thetimeslots allocated to the memberATIP on transmit and for all timeslotson receive.  Timeslot boundaries areidentified through receipt of TDMAtiming signals from the terminal whichare multiples of Subnet TDMAtimeslots.  TIF processing includes twokey sub-functions: (a) identification oftimeslot boundary for both uplink anddownlink and (b) serial exchange of TUdata with the crypto/EHF terminal usingstandard synchronous serial protocols.The TIF provides serial interfacestatus, including the detection ofEHF/AEHF service activation, to the APto support control/status monitoring ofATIP Subnets.2.0 SYNPOSIS TERMS - THIS IS ASOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OFSOLICITATION ISSUANCE.

Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users.

Federal law (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) authorizes under certain conditions, including only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency needs, contracting without providing for full and open competition. Exceptions are also authorized to the statutory requirements in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416), to provide public notice of contracting opportunities. 
Therefore,The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to award a contract to Greenbrier Wetland Services, a small hubzone business in accordance with 6302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) has an unusual requirement for a contractor to conduct a hydrogeomorphic (HGM) evaluation and ecosystem restoration and management options for Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge is re-evaluating current Refuge operations and developing resource management goals and comprehensive strategies to restore and provide for the long-term ecosystem health of Refuge wetlands. The intent is to develop a comprehensive management vision for the Refuge using wetlands hydrology and biology to guide planning and management decisions. Successful development of a management plan will require incorporating historic land conditions and ecological processes; identifying changes to the refuge's ecosystem and options to restore and manage for optimum function.  
The Refuge has identified the conduction of HGM as an integral component of achieving the comprehensive management vision. Greenbrier Wetland Services (Greenbrier) has the specific suite of skills necessary to meet the Refuge's goals including development and conduction of HGM processes. Greenbrier also provides other services that include research of waterfowl and wetlands, evaluation and monitoring, management and restoration plans, wetland determinations, strategic planning, and management of conservation and hunting properties.

The company specializes in obtaining and integrating information to understand basic ecological relationships of wetland types throughout North America and to evaluate and design appropriate options for restoration and management at landscape scales. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other vendors with this type of capability.
Award amount: $88,800.00
Period of Performance: Project completion date is one year from date of award.Companies that believe they can offer this service must respond in writing by e-mail to Alice_Wilson@fws.gov by 5/3/2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY .  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining industry comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a stewardship contract that will provide the services needed at the lowest possible cost or even negative cost to the Government in regard to the general requirement stated below.   The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. 


ProjectName:  
Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4-FRI) Project 

PROJECT INFORMATION:
The Southwestern Region (AZ and NM) of the Forest Service intends to perform a  large, minimum, multi-year forest restoration project in central Arizona under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects Act.  The overall objective is to treat approximately 1 million acres of ponderosa pine forest types by thinning and harvesting mainly small diameter trees in excess of ecological requirements under a number of 10-year stewardship contracts.  This process could take up to 20 to 30 years as contracts are awarded presupposing that the Stewardship Contracting Authority is extended.  This would yield up to 8 to 10 million CCF (100 cubic feet) of wood fiber.  The rate of treatments under the first contract is anticipated to be a minimum of 30,000 acres per year over a ten-year contract period.  It is expected that most treatment areas would accommodate ground-based harvest systems with some temporary road construction requirements and minor amounts of specified road reconstruction.  Areas proposed for treatment are scattered across four forests  Tonto, Kaibab, Coconino, and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  

The purpose of this request is to begin to identify issues specific to an RFP with regards to the needs of the forest industry.  For example: 
1.	How would you structure existing industries to efficiently harvest and utilize the full spectrum of available raw material which includes biomass, roundwood, and sawlogs.
2.	How would you propose to structure partnerships with other businesses that would enable costs for treatment to be at or near zero?
3.	How long would your plant take to construct and how long after award would you anticipate the plant starting production?  
4.	After start up, assuming there is a gradual increase to full production, how long do you anticipate that you would need to be at full production? 
5.	How long after contract award would you need to start harvest and removal of logs or other forest residue?
6.	How much wood would you project for the first year after award, what amount in year two, etc?  
7.	What amount of wood do you project needing at full production?  
8.	Would you prefer the contract be with your company, and you would subcontract to the logging companies; or would you prefer a logging contractor be the primary contractor with a separate contract with your company?


There is no formal contract at present, the exact acres to be treated have not all been identified, and the exact amount of wood to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.  However, a supply assessment has determined that there is a large sustainable supply for up to 20 years projected, and the Forest Service is confident that the volumes will be substantial and firm.  From this information it is projected that there will be more contracts of comparable size in the future.  

THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS:

Now is the time to provide us with any critical comments or ideas related to this project.  If there is something that we need to consider in developing the RFP, which will help make this project a success for all of us, whether it has been specifically asked or not, please let us know.  Once we begin putting the RFP together, we must maintain a considerable degree of confidentiality.  

We plan to solicit proposals late in calendar year 2010 or early 2011 and award in early to mid calendar year 2012.     
Submission Requirements:  
So that we may better determine capabilities and requirements for this prospective procurement, we request that you submit  your answers to the questions above and any additional comments or concerns you may have by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on Tuesday, June 1, 2010, with the title of the project (Four Forest Restoration Initiative Stewardship Project or 4-FRI) in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. The preferred method of communication is by email.  Due to volume of contacts, phone calls will not be returned.  Please send your responses to Henry Provencio, 4-FRI Team Leader at hprovencio@fs.fed.us and Rufus KI Cole, Contracting Officer at rcole01@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>RECOVERY: "THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE PRIME CONTRACTOR UNDER THE RECOVERY, TOWER CHEMICAL SITE CONTRACT NO. EP-R4-10-01 <br /><br />The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 4 issued this Contract for soil remediation at the&nbsp;Tower Chemical Company Site, located in Lake County, Florida. This requirement is under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). EPA Region 4 requires additional option quantities of soil remediation. This optional quantity of soil remediation is beyond the 49,850 CY in CLIN 0001 and the 5,000 CY in CLIN 0003. A new CLIN 0005 will be added for the additional&nbsp;soil remediation services. The dollar value of this new option quantity is $814,200, if exercised.&nbsp; The additional quantity is necessary because the rate of utilization of option quantity increments has been higher than originally estimated. The scope of the soil remediation services (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) remains unchanged. Additional soil excavation, transportation and off-site disposal of the soil triggered by confirmation sampling is necessary as the excavation proceeds and before backfilling with clean soil can occur. The option quantities, if exercised,&nbsp;will be ordered in 100 CY increments. The maximum not-to-exceed quantity is 100 - 100 CY increments (10,000 CY).
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition relative to this request is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), Only One Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The additional option quantities are inextricably intertwined with the work under the current contract. It is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements. In addition, site safety hazards such as personnel, trespassers or vehicles falling into open excavations are created by leaving an excavation open any longer than necessary. There is also an urgent need due to the continuing imminent and substantial threat to human health and the environment until the site is properly remediated. The justification for other than full and open competition document will be posted after issuance of this modification in accordance with FAR 6.305.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The 309th CMXG/Engineering Group is seeking quotes for the purchase of a Siemens multi-user license part number NX13420 and the associated upgrades under part NX 13420-MT. The proposed item shall include all freight and handling charges delivered to building 265 on Hill AFB, UT 84056.
<p>Siemens is considered the only one responsible source for the purchase of the NX13420 as authorized under 13.106-1 (b). The requested part(s) contain Siemens proprietary information and Siemens owns the data and rights. We could solicit to another company, but this would be extremely costly due to the need to re-establish the existing software. Hence the awarding to any other source would result in duplication of engineering, design, and software costs. The costs would not be recovered through the use of open competition.</p>
<p>RFQ should be submitted by 12:00pm MDT on 24 May 2010. Please refer to the solicitation for more detailed information.

<DESC>The goal of the Safer Warfighter Communications (SAFER) program is to develop technology that will enable safe, resilient communications over the Internet, particularly in situations in which a third-party is attempting to discover the identity or location of the end users, or block the communication. The technology developed in the program will also provide the quality of service (QoS) required to support applications such as instant messaging, electronic mail, social networking, streaming video, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), video conferencing, and other media that promote effective communication.
<p>The SAFER program addresses the resilience of information distribution and access on the Internet, including any and all technologies that allow anonymous Internet communications to bypass techniques that suppress, localize, and/or corrupt information such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Internet Protocol (IP)-address filtering or "blocking," typically by blacklisting the IP addresses of websites or other services, possibly by the network operator, to deny the user access</p>
<p>&bull; Domain Naming Service (DNS) hijacking, redirecting a user to a different website or service from what the user intended, by supplying a false reply to the user's domain name resolution request</p>
<p>&bull; Content filtering that captures and analyzes the content of the user's network traffic through deep packet inspection to check whether the traffic contains predefined signatures or sensitive keywords</p>

<strong>
<p>All evaluation factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<p>Evaluation Factor 1 - Past Performance</p>
</span>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a narrative on recent past performance that, at a minimum, addresses the four points listed below. This narrative shall clearly evidence the Contractor's ability based on past performance to perform the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW). Contact names and phone numbers shall be included in support of specific performance claims made in this narrative.</p>
<p>1. Quality of Product or Service - The Offeror must clearly evidence the ability to meet all space design requirements in accordance with the SOW.</p>
<p>2. Timeliness of Performance - The Offeror must clearly evidence the ability to meet established schedules or milestones in accordance with the SOW.</p>
<p>3. Cost Control - The Offeror must clearly evidence the ability to complete the space-related requirements within the established cost estimates in accordance with the SOW.</p>
<p>4. Business Relations - The Offeror must clearly evidence the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">

</span>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a narrative on the technical performance of this requirement that, at a minimum, addresses the technical aspects of the SOW and the factors listed below:</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">

Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)

Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs minimum requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information. 

 Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Such quotes may be determined unacceptable.  Award will be made to the lowest-price, technically-acceptable offeror.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the quote that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <BR>(1) meets the acceptability standards for non-price factors,<BR>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<BR>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<BR>(4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror,<BR>and (5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <BR><BR>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. (End of 52.212-2 Addendum); 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. (Offerors must complete FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications  Commercial items or do so on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov). <BR><BR>The following factors will be evaluated: Factor 1(TECHNICAL CAPABILITY). Factor 2 (PRICE). <BR><BR>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY. The offerors Technical Quote consists of written documentation (Factor 1).  The following adjectival ratings will be used in evaluating each offerors technical quote. To be considered technically acceptable, the offerors quote must receive a rating of satisfactory or higher.   <BR><BR><BR>ADJECTIVE	DEFINITION<BR>EXCELLENT<BR>	The quote demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The quote has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The quote has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The quote is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.<BR><BR><BR>GOOD	The quote demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The quote has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The quote has no deficiencies and any quote weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The quote generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.<BR><BR>SATISFACTORY<BR>	The quote demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The quote has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The quote has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The quote has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The quote meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of  successfully meeting the requirements.<BR><BR>MARGINAL	The quote fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The quote has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire quote.  The quote has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <BR><BR>UNSATISFACTORY	The quote fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The quote has major omissions, weaknesses or deficiencies, and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The quote presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR><BR><BR>PRICE (Factor 2) is not rated.  Price and cost analysis techniques will be used to evaluate an offerors proposed price.  Price will be evaluated for realism, value offered for the price, and extent, which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. Only those quotes considered technically acceptable will be further evaluated for price. (End of 52.212-2 Addendum).<BR>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 7 JUNE 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300044 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value. The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Evaluation factors for award will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quote. <br />The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.
<p>AIR HEAT EXCHANGERS, NSN: 1660-01-150-9084, P/N: 191390-2-2, the quantity of 03 each (Mfg cage code (70210) to be overhauled in accordance with IAW AFTO 15A4-113-3.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for unusually damaged items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300043 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value. The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Evaluation factors for award will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quote. <br />The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.
<p>BALLSCREW ASSEMBLIES, NSN: 1620-01-263-6733, P/N: 8430M4, the quantity of 14 each (Mfg cage code (00268) to be overhauled in accordance with IAW AFTO 16G3-2-87-3.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for unusually damaged items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Direct Attach Weapons  PMA-201, intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Archbald, PA, for the acquisition of Small Contained-Area Laser Preceision Energetic Load (SCALPEL) and engineering support services for the United States Navy. The objective of this effort is to contract with the Lockheed Martin Corporation to produce and deliver a limited quantity of weaponized  BDU-59B/B Enhanced Laser Guided Training Rounds (ELGTRs). These production qualification demonstration units will house a live warhead and fuze that meets the requirements of the ELGTR Performance Specification. The primary rationale behind this effort is to provide a low cost, lightweight, low-collateral damage weapon which can utilize the infrastructure and platform integration elements that already exists for the ELGTR system. Additional risk associated with potential configuration changes or invalidation of previously obtained ELGTR safety certifications and flight clearances for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft would be minimized. Lockheed Martin is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the ELGTR and the SCALPEL, and all associated technical data is proprietary to Lockheed Martin. As the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and supplier of ELGTR, only Lockheed Martin possesses the peculiar engineering capability, resources, expertise, intricate knowledge and proprietary technical data necessary to satisfy the Government's need and schedule requirements for the ELGTR weaponization process.This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available. Request for written information will be disregarded. A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought with Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, at the following address:   Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, 459 Kennedy Drive, Archbald, PA 18403, Attention: Mr. James F. Hughes. Once NAVAIR finalizes its requirements for the subject effort, a prerequisite for receiving a contract award is registration in the DODs Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. For more information on the CCR, contact the CCR Assistance Center at (888) 227-2423 or website at http://www.ccr.gov. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract. Inquiries may be emailed to Ms. Vicki Mudd at victoria.mudd@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Library of Congress is posting  solicitation LCFDL10R7500 for the FEDLINK Books and Library Publications Acquisitions Program.  This Request for Proposals (RFP) is for services from vendors who can supply books and library publications (non serial publications) and associated acquisition support services to federal libraries, information centers, and other federal offices worldwide.  The services of serials subscription agents and the acquisition of commercial online electronic resources are covered under separate LC/FEDLINK contracts and are not the subject of this solicitation.  The RFP is divided into four lots which define four different but related aspects of books and library publications acquisitions: LOT 1   Firm Order Services; LOT 2   Approval Plan Services; LOT 3   Leasing Plan Service; and LOT 4   Technical and/or Order Processing Services.  LOT 1 is the core of this solicitation &ndash; VENDORS MUST QUALIFY UNDER LOT 1 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNDER OTHER LOTS.   LOT 1 Firm Order Services covers firm orders; a one time order for a specific title (or specific titles) and number of copies, in contrast to a subscription or standing order.   Under LOT 2,    Approval Plans, a vendor automatically supplies materials potentially required by a library as they are published, based on a detailed profile of the library's collection needs.  The library may return any publications deemed unsuitable for addition to the collection and is only billed for items retained.  Under LOT 3,    Leasing Plan Services, the customer leases publications from the supplier instead of buying them and retains an option to purchase leased items at a reduced price when the term of the lease is over.  Under LOT 4     Technical and/or Order Processing Services, the vendor may provide technical processing for materials supplied under this solicitation, performing physical processing or cataloging in order to supply materials to the customer in shelf ready condition.  The vendor may provide a computer based order processing system for the customer to make the acquisitions control process more efficient.  Multiple awards are anticipated. Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to the solicitation are received and addressed prior to proposal submission.  All proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instruction provided in Section L of the RFP.  All questions shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the Contracting Officer via email as specified.  All questions concerning the requirements of RFP shall be submitted prior to COB June 1, 2010.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS will be accepted.

Introduction

The government is acquiring fuels management services by use of mechanical equipment to treat vegetation to reduce the risk of wildland fires, enhance ecosystems and improve wildlife habitat.

Background

The purpose of this contract is to secure mechanical treatment services to create and maintain fuelbreaks, and to be used for forest health activities on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.  Vegetation types and terrain differ from around the forest which may include reforestation areas, natural and managed stands of timber of all ages, size and species, and shrub fields. Vegetation to be treated will require cutting, chipping, shredding and mulching.  The treatment will reduce ladder fuels and rearrange natural vegetation to a state that will burn with reduced fire intensity during a wildfire event.  Firefighter safety will be improved as well as a reduced threat to the public and private property.   The work shall be done in a manner that does not damage vegetation not specified to be treated.

Scope of Contract

The services in this contract are designed to provide for wildfire hazard reduction, ecosystem enhancement and improve wildlife habitat.  Mastication treatments can take place at any point during the year as long as weather, ground conditions and fire conditions allow for.

Other fuels reduction activities not priced on the schedule of items are suject to negotiation.

The technical point of contract for information on the potential task orders is Steve Howell of the Carson Ranger District.  showell@fs.fed.us,   Desk: 775-884-8114  Cell: 775-721-2064.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to unarchive and to extend the response date of this announcement through June 3, 2010.           

The Office of Naval Research intends to award a cost plus fixed fee, sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302 on or about 1 July 2010, for a 33 month base period with 2 one year option periods to Systems Planning and Analysis Incorporated, Arlington, Virginia.  This is not a solicitation as the award is an intended sole source; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by ONR.
          The prospective contractor, Systems Planning and Analysis Inc. (SPA Inc.) shall provide The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Code 32 with technical engineering, research, specifications for vehicle development, trade off-studies using N81 OPNAV approved scenario models that include unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) and specific simulations and integration scenarios using UUVs for the Persistent Littoral Undersea Surveillance (PLUS) program.  ONR also requires new model code developments to include acoustic and non-acoustic detection technologies and signal processing in high level technical simulation modeling.  Expert interpretations of model results are required and the results will need to be converted to time tables and field trials of real technologies into fleet experiments.  The work will be performed both onsite and offsite.  A Secret and Top Secret/SCI level clearance.
          SPA Inc has been selected for this sole source award because they are the only firm that posses an in-depth understanding and the capability to program new applications and modules in the General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM), which was developed by the firm.  The Government requires specific reprogramming of GCAM to include UUV elements.  No other firm has programmed GCAM and customized code to represent PLUS UUV technologies.  SPA developed GCAM for using PLUS-specific representations in the General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM) and has an in-depth understanding of GCAM and the ability to execute the operational aspects of the experiment.
