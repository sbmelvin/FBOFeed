<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<br />1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors suitable for use in the en route care environment. Responses are due to this request for information (RFI) by 2:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 13 September 2012.<br />2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned. AFMESA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future request for proposal (RFP).<br />3. BACKGROUND: Air Mobility Command (AMC) has identified a need for a device with the ability to monitor ICP non-invasively. The ICP monitor sought should be able to measure ICP and/or use a surrogate to reliably predict ICP without breaking the patient's skin. Current methods require an invasive catheter which is not ideal for en route care environments. Therefore, AMC is seeking a non-invasive device to measure ICP in austere environments.<br />AFMESA is collecting information on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), and foreign off-the-shelf and research and development (R&amp;D) projects in relation to ICP monitoring. <br />4. REQUIREMENTS: The ICP monitor sought must operate in a variety of austere environments, including the en route care environment. The ICP monitor should meet the following high level requirements:<br />1. Device should be "approved for market" (PMA), "cleared to market" (510k), or "legally marketed" (as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations - 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3) for Class I and II devices). <br />a. For R&amp;D and prototype projects, must anticipate submission to FDA.<br />2. Device must detect ICP and/or use a surrogate measurement that reliably predicts ICP.<br />3. Device must be non-invasive.<br />4. Device must be man-portable.<br />5. Device should be able to meet all Department of Defense (DOD) Airworthiness Certification, Joint En Route Care Equipment Test Standard (JECETS), and Military Standard MIL-STD-810G.
<p>Manufacturers are encouraged to submit responses to this RFI, even if a system does not meet all the requirements. For requirements that are not met, trade-offs will be considered. <br />&emsp;<br />5. RESPONSE INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Ms. Ashley Fredlock, Market Research Analyst, via e-mail to AFMSA.SG5T.Market@detrick.af.mil. Email responses should be no larger than 10 megabytes (MB) in size. If larger attachments are required, please notify AFMESA at the above listed email address. Each RFI response will receive a confirmation email; if a confirmation is not received please call 301-619-8600. Please include a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, and indicate whether the company is a foreign or domestic entity in the contents of the e-mail.<br />Responses must be received by this office on or before 2:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 13 September 2012. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information. <br />The response should describe the company's capability to offer, field, and sustain the ICP monitor as characterized by the requirements addressed in this RFI. If unable to provide a non-invasive ICP monitor capable of meeting all requirements, the respondent should offer tradeoff considerations.<br />Please ensure responses specifically address each requirement listed in section 4, Requirements. At minimum, please complete and return the table provided below. Additional detailed information is encouraged.<br />6. LATE SUBMISSIONS: Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future requests for proposals. Communications with AFMESA in regard to this RFI will only be permitted in writing during the RFI response period.<br />Responses to the RFI received by AFMESA after the submittal deadline and time indicated may be considered. The respondent assumes the risk of the method of dispatch chosen. Postmarking by the submittal date and time shall not substitute for actual response receipt.<br />7. OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSE TO RFI: All informational material submitted in response to this request becomes property of AFMESA. Physical samples will be returned to the vendor at the owner's expense. <br />8. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPARATION EXPENSES: Under no circumstances shall AFMESA be responsible for any response preparation expenses, submission costs, or any other expenses, costs, or damages of whatever nature incurred as a result of the respondent's participation in this RFI process. Respondent understands and agrees that they submit a response at their own risk and expense, and release AFMESA from any claim for damages or other liability arising out of the RFI process.<br />9. ERRORS IN RESPONSE: AFMESA shall not be liable for any errors in respondent's response. Respondent is responsible for careful review of its entire response to ensure that all information is correct and complete. Respondents are liable for all error or omissions contained in their responses.<br />10. ADDENDUM: AFMESA reserves the right to issue an addendum to this RFI at any time for any reason.</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes.
A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Monday August 17, 2012 by sending an e-mail to valarie_reinholz@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 1 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed priced BPA to: COMPANY: RUAG Ammotec USA  DUNS: 832426261   FOR : Ammunition, through 30MM for the US Fish & Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement  NAICS: 332992 SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION MANUFACTURING   AUTHORITY: 8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement requires newly factory manufactured ammunition that is owned by the Service for use by Service law enforcement officers (442 FWl.  1.6 A) and (Law Enforcement Memorandum 45 (LE-45).  The Service also requires ammunition be made available to Service law enforcement officers for training and qualification (442 FW 1, 1.6 B)  LE-45 allows for Service the Branch of Training to consult with the Firearms Committee to use non-toxic and frangible ammunition for training & qualifications.  The October 1, 2009 memorandum from the SAC, Branch of Training & Inspection authorizes the use of non-toxic and frangible ammunition for use by special agents. In June 2012, the Office of Law Enforcement Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) Team, authorized under Chief's Directive-A23 (CD-A23), tasked the Firearms Committee, authorized under 442 FW 1, 1.12 A, to produce a recommendation for standard ammunition for use by Service special agents.
The Office of Law Enforcement, Firearms Committee recommended the ammunition  Rheinisch Westfalischer Sprengstoff(RWS) Copper-Matrix Non-Toxic Frangible manufactured for  RUAG Ammotec USA, Inc. as the preferred ammunition for use by Service Special Agent for training and as an alternative to duty ammunition for qualifications.  The ASAC Team accepted the recommendation to make the RWS Copper-Matrix NTF offered by RUAG Ammotec ammunition the standard training ammunition for Service special agents.  The RUAG Ammotec, RWS Copper Matrix NTF ammunition completely pulverizes into fine powder upon impact.  This provides the ability for Service special agents to use this ammunition in training at close range, virtually at point blank range, and on steel targets safely without fear of back-splash causing injury.  The RWS Copper-Matrix NTF frangible ammunition for pistols and rifles retain the same point of impact, recoil and muzzle flash as standard duty ammunition.  The Sintox lead-free primer used in the RWS Copper-Matrix NTF rounds assures this NATO qualified ammunition ammunition is lead-free and environmentally compliant on non-lead firing ranges.  RUAG Ammotec USA, Inc. is the only company that offers the RWS Copper-Matrix NTF lead-free frangible ammunition.  The RWS Copper-Matrix NTF rounds have been tested by the Service Special Agents and have been found to meet all needed requirements for a non-toxic training round that is provided through RUAG Ammotec USA, Inc. a sole source for this product.
RUAG Ammotec USA, Inc. is the sole source manufacturer and distributor of the RWS Copper Matrix NTF round in the U.S.A..  Purchasing directly from the manufacturer is to assure the ammunition meets the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) specifications, is newly manufactured, and is meeting the highest quality.  Additionally, ordering directly from RUAG Ammotec USA, the large quantities needed to supply enough ammunition for training can only be provided from the manufacture to minimize the number of lots in case of a recall and quality control perspective.
The manufacturer provides a discount for law enforcement in the form of lowering the price to adjust for the Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax (FAET). For more information contact Valarie Reinholz at 541-488-6504 or valarie_reinholz@fws.gov

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>
