<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), on behalf of Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (C3T), Program Manager Tactical Network (PM TN), Product Manager Network Modernization (PdM NetMod) intends to negotiate with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) on behalf of Ultra Electronics - Tactical Communications Systems (Ultra TCS), 5990 Cote de Liesse, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H4T IV7, CAGE code L1084 as a sole source in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, to procure Terrestrial Transmission Line of Sight (TRILOS) Radio Systems, components, development of logistics documentation, and support services. The action proposed is a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five (5) ordering period with a ceiling amount of $497,220,602.00. The anticipated award date is second quarter fiscal year (FY) 2019.
<p><br />Only the Orion X500 radio (main component of the TRILOS Radio System) manufactured by Ultra TCS meets all the Government's needs, due to the radio's unique capability for backwards compatibility with the currently fielded HCLOS radios, manufactured by Ultra TCS. This backwards compatibility is achieved through the HCLOS proprietary waveform owned by Ultra TCS, a capability that exists in the currently fielded HCLOS radios and the proposed Orion X500 radio. Backwards compatibility is required to ensure that the procured radio can interoperate Over-The-Air (OTA) with the legacy HCLOS system. OTA interoperability will also ensure continuity of operations during a multi-year fielding process and provide communications compatibility between WIN-T increments as TRILOS radios are integrated and replace the legacy HCLOS ones. A market research confirmed that the Orion X500 radio manufactured by Ultra Electronics TCS is the only existing radio that meets all of the Government's requirements. Market research also confirmed that procuring GPR of the HCLOS waveform would result in higher costs, duplicate costs, and delays to fielding which would subsequently affect the warfighter.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

All responsible sources may submit offers which, if received in timely fashion, shall be considered.<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx. <br />Important Note on Foreign Content: <br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment" impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.<br />-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------<br />Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.<br />DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.<br />The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/<br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance.)<br />

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Low-Light, Low-Noise Spectrometer
<SOLNBR>1333ND18QNB680012
<RESPDATE>042018
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Roper Scientifics, Inc (Princeton Instruments), 3660 Quakerbridge Rd, Trenton, NJ, 08619-1208 for the purchase of a low-light, low-noise spectrometer system for NIST's Quantum Measurement Division (QMD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>NIST requires a low-light, low-noise spectrometer system for conducting frequency domain measurements in association with quantum optics experiments. The mission of the Quantum Optics Group of the Quantum Measurement Division is to develop and characterize measurement methods that take advantage of the quantum nature of light so as to achieve better performance, uncertainties, or to enable new applications that are not possible with classical methods. Typically, these measurements are of single quantum states, and thus are done in very low-light environments. Therefore, one of the most important aspects of the research is the measurement of this light via a spectrometer. To meet these mission needs the low-light, low-noise spectrometer system will be used in this device, and/or parts of this device to spatially and spectrally image the output of single photon sources that occur in a broad range of processes, including biological systems.</p>
<p>Roper Scientifics, Inc (Princeton Instruments), is the sole source Contractor for this product.  The reason is they are the only company that can provide an accurate and precise spectral characterization, while being compatible with extremely weak classical and quantum light sources in a broad range of optical and near-IR wavelengths. In order to meet these needs the system must be compatible with weak signal sources, the spectrometer should have low insertion loss, and the camera(s) that comprise the said system should be both highly efficient and low noise. Because the cameras comprising this system are unique, it is required for them to be versatile and allow standalone imaging operation. To ensure turnkey operation, the entire system (that is, the monochromator and cameras) should be calibrated and operated by one software suite.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Plexon, Inc. for linear multiple-electrode arrays. The purpose of this order is to procure linear multiple-electrode arrays to be used in electrophysiological experiments to investigate the neural response properties in multiple brain areas during the process of curvature.  <br /><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source.  (1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).<br /><br />The NIH Molecular Imaging Branch requires linear electrode arrays to  1) image curvature is one of these fundamental visual dimensions and, as such, 2) curvature-selective cells are grouped together in discrete cortical areas.  Using neuroimaging techniques, we confirmed this hypothesis, and localized the curvature-processing sites in extrastriata visual cortex.  These sites lay along a common cortical strip, spanning lower- to higher-level processing stages.  Furthermore, the curvature-processing sites are adjacent to the well-known face-processing cortical areas, suggesting a possible functional link between them.  The study is currently under revision for publication (DIRP Publication and Abstract Clearance Request #113942).  No other product is available that can meet this need. <br /><br />The applicable NAICS Code is 541715 and the employee number standard is 1,000.<br /><br />Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding.

This purchase is to provide a chair for comfortable, safe and stable positioning of the subject. The Laboratory of Neuropsychology requires these chairs to complete the laboratory and enable research aimed at elucidating the circuitry involved in perception, memory and decision-making.<br /> <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span><br />The contractor shall provide a Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Chair for behavioral training and neurophysiological recordings for the National Institute of Health, National Institute of Mental Health IRP. The Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Chair will come with front fixed panel trolley included and are designed to enable researchers to restrain primates effectively in a wide variety of research scenarios which can range from standard vision studies to complex behavioral experiments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Other Important Considerations</span><br />CRIST INSTRUMENT is a woman owned small business located in Maryland, United States.  100% of the products are manufactured in the United States and majority of materials are from the United States.  CRIST INSTRUMENT is the only vendor that offers an acceptable Lead Time of 6-8 weeks.  Other vendors have a lead time of 6 months (not acceptable).  Another factor to consider: National Institue of Health has an existing Blanket Purchase Order BPA HHSN263201500066B for Purchase Orders up to $25,000.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</span><br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research, specifically the review and evaluation of the responses to the sources sought notice published in the FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>CRIST INSTRUMENT CO is the only company that can fulfill the government requirement.  No other vendors are able to provide this product with an acceptable lead time of 6-8 weeks.  All search methods, including GSA and search engines were utilized enabling research especially with non-human mammals.  CRIST INSTRUMENT CO produces American-made products enabling biomedical research discoveries.  CRIST INSTRUMENT CO has a longstanding relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Health and an existing Blanket Purchase Order BPA HHSN263201500066B for Purchase Orders up to $25,000.</p>

The P-8A acoustics system is based on the system used in the Lockheed Martin P-3 Orion. Intimate knowledge of and expertise with the ABA, the AMG, the NSC, and the acoustics system are required in order to meet requirements in a timely manner. If a small business, provide a description of the plan for ensuring that the small business performs at least 50% of the work itself in terms of cost of performance.<br />(3) Experience: An outline of previous relevant projects, specific relevant work previously performed or being performed.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center, Norfolk, Contracting Department, intends to modify an existing order N00189-16-P-Z492 and acquire 10,000 additional Thursby licenses and associated software maintenance in support of the various software products that are currently being utilized by CNRFC to operate its Ready-2-Serve (R2S) responsive website on the Navy Reserve homeport. The website serves as a critical communication tool for CNRFC. R2S is designed to improve the capability to rapidly deliver Selected Reservists (SELRES) to the supported commander.  The secure R2S integrated mobile application requires DoD PKI 2-factor authentication from the mobile device. R2S users must have an approved U.S.
DoD Common Access Card (CAC) reader and a Navy Reserve Homeport user account to use the application. The specific software application being procured is a modified version of the PKard to make it specific to the Navy Reserves Ready-2-Serve website, Thursbys resellers do not have authority to sell this product and can only be acquired directly from Thursby Software Systems, Inc. CNRFC has already acquired 35,000 licenses so changing to another vendor would not be cost effective and would require extensive software redesign to allow the other vendors function properly with the R2S Thursby readers already acquired.

This is a brand name sole source action is to be awarded to Thursby Software Systems and it is not a request for quote from any other contractor.
The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 1901(e)(2)  a sole source acquisition under the Special Rules for Commercial Items, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a capability statement. The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
The applicable NAICS code is 511210. Please direct any questions concerning this purchase order to Aleksandar Rajcic at  aleksandar.rajcic@navy.mil.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY:  VitalTag:  In a mass casualty incident, every second counts. Emergency medical services personnel must move quickly to triage, treat, and transport patients. In this chaotic environ-ment, it is impossible to watch over every patient. To address this gap, a device is needed that can simultaneously collect and display a patients' vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oxygen, and electrocardiogram.  The VitalTag is a wearable, cost-effective, disposable sensor that can be easily applied to each patient's chest to generate enhanced situational awareness of patient status. Responders can see each patient's medical status and location on a map. The VitalTag securely detects, wirelessly transmits, and dis&not;plays vital signs in real-time through a mobile app. If a patient's status changes, the system alerts responders so they can quickly locate the patient and provide care. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed and prototyped the VitalTag technology, and it is currently patent pending.  PNNL is actively seeking commercial partners that are interested in licensing the technology to develop commercial products for several markets that range from emergency medical response to performance sports. For more information please go to: https://availabletechnologies.pnnl.gov/technology.asp?id=478</p>
<p><br />For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 31239.</p>
<p>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 31239.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
Repackaged and Controlled Substance Destruction

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  Appropriate disposition of repackaged controlled substances with notification to any and all oversight agencies, as necessary.

 a. BACKGROUND: Medication that is damaged, expired or otherwise unusable cannot be distributed to Veteran patients. The pharmacy may accumulate repackaged items including medication processed into patient prescriptions, repackaged items for use within the facility and other items removed from original packaging. Medication not in the original packaging from the manufacturer cannot be returned for credit and are potentially deemed pharmaceutical waste or unusable product. Items must be disposed of in a manner that is safe for the environment and in keeping with all current and future laws & regulations. In the case of a controlled substance, a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Form 222 must be generated to account for the removal of schedule II controlled substances from the facility and other paperwork must be filed with the DEA once the destruction has occurred. Schedule III, Schedule IV and Schedule V controlled substances will be inventoried and a complete list shall be provided to the facility. Full and complete accountability is expected for all controlled substances, to include web-based tracking and reporting tool.

 b. OBJECTIVE: To have pharmaceutical product, including controlled substances, removed from South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) sites and disposed of properly in accordance with all current DEA rules and applicable regulations. If paperwork is required by an oversight agency such as the DEA, the contractor shall generate the appropriate paperwork or have it available through the web-based tracking and reporting tool. Copies of any and all regulatory paperwork shall be timely sent to or left with the STVHCS pharmacy station.

 c. SCOPE OF WORK: Unusable medication identified by the pharmacy, including controlled substances, shall be removed from the listed facilities every other month with potential of  ad-hoc  pick-ups as requested. There are four (4) main facilities, with the possible inclusion of secondary Veterans Affairs (VA) locations. Paperwork including, but not limited to, a DEA Form 222 shall be generated and a copy will be provided and stored within the pharmacy narcotic vault prior to the removal of medications from the facility. All repackaged controlled substances shall be shipped by the contractor, at no cost to the VA, directly from the pharmacy to the contractor s designated processing facility. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NOISH) listed repackaged substances shall be disposed of in accordance with all regulatory requirements. Web-based tracking and reports, including but not limited to DEA form 41, shall be made available to each facility for each visit or pick-up.

List of Sites:
*Audie L. Murphy VA Hospital, San Antonio, Texas
Frank M. Tejeda Outpatient Clinic, San Antonio, Texas

<p>9. Potential Offerors will be expected to show their capabilities and capacity to accomplish Research and Development dealing with this main objective which is to define the impact of the Earth's space environment on Air Force systems and to achieve a capability for specifying, predicting, mitigating, modifying, and exploiting the effects of the space environment that can disrupt or degrade Air Force operational systems. The Air Force Research Lab's research efforts generally fall into three main technology topic areas: (1) Solar, solar wind, and ionospheric effects; (2) thermosphere and satellite drag and the reentry environment; and (3) plasma physics and chemistry. Current activities include forecasting of solar and interplanetary conditions which cause electromagnetic interference and geomagnetic disturbances; understanding, specifying, and ultimately predicting the state of the Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere, including the associated electric fields and field-aligned currents; quantifying environmentally induced effects on space and ground systems; and developing and applying active techniques for space environment mitigation, modification, or exploitation. Detailed knowledge of the space environment impacts have important implications for issues of radio frequency (RF) wave transmission, propagation, and remote sensing; positioning, navigation, and timing; and satellite orbits and reentry. The following <strong>anticipated Technical Topic Areas</strong> are expected to be included in the FULL TEXT BAA posted in FY19, with only minor changes, as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>a) Solar, Solar Wind, and Ionospheric Effects<br /></strong><br />The solar energetic emissions that impact Department of Defense (DoD) systems include both quasi- continuous sources, such as the solar wind, as well as sudden violent eruptions such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The objectives for the Solar and Solar Wind Effects research effort are to (1) provide improved solar models, including electromagnetic radiation, energetic particles, and plasma, that impact the space environment and support operational end user products and tools; and (2) develop and improve space- and ground-based solar and heliospheric instrumentation and data products necessary to drive the models research thrusts which include: improved radiation (F10.7, EUV) modeling and forecasts; development of an operational state-of-the-art 3-D Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) coronal/solar wind model and a coronal mass ejection (CME) propagation model; development of solar activity, flare, and CME specification and prediction tools; development of specialized solar instrumentation to observe solar signals from ground and space; analysis of solar ground and space data from imagers and spectroscopic probes; numerical and physics based modeling of solar processes and assimilation of data into the models; and development of models of the near- and far-term solar impacts on space weather including solar specification models and predictive and forecast physics-based models.<br />The fundamental concern underlying RVBX's ionospheric research is the geospace environment's effects on space systems and services, since the state of the ionosphere affects the degree to which an operational system can meet requirements for assured delivery of communications or for robust positioning, navigation, timing, surveillance, or reconnaissance information, or whether the transmissions will be degraded or disrupted. System operators or users must determine whether poor or aberrant system function is due to environment effects or other causes. Meeting this need requires capabilities to: (1) determine and demonstrate the detailed association between environmental conditions and specific impacts on space systems and services; (2) establish the utility of environmental models to specify or forecast specific conditions, or proxies for those conditions, that cause impacts on space systems and services; and (3) quantitatively characterize the occurrences of specific environmental effects on space systems and services. An important aspect of the research focuses on improvements in diagnostic technologies that allow ionospheric properties related to impacts to be detected, measured, and studied.<br /><br />Accordingly, research activities cover a broad range; general areas of effort include: (1) basic and applied research into ionosphere and thermosphere coupling during quiet and disturbed conditions; (2) basic and applied research into the stability of the equatorial, subauroral, auroral, and polar ionosphere during quiet and disturbed conditions; (3) space environment impacts on positioning, navigation, timing, and communication systems and radars; (4) improved high frequency (HF) Geolocation capabilities as well as modeling of HF skywave propagation; (5) the causes of electromagnetic interference on RF systems; and (6) data collection, analysis, and data archiving supporting the technical efforts. In addition to the scientific/technical activities cited above, topics for potential CALLs include: development of a real-time monitoring system for equatorial ionospheric plasma drifts, incorporating data from a variety of sensors; development of a model of global ionospheric scintillation based on ground and satellite measurements; development of a forecast model for equatorial plasma bubbles and irregularities; development of a first-principles model for nowcasting and forecasting global ionospheric electrodynamics; development of ionospheric modeling techniques specifically designed to increase the accuracy and timeliness of bottomside ionosphere profile specification and forecast; development of multi- model ensemble techniques applied to ionospheric specification and forecast; physics based and/or phenomenological modeling of traveling ionospheric disturbances; development of automated techniques for extracting the characteristics of transient ionospheric features, such as traveling ionospheric disturbances, from existing measurement networks; full wave or ray-based modeling of point-to-point RF propagation, especially efforts directed towards enhanced implementation on modern computational systems; development or improvement of ionospheric specification sensors including, but not limited to, low cost and/or low power ionosondes, scintillation receivers, beacons and/or beacon receivers, GPS receivers, and optical systems; development of low cost Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) components to help support a global AMISR network; development of tools for ionospheric phase screen reconstruction using available ionospheric sensor data including, but not limited to, SATCOM receivers, LEO (Low Earth Orbit) beacon receivers, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers. The latter includes development of a frequency scaling capability based on empirical models and/or phase screen reconstructions.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>b) Thermosphere and Satellite Drag and the Reentry Environment.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this research area is to develop empirical and physics-based models, sensors, and data products to accurately specify and forecast the neutral atmosphere and satellite drag in order to identify space objects that orbit the Earth, to provide precision orbit determination and prediction, including re-entry predictions, and to assess the likelihood of collisions. Meeting these needs require an accurate climatology of the various orbital regimes, knowledge of present and forecast conditions, and expected impacts on operations.<br />A major source of error for orbital determination and prediction for satellites operating below about 600 km is aerodynamic drag. The two most important influences on satellite drag are thermospheric neutral densities and neutral winds, but at satellite altitudes the density and wind models do not adequately account for dynamic changes in these fields, leading to significant errors in predicted satellite positions. Relevant research activities in this area include: 1) quantifying the energy input into the thermosphere during both quiet and active solar conditions; 2) developing empirical, physics-based, and data assimilative methods for global specification and forecast of the thermosphere/ionosphere system; 3) developing satellite- and ground-based instrumentation for sensing the neutral and ionized upper atmosphere; 4) predictive modeling of space weather conditions and events impacting the thermosphere and ionosphere system; and 4) developing an orbital propagator and orbital drag error estimator.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; c) Plasma Physics and Chemistry.<br /></strong><br />The plasma physics and chemistry investigations cover a variety of plasma states, from collisional to magnetized, as well as a variety of compositions, including typical atmospheric species as well as exotic neutral and ionized species and their reactions. Work is also done on plasmas of interest to the greater DoD mission, e.g., we are looking into plasma chemistry relating to the fundamentals of catalysis and energetic materials. Research areas of particular interest include theoretical and computational modeling of natural and man-made ionospheric perturbations, including self-consistent development and evolution, chemistry and transport effects, and impacts on and interactions with the background ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics; development of coherent radar systems for ionospheric sensing and measurement in the HF - VHF range, including near-vertical incidence, near- horizontal incidence, and long-range systems, as well as identification and interpretation of various echo types/sources and propagation paths/effects; high-resolution array-based HF imaging of ionospheric structure to include advanced imaging techniques, long baselines, and active or passive operations; development of ionospheric modification technologies and delivery systems to include non-traditional platforms, new materials, and advanced techniques; compact modular low-power HF ionospheric sounding systems including arbitrary waveform capability, automated synchronization to allow oblique reception, automated trace recognition, scaling of vertical-incidence and oblique modes, and advanced portable antennas; and theoretical and numerical modeling of kinetic and plasma processes affecting energy interchange in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, including plasmaspheric boundary layer phenomena such as diffuse electron and proton aurora, Sub-Auroral Ion Drifts (SAIDs), Sub-Auroral Polarization Streams (SAPS), Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arcs, the Sub-Auroral density trough, ion outflows, and artificial ionosphere perturbations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>d) Anticipated Deliverable Items.</strong> The following items are anticipated to be delivered by each CALL as tailored for the need. Hardware, software, or data will be identified in a particular CALL. The following data deliverables are representative of the types of data that may be required: (a) a Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) a Final Report, in both draft and final form; (d) Presentation Materials; and (e) Patent Reports.
