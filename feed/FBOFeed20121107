<DESC>The NATO Support Agency (NSPA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to repair and strengthen 13 bridges in the Republic of Macedonia.
<p>NATO has decided to improve the conditions of road network in the Republic of Macedonia, divided in three phases. Phases 1 and 2 have been concluded.&nbsp;NSPA will issue an&nbsp;IFB for the third and final phase of the Project to repair and strengthen 13 bridges to Military Load Class 70(T)/100(W) on KFOR Main Supply Route Bottle, between Veles and Katlanovo.</p>
<p>All bridges are in need of restoration due to damage caused by failure of the drainage systems. In addition, these 13 bridges were not designed for the NATO required military load classes, and therefore require strengthening, mainly of the deck slab. The work consists of repair of the structure, the drainage system, the deck slabs, pavements and new protection barriers (New Jersey type). Bidders will be provided with a 90% design for the construction works, which are planned to start in early 2013 and be finalized by early 2014.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded for the complete works as described above.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that use of local sub-contractors will be permitted for this project.</p>
<p>In order to bid on this project, a U.S. primary contractor must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce will be using IFB-2011-5VA30180-0 as its reference for the IFB.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a U.S. firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. The Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms must request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 14 November 2012</p>
<p>Planned tender release: not earlier than 21 November 2012</p>
<p>Scheduled bid closing: second week of January 2013</p>
<p>Anticipated contract award: January 2013</p>

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) long-term contract with QIAGEN Corporation for their HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables to support their Hybrid Capture 2 (Hc2) and Rapid Capture System (RCS), through the use of DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  Currently, QIAGEN Corporations testing systems reside at many of the MTFs on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  QIAGENs HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables provide the only FDA approved option for the MTFs to perform HPV testing.  QIAGENs test kits are specifically configured to support QIAGENs testing systems employed at many of the MTFs.  No other manufacturer or distributor sells or has access to these products manufactured by QIAGEN.  Only QIAGEN has the capability of providing the required items. 
 
During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using QIAGEN Corporations Chlamydia (CT) and Gonorrhea (GC) test kits which operate under the same testing systems as the HPV test kits and will be procured under this solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  QIAGEN will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog for each system-Hc2 and RCS and an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog for each system on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP ECAT system.  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Acknowledgment and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgments, send 855-Order Acknowledgments and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are two communication strategies available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and the American Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI standard for direct EDI.  QIAGEN Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.  

The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $4.9 million.  Solicitation SPM2DE08R0052 is expected to become available June 25th, 2008 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board website at www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil .

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to provide the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) plans to procure services for Development and Maintenance of an Aged Non-Human Primate Tissue Bank.
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete requirements currently <br />being performed under NIA Contract No. HHSN260200800026C. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures using NAICS Code 541990. It is anticipated that a single cost plus fixed fee type contract will be awarded for a 1-year period of performance beginning on or about August 1, 2013, with 4 option years. It is expected that a solicitation will be issued on or about 10/30/2012 and proposal due date is expected 12/14/2012. The objective of the Aged Non-human Primate Tissue Bank contract is to acquire, archive and distribute excess tissue from NHP that are being euthanized for research purposes at institutions around the country.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Aged Non-human Primate Tissue Bank is to provide a mechanism to archive and distribute excess tissue from non-human primates (NHP) that are being euthanized for research purposes. This will provide a new research resource to many investigators and contribute to a reduction in the number of NHP needed by the research community since multiple investigators will be able to take advantage of each animal. The tissue will allow investigators to test hypotheses in a model closely related to humans by providing access to NHP tissue without the expense of obtaining and housing the animals. This is an extremely important aspect of this project, as the supply of NHP in general, and rhesus macaques in particular, is very limited. The tissues will be collected under strictly controlled protocols to ensure the integrity of the tissue. Tissue will be flash-frozen without fixation or fixed and embedded, to fit the needs of a wide-range of molecular and histochemical techniques.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall receive NHP tissue from a variety of institutions around the country, solicit tissue from sources identified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), solicit tissue from sources identified by their own interactions with the research community upon approval of the source by the COR, coordinate the transfer of the tissue to the Contractor's facility, process and aliquot the tissue for preservation as needed, preserve the tissue and embed as needed, package, label and store the tissue, prepare a detailed inventory of the tissue, and ship tissue to investigators at the direction of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: (1) Inventory up-date report - This report shall be provided to NIA after each shipment or addition of tissue, or weekly at most. (2) Semi-Annual Progress report - This report shall be provided within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of the period covered by the report. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semi-annual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due. Progress reports shall detail the species, gender, and ages of animals from which tissue was received for banking, the number of samples of each tissue type received from each animal, the number of orders filled listed by institution, and the number of each tissue type delivered. (3) Final report - A final report shall be submitted on or before the expiration date of contract. The final report shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including number of tissue collected and number of tissues shipped to investigators.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. All updates/amendments pertaining to this requirement will only be posted and made available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (Fedbizopps) site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offerors responsibility to review this site frequently for updates to any and all documents.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-12-170 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-12-170.</p>

Senior leadership includes but is not limited to the president, vice-president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
  Key personnel are individuals who will have major contractor or project management responsibilities and/or will provide specific expertise.  Individuals identified as key personnel will be dedicated staff, i.e., their primary responsibility being the support of this contract.  In addition to senior leadership, key personnel that are expected to have direct control of project execution for this contract should be listed including (2) two project managers, (1) one GIS specialist,  (1) one licensed photogrammatrist,  and (1) one quality control specialist.  Failure to provide qualified key personnel in each of these positions described above will be evaluated less favorably.  The professional qualifications and past performance of the prime or lead contractors key personnel will be evaluated more favorably than those of a subcontractor(s)s key personnel.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: SF330, Part 1, Section E.
  Provide the following: (a) list of names of each proposed key personnel to be assigned to this contract.  Identify and describe their professional registration or qualifications, role expected to play in this contract, and roles they performed in similar projects similar to those listed in Selection Criterion 1; and (b) resumes for key personnel are limited to two (2) pages each and shall include project specific info that clearly set forth the role and experience the individual had in performing the contract.  Any pages over this limit will not be considered.  A maximum of eight (8) resumes will be considered.  Should the A-E firm submit more resumes than required, only the first eight (8) resumes will be considered.
  In a consolidated organization chart, identify each of the personnel in the firms hierarchy designating the link between prime and subcontractor personnel as required.

(3) Past Performance:   A-E firms will be evaluated on the geospatial projects documented in selection criterion (1) above with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules shall be provided.  Past performance information not related to the projects described to meet selection criterion (1) will not be considered.  The A-E shall provide ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project.  If no hard copy documentation can be provided, the A-E shall provide name and contact information for the customer project manager or representative at that agency most closely connected to the project in order to obtain customer feedback.
  In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider information in the A-Es SF-330 and information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.  The info provided by the A-E may provide the major portion of the information used in the Government's evaluation for past performance.  The Government, however, is not restricted to the information provided by the Offeror and may use other sources to assess  past performance info such as the Past Performance Info Retrieval System (PPIRS), 
A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and inquiries with previous customers/owners. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: SF330, Part 1, Section H.
  If an A-E is utilizing past performance information of affiliates/subsidiaries/parent /LLC/LTD member companies, the proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the contract in order for the past performance info of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies to be considered.  The proposal shall state specific commitments of technical resources (e.g. personnel, equipment) that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will commit to the performance of this contract.  In particular, the proposal will clearly state the specific commitments of resources of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member that will perform the contract requirements.
  The SF-330 shall also describe specific roles of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies in terms of the work it will either self-perform or manage on behalf of the A-E for future task orders in performance of the contract. 
(c) A subcontractor's or subconsultant's past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the joint venture partner because there is no direct legal relationship between the Government and the subcontractor/subconsultant.  The Government will consider the past performance and experience of a subcontractor/subconsultant where the prime contractor provides, in its SF-330, evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the prime contractor and the subcontractor/subconsultant to enter into a subcontract.
 However, the level of consideration will depend on the extent to which the proposal demonstrates the prime contractor's commitment to award a subcontract to the subcontractor/subconsultant and subcontractor's/subconsultant's commitment to enter into a subcontract with the prime contractor, including legal accountability for both parties. (d) Prime contractor-subcontractor/subconsultant teams/Joint Ventures/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working  successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

(4) Quality Control Program:  A-E firms will be evaluated on the demonstrated success of the Quality Control (QC) program used to ensure technical accuracy and coordination of all deliverables, plans and documents.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: SF330, Part 1, Section H (this criterion shall be addressed by prime only in lieu of by individual subconsultants).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, FL (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to a Small Disabled Veteran Owned Disadvantaged Small Business (SDVOSB) Nexus Technology Solutions LLC of Panama City, FL for software support in Information Assurance (IA), software development, software maintenance, Software Configuration Management (SCM) and software installation support for the SEAVIEW project. The order will have a period of performance of six months with an option for an additional six months of software support. This requirement is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.
 This is a follow-on to efforts previously conducted by Nexus Technology Solutions under order GS00Q09BGD0013 (Task Order 4QCA57108194).  Nexus Technology Solutions LLC has in-depth knowledge of this complex system, the technologies used, and the software development and configuration management tools that are used by the project.   Due to the tight time constraints on delivery of the required products and services, it is neither feasible nor cost effective to utilize another provider for these services.  It is estimated that it would take another contractor approximately 960 man hours to achieve the level of knowledge of the system currently held by Nexus Technologies.  To fully understand the system, another contractor would have to, at a minimum, witness a system installation and perform a functional test, requiring two trips off site, incurring travel costs in addition to the additional labor.
  It is estimated that, at a minimum, this would cost the Government additional money and cause a 6 month delay in performance of this mission essential tasking. Nexus Technology Solutions LLC is the only company that can provide the support required in a timely and cost effective manner. NAICS code is 541511. Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M. PSC code is K070.

The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as
the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor.

(2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

<DESC>**BACKGROUND**<br /><br />The United States Air Force (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Furnishings Commodity Council (FCC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for procuring carpet and carpet accessories. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise wide, Continental United States (CONUS), solution for carpet and carpet accessories. The Government intends to issue this solicitation under NAICS 314110, Carpet and Rug Mills. <br /><br />ESG was founded on the premise that if the Government limits the pool of authorized vendors to just a few, that increased volume among fewer vendors will garner increased product discounts, and foster strategic partnerships between Government and Industry. With that said, the Government intent is to limit the vendor base to no more than 4 manufacturers.<br /><br /><br />**INSTRUCTIONS**<br /><br />Please review the attachments.&nbsp; The RFI&nbsp;Body Document&nbsp;(file name FA8057_13_RFI_Flooring_Nov2012) provides background, instructions, and other information on how to respond to this RFI.

The resultant medical care provided will be expected to be seamless in that a beneficiary cannot differentiate between the quality of care and services provided at a VA operated CBOC and the Contractor operated CBOC.  The purpose of this special notice is to announce VA's requirement to potential Contractors so that they are aware of and begin to prepare for the forthcoming issuance of the solicitation.

<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high precision vacuum weighing system.</p>
<p>The measurement of mass in a vacuum environment is critical for support of the experiments involved in the redefinition of the unit of mass, the kilogram. The watt balance experiment (performed at NIST) and the International Avogadro Coordination project will, for the first time in history, define the unit of mass in terms of the Planck constant, an invariant of nature. However, both experiments will take place in a vacuum environment. In order to disseminate the kilogram to the outside world, the physical effects, i.e., the gain and loss of mass due to moving a mass artifact in and out of a vacuum environment must be quantified. The requested system is required in support of a broader NIST program in the Quantum Measurement Division that will a) measure mass in terms of the Planck constant (watt balance); b) develop models for an artifact's change in mass when going in and out of a vacuum environment (mass in vacuum system being requested); c) dissemination of the Planck constant-based kilogram from vacuum to air via a magnetic levitation mass comparison system (currently under development). A critical part of this program is the procurement of a self-contained, high precision mass-in-vacuum system for quantifying the effects of atmospheric contaminants on metallic mass standards.</p>
<p>The system shall be capable of:</p>
<p>I. Minimum Specifications<br />A. The Mass-in-Vacuum System must have the capability of determining the mass of weights in vacuum, air, or inert gas (e.g. argon) from 1 mg to 1 kg, using the comparison method.<br />B. The mass balance shall have a resolution of 100 ng or smaller.<br />C. The mass balance shall have a repeatability of 500 ng or smaller.<br />D. The Mass-in-Vacuum System shall have the capability of loading and handling a minimum of six weights for mass measurement<br />E.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Further, VA is not at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  It is the responsibility of the responders to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  Responders are advised that VA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  

For project planning and information gathering, a brief description of the effort is included which defines the description of the requirement needed to support our mission. Information obtained from this RFI will be used within VA and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. Although VA has identified questions of particular relevance, we welcome comments or suggestions on any part of this document.


Background
VA operates the nation's largest integrated health care network, operating over 150 hospitals, over 130 community living centers and over 900 outpatient clinics.  There are over 8.5 Million Veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system, with over 5.5 million Veterans using the health care system in any given year. 
As part of its commitment to ensuring that Veterans have adequate access to VA health care facilities, VA provides mileage reimbursement to eligible Veterans to offset costs associated with travel to hospitals. 
In FY 2010, VA provided mileage reimbursement to 1 million eligible beneficiaries. As part of its commitment to Veterans and to the American public to serve as good stewards of public resources, VA seeks to make improvements to the Beneficiary Travel program under the VetTraveler solution.  The purpose of this document is to capture and articulate the Business Requirements of the VetTraveler solution.
Description
VA plans to acquire a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution to manage travel and expense reimbursement services. The solution, VetTraveler, will provide features and capabilities that leverage automation and multiple user interface capabilities to manage and process Beneficiary Travel claims.  The scope of this effort is also to support the VetTraveler solution, which includes system operations and sustainment and software development that includes requirements analysis, definition, and management; package design, development, test, product delivery and documentation.  The VetTraveler solution will need to provide many of the features and capabilities typically found in third-party expense management services and solutions.  These features and capabilities include, but are not limited to:
A.	Ability to create a user profile with contact and financial information (used for Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) payment) 
B.	Ability to integrate with external legacy systems to access relevant information (e.g. address and appointment)
1.	Legacy Systems may consist of the following:
i.	VHA's Enrollment System
ii.	Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Beneficiary Travel Package
iii.	 EFT system
iv.	 VistA Appointment Package
C.	Ability to create expense entries 
D.	Ability to upload scanned images of receipts and supporting documentation and link these to the expense entries
E.	Ability to plan for future Beneficiary Travel
F.	Ability to submit expenses for either manual or automatic review for approval
G.	Ability to receive the payment in the form of an EFT transaction
H.	Support for Multiple User Interfaces and Modes
1.	The VetTraveler solution shall be accessible via the following user interfaces:
i.	A standard desktop web browser (e.g. PC Desktop, laptop, etc.).  This is to ensure quick deployment of the solution and immediate use.  
ii.	A user Interface optimized for mobile devices (e.g. mobile browser)
iii.	A user Interface optimized for use on Kiosk devices
The main difference between the VetTraveler solution and the typical third-party expense management services and solutions is the need to evaluate claims based on the VA Beneficiary Travel rules and guidelines and using Medical Appointment and Eligibility information found in external systems. 

Appointments are managed through a VistA module called PCE (Patient Care Encounter). VA currently runs a majority of VistA systems on the proprietary InterSystems Cach version of MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System).

Business Requirements

In accordance with Title 38 United States Code (U.S.C) Section 111 and Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 70, the VetTraveler solution will: 
"	allow a Beneficiary Travel Claimant to submit a expense and travel reimbursement
"	contain all of the rules necessary to determine eligibility and calculate the claim payment
"	support the ability to process claims manually and automatically
"	integrate with external systems to access relevant information (e.g. address and appointment)
"	submit payment requests to the Fiscal Department  
The scope of the project is to implement a solution that replaces the existing Beneficiary Travel functions performed by the current process and systems while adding the following key features and capabilities:
"	Support for Electronic Funds Transfer payments
A central Business need is to eliminate Beneficiary Travel cash reimbursement payments and to alleviate the lines at the facilities.  The VetTraveler solution will be a key to moving to this new cashless model.
VetTraveler will need to interact with at least two financial systems called Financial Management System (FMS) and Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) to enable EFT's. Finance related data are stored centrally at FMS. FMS is a mainframe based application that provides batch oriented processing for transactional updates and report generation.  IFCAP is a VistA application that automates a number of financial and logistics activities. IFCAP maintains an interface to/from FMS. Each VistA application to IFCAP interface may be different from site to site since each site has tailored the IFCAP application to the needs of the site.  However, the IFCAP messages to FMS from each site are standardized across the enterprise. 
Patient-oriented data including identity, demographics, ADT, eligibility and enrollment are stored at legacy VistA deployed throughout the VA as well as centrally managed through Eligibility Service System.

"	Support for Veteran and Non-Veteran Beneficiary Travel Claimants
The VetTraveler solution will support the creation of Beneficiary Travel profiles for both Veterans and Non-Veteran Beneficiary Travel Claimants to ensure efficient processing and payment
"	Support for Multiple User Interfaces and Modes
The VetTraveler solution will be accessible via the following user interfaces:
"	A standard desktop web browser (e.g. PC Desktop, laptop, etc.).  This is to ensure quick deployment of the solution and immediate use.  In the context of this project the Veteran desktop configuration is undetermined and will vary greatly. Vendor should provide minimum requirements for which they would support their solution. VA desktops are Microsoft XP SP3 / Internet Explorer 7 based. VA is moving to Windows 7 and IE8 in the near future. VA follows the Federal Desktop Core Configuration and does not allow modification of end user systems. Contractor needs to ensure VetTraveler works correctly on VA desktop systems as configured. The Contractor will need to ensure that the VetTraveler is accessible from the default desktop configuration from testing as well as deployment perspective.
"	A user Interface optimized for mobile devices (e.g. mobile browser) that is compatible with Android, Windows, and MAC Operating Systems. VetTraveler is to be a web based application - VA desires a version that is optimized for a mobile device and accessible via that devices browser.
"	A user Interface optimized for use on Kiosk devices. The Contractor will be responsible for exposing and integrating the VetTraveler to Kiosk middleware preferably using Web Services.
"	Support for Submission of Receipts and Non-Receipt Expenses
The VetTraveler solution will support the ability to submit expenses that require a receipt (e.g. Air Travel) and expenses that do not require are receipt (e.g. Mileage expense).
"	Support for Submission of "Expense Report" 
The VetTraveler solution will support the ability to submit an "expense report" composed of expense entries with scanned images of the supporting documentation.  The supporting documentation is used to document expenses for Meals/Lodging, Other Expenses (e.g. Tolls), other Transportation modes (e.g. Air Travel), and Special Mode.  
"	Ability to plan for future Beneficiary Travel
The VetTraveler solution will need to provide the Beneficiary Travel Claimant the ability to plan for future trips.  This would entail allowing the Beneficiary Travel Claimant to submit information for a particular future appointment and receive information from the VetTraveler solution on how the claim may be adjudicated (e.g. the eligibility of the trip for Beneficiary Travel reimbursement, and if eligible the estimated reimbursement amount). 
In addition, the VetTraveler solution will allow the Beneficiary Travel Claimant to create a claim for a future appointment and submit it for payment.  However, the VetTraveler solution will not process or calculate the payment until the appointment has been completed.  The purpose of this feature is to reduce the numbers of steps between planning their travel and submitting a claim.   
"	Business Intelligence and Reporting
The VetTraveler solution will need to include the ability to produce a range of reports to ensure that the solution is effective and meets the goals and objectives of the Business Owners.
The following model is depicting a High-Level view of the Future State of the VetTraveler solution for the Beneficiary Travel process.

Under the previous contract, 44-GHz transmit sub-arrays were developed in Phase I, transmit and receive functionality was added in Phase II, and a fully functional Q-band transmit array compatible with system implementation through sub-system integration into specific apertures was developed under Phase IIIA. Teledyne has demonstrated a millimeter wave tiled array concept that integrates the required functionality through the invention of an integration process to incorporate silicon digital beam-forming electronics and compound semiconductor Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs), including Indium Phosphide power amplifiers. These elements were combined into planar antenna technology through the development of a three-dimensional silicon interposer to fabricate small form-factor, wide-scan apertures. The development of the silicon interposer and associated advanced fabrication process flows for the integration of disparate integrated circuits is the fundamental basis of the Teledyne known-good-die packaging approach. The die &ndash; including digital integrated circuits, MMICs and other required active and passive components &ndash; are tested and known to be fully operational before insertion into the interposer. Owing to the advanced maturity of silicon micro-machining, this approach allows for the interposer to perform as a highly compact package that reliably interconnects the constituent components. The known-good-die implementation developed under SMART involves processes and expertise that are unique to Teledyne and is viewed by the Government as the most viable approach to date for future batch fabrication suitable for large-scale transitions of the technology. Phase III is focused on the successful transition of SMART technology to batch fabrication for an identified DoD application requiring mm-wave functionality and interface-specific requirements and has resulted in unique circuit designs that have been demonstrated and tested to these specifications. Under Phase IIIB, Teledyne will work to create high-yield SMART components at advanced technology readiness levels in full compatibility with system requirements resulting in batch processing capability and supplier of key components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS.
<p>THE BASE TASKS OF THIS CONTRACT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce (US DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) conducts basic and applied research in information technology, system and network sciences, mathematical and statistical analyses and modeling and simulation for measurement science. Within ITL, the Information Access Division (IAD) advances and promotes the use of technologies for the intuitive, efficient, and effective access, manipulation, analysis, and exchange of complex information through collaboration with industry, academia, and other government agencies to research and develop measurement and evaluation methods and standards, including performance metrics, evaluation methodologies, test suites and test data, prototypes and test beds. IAD promotes research and development, conducts evaluations, and provides guidelines for interoperability in various areas in Information Technology covering health information technology (HIT), biometrics, multimedia search and retrieval, text search and retrieval, usability and human factors, and digital media preservation.</p>
<p>IAD conducts research and standards efforts in several areas in health IT. Specifically, IAD leads an effort on electronic health record (EHR) preservation and standards for EHR data interoperability, and a medical device interoperability standards effort. IAD is leading an effort for Electronic Health Record Management and Preservation (EHR-MP) where one aim is to design a standardized universally usable system workflow in order to parse diverse incoming EHRs and store them into an archtype-based digital repository. An objective of EHR-MP is to establish a standardized interoperable infrastructure framework for EHR data preservation and interoperability by:<br /><br />(1) Creating a standard EHR Mapper Markup Language to encapsulate clinical information by parsing various incoming EHR formats and storing them into archtype classes; and</p>
<p>(2) Providing a set of standard interfaces for systems to access, migrate, replicate, and distribute archtype-based clinical information between different digital repositories.</p>
<p>Another Health IT effort within IAD is the design, development and validation framework for medical device interoperability. This Health IT medical device operability project will potentially enable the data acquisition and interoperability of a variety of sensors including multimodal data collection and medical devices used in critical healthcare applications in operating rooms, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and other medical applications. Doctors and medical practitioners use numerous independent medical devices like vital sign sensors, surgical video cameras, actuators, and infusion pumps, usually operating in standalone mode. A simple surgical procedure might require thirty such devices, and a complex procedure up to three hundred. The devices sometimes interact pathologically, causing false alarms. One goal of the effort is to potentially identify gaps in current standards and enable provisions for providing guidelines to mitigate such gaps.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for the Division to maintain and upgrade/improve the necessary metrics and infrastructures for standards in Health IT EHR data preservation and for medical device interoperability standards. This acquisition addresses the needs of the Information Access Division to maintain, improve and implement testing and development methodologies for these programs in Health IT standards development efforts.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall provide the necessary expertise and services required for software design and development for maintenance and upgrade of the existing infrastructure, and enhancement of the existing applications for Health IT for standards development in EHR-MP and medical device interoperability. The required system will fill that gap in test capability.</p>
<p>This acquisition was procured on a sole source basis and is authorized by statute under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-5, awards under the 8(a) Program (15 U.S.C. 637).</p>
<p>Contract Number SB1341-12-CN-0097 was awarded to NetVision Resources, Inc. of Chantilly, VA, on September 21, 2012, in the amount of $1,096,838.40, including the base and all option line items. The period of performance is September 21, 2012 through September 20, 2013.</p>
<p>Modification 001 will be executed to incorporate a payment schedule. The total firm fixed price of the task order and the period of performance shall remain unchanged.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>PEO LCS Technology Day will be held on 30 November 2012 at Building 40 within Naval Surface Warfare Center (NWSC) Carderock in West Bethesda, MD.  The event will begin at 0800 and is estimated to end at 1600 EST. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  The event will be held at the Distribution D level and is open to DOD government and DoD contracted US industry representatives only.
Technology Day will formally launch the PEO LCS Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) process as described in the approved PEO LCS Science & Technology (S&T) Investment Strategy. This event is planned to be held on an annual basis.  Technology candidates for the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) that will support the RTI process should be considered mature technologies at the start of the process to facilitate rapid insertion.

There is an overall interest at PEO LCS in advanced software and hardware technology improvements that could help the LCS successfully complete its primary missions of countering diesel submarine threats, littoral mine threats, and surface threats, such as small surface craft attacks.
  The technology focus areas for PEO LCS will be announced at Technology Day.  Although the scope of the topics under these focus areas  this year may be limited, the broader intent of Technology Day is to facilitate communication of LCS technology needs and potential provider solutions to better guide Rapid Technology Insertion efforts in the future.

In this initial year of the process, the funding allocated to this BAA will be small.  Funding will be expanded appropriately in future years.

PEO LCS requests that firms interested in attending the PEO LCS Technology Day submit company names and attendee lists by 1400 EST, 26 November 2012 via e-mail to Donald Park at dopark@caci.com.  Companies are limited to two representatives each as seating is limited.
  All attendees are required to present government-issued photo identification upon entry to the event. 

This announcement is for informational planning purposes, does not constitute a formal solicitation or request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Attendance at the Technology Day and any discussion/release of information is strictly voluntary.  Any formal solicitation will be announced at a later date.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time during the acquisition process.  The Government will not be responsible for any associated costs as a result of prospective offerors interest and/or response to this notice or future solicitation.

<CONTACT>Nancy L. Hilleary, Phone 7034286120, Email Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source fixed price contract to the Council Oak to support the National Committee on Levee Safety. Enacted on July 6, 2012, Section 100226 of the Moving Ahead for Program in the 21st Century (MAP21) Act requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in cooperation with the National Committee on Levee Safety (NCLS) to establish a "Flood Protection Structure Accreditation Task Force" to develop a process to: (1) Better align the information and data collected by the USACE Inspection of Completed Works (ICW) inspections so the data collected is sufficient to satisfy 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 65.10; (2) Align information so information collected for either ICW or accreditation purposes can be used interchangeably.
<p>Considerations of the Task Force include gathering recommendations from all interested persons in each region and revisions to both the ICW program and 44CFR65.10. Products of the Task Force include an interim report is due 180 days after enactment (January 2, 2013) and a final report due 1 year after enactment (July 6, 2013). The Task Force will terminate after submission of this final report. Reports are to be submitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Committee on Environment and Public Works; Committee on Financial Services; Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure; and Committee on Natural Resources.</p>
<p>This Task Force expands the work and recommendations that the NCLS previously accomplished under Section 9003, titled Committee on Levee Safety, of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007. More specifically, the Task Force will be looking at the related NCLS recommendations involving revisions to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) process for levee accreditation (also referred to as levee certification) and better alignment of federal programs.</p>
<p>Objective of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Provide meeting planning, facilitation, and note taking services to ensure productive and useful meetings, which successfully engage Task Force members and other attendees to accomplish meeting objectives. In addition provide technical writing services to capture work completed by the Task Force in the format of a quality document presenting the final recommendations.</p>
<p>The Council Oak (a Woman Owned Small Business) has been under contract to the National Committee on Levee Safety, as a sub-contractor, since 2008. In that capacity, the contractor has established working relationships with partner organizations, including the USACE, FEMA, State and Local agencies, as well as non-profit organizations with substantial interest in levee safety. In that capacity, the contractor has gained a level of trust among the participants, the significance of which cannot be overestimated. Furthermore, the contractor has gained extensive technical knowledge on the topic as well as specific knowledge of the interests of the parties involved. The contractor, as part of the previous work, prepared a Report to Congress with recommendations for a national levee safety program.</p>
<p>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2); "when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source".&nbsp; <br /><br />However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting officer within fifteen (15) days of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price type contract to the Council Oak for support of the Flood Protection Structure Accreditation Task Force.</p>

WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred"E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com.

<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br /><br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, </span></span></p>

The government reserves the right to remove item from the schedule of Items or do a common item comparison if offerors do not submit pricing for all items. In addition, the Government will evaluate different sized offers based on price per pound.</p>

<DESC>As part of the due diligence, The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) conducts cost-benefit analysis to assess proposed projects' likely economic impact and cost-effectiveness and estimate the share of the population who may benefit from the program. Thus, MCC is seeking a results reporting analyst to support the results reporting function of the division by carrying out basic data analysis, database management, data entry, report layout and production, and web site support.
<p>This position is located in the Department of Policy and Evaluation (DPE). The incumbent serves as Results Reporting Analyst within the Monitoring and Evaluation Division (M&amp;E) of DPE. The analyst will report to the Managing Director of M&amp;E. After a Compact is entered into with an eligible country, focusing on results during implementation, the division is responsible for, among other things, monitoring the economic impact of Compact interventions on household income and poverty reduction within the country.</p>
<p>The contract will be for a Personal Services Contractor (PSC). A personal services contract is different from the usual non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by FAR 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (FAR 7.502). By law and by the terms of their personal services contract, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />(ii) price <br />Basis for award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive that reflects a complete understanding of the Salient Characteristics and represents the best value to the Government based on selection of the technically acceptable quotation with the lowest evaluated price. The best value is represented by the lowest priced technically acceptable quotation. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The technical area will be evaluated on an -acceptable&#8214; or -unacceptable&#8214; basis. Only those quotations determined to be technically acceptable will be evaluated on price. If the quotation received is determined to be unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award. <br />(c) A purchase order, mailed or otherwise furnished to the vendor shall result in a binding contract upon receipt of written acknowledgement by the vendor or commencement of performance.<br />NOTE: In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided: <br />Legal Effect of Quotations <br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract.

<DESC><p align="left">The US Army Corps of Engineers is hosting a conference/meeting for members of Corps water resources engineering staff and counterparts from the River and Disaster Management Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan over three days in and around Portland, Oregon during the last week of November 2012. <br /><br />The meeting will begin with a formal conference-style day in a meeting room in central Portland (site selection is still in progress, but the conference will likely be in a hotel conference room or a similar space) on the 28th of November. The bulk of the conference will consist of a series of presentations to an audience of 30-40 participants, with Power Point slides. There will be four water-related topics with one presenter from USACE and one from MLIT on each topic. USACE presenters will speak in English, and&nbsp;MLIT presenters will probably speak in Japanese, although some may speak in English. The conference will require simultaneous translation for the technical topics, question-and-answer session on the presentations, and opening and closing formalities.<br /><br />See attached Solicitation document for further details, instructions and conditions.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.

    (2) __ Outside the United States.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the pricing spreadsheet and to extend the closing date to Nov 13th.<br /><br />The pricing spreadsheet has some revised/updated part numbers, highlighted in green for identification.&nbsp; The items highlighted in blue are new line items that require pricing.&nbsp; They are added to the spreadsheet to provide the USCG additional flexibility when ordering off of the resulting IDIQ contract.&nbsp; This is because occasionally, especially early in the contract performance, a part will be required that is a&nbsp;remanufactured part, and the USCG requires that part new, or there will be a part requiring a core turn in, but the USCG doesn't have a core to turn in.

<DESC>This is a small business set-aside procurement for RCRA Facility Investigations. The purpose of the RFI is to obtain information to fully characterize the nature, extent and rate of migration of releases of hazardous waste or constituents and to interpret this information to determine whether interim corrective measures and/or a Corrective Measures Study may be necessary. Prior to conducting the investigation, the owner or operator (Anniston Army Depot) will in most cases be directed, through a permit or enforcement order, to submit a written plan (the RFI Work Plan) that should propose, in detail, the manner in which the investigation will be conducted. Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) would receive notice from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) that a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) is required. The RFI field work shall be completed within 180 days of ADEM notification to ANAD unless other actions have been approved by ADEM. A work plan will be developed for the project including a site-specific health and safety plan, as well as a quality assurance project plan. The work plan will be submitted to the Contracting officer within 30 days after the award of the task order. Work will not commence until the approval has been given. North American Industry Classification System Code is 562910; size standard is 500 employees. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hardcopies will not be provided. Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the Internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (ASFI). Estimated issue date is 6 September 2012. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above Internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) long-term contract with QIAGEN Corporation for their HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables to support their Hybrid Capture 2 (Hc2) and Rapid Capture System (RCS), through the use of DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  Currently, QIAGEN Corporations testing systems reside at many of the MTFs on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  QIAGENs HPV High Risk DNA test kits, related supplies and consumables provide the only FDA approved option for the MTFs to perform HPV testing.  QIAGENs test kits are specifically configured to support QIAGENs testing systems employed at many of the MTFs.  No other manufacturer or distributor sells or has access to these products manufactured by QIAGEN.  Only QIAGEN has the capability of providing the required items. 
 
During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using QIAGEN Corporations Chlamydia (CT) and Gonorrhea (GC) test kits which operate under the same testing systems as the HPV test kits and will be procured under this solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  QIAGEN will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog for each system-Hc2 and RCS and an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog for each system on a Cost-Per-Test basis.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP ECAT system.  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Acknowledgment and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgments, send 855-Order Acknowledgments and transmit 810-Invoices for payment.  There are two communication strategies available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and the American Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI standard for direct EDI.  QIAGEN Corporation must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.  

The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $4.9 million.  Solicitation SPM2DE08R0052 is expected to become available July 8, 2008 and can be found on the DLA Internet Bid Board website at www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil .

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to post a competitive solicitation for the Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA). The CSEA will be responsible for ACB 16 development, integration and testing; TI 16 integration and testing; ACB Next development, integration and testing; and in-service support.  NAVSEA intends to award one Cost type contract via full and open competition. The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed. Interested offerors should monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation. Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidder's mailing list.
 

At this time a draft solicitation is attached for industry questions and comments. The government will be accepting questions through 5 PM EST 30 November 2012. All questions should be electronically submitted to Janel Duval (janel.duval@navy.mil) and Steven Santos (steven.o.santos@navy.mil). Only questions transmitted electronically will receive a response. It is the Governments intention that questions and responses will be distributed electronically to all Offerors.  Information provided with each question should include the document name, document date, specific page, paragraph, clause or other definitive citation requiring clarification. Questions will be answered and incorporated in to the final Request for Proposal at the discretion of the Navy.
 Questions received after the date set forth above may not be answered prior to the release of the final RFP.  Offerors are hereby notified that from time to time, the Government may post additional information to the web site relating to this solicitation (e.g. responses to questions). It is the Offerors responsibility to check the web site for any such information.
IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary and each company shall be certified CMMI Level 5. However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S.
 Department of State. 

Two sites have been established to provide Bidder access to CSEA RFP GFI and Sample Problems; one site for Confidential and SECRET Level, and the other for Unclassified.  Access to these sites requires verification that the bidder has personnel and site authorized for access and storage of Secret level GFI (holds an active DD 254) prior to gaining access and requires verification that the bidder holds CMMI Level 5 prior.  A request for access to the site along with the DD254 and CMMI Level 5 documentation shall be sent to Janel Duval at janel.duval@navy.mil.  There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation. All potential offerors seeking access to the classified attachments must submit a transmittal letter with their request for access that contains the following signed certification:

I, [insert signatory's name, title, company], hereby certify that [company] will destroy any and all copies, notes, or other materials produced using the classified or other restricted information provided in connection with draft solicitation N00024-13-R-5103 within 180 days from receipt of access to the information, unless [company] submits a proposal in response to a final solicitation N00024-13-R-5103 issued by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
 

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.
 If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. This is not an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The United States Government seeks to lease office and related support space consisting of approximately 10,900 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space and 1.6 acres of wareyard space in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space should yield a minimum of 10,900 ANSI/BOMA square feet (minimum 900 ABOA office and 10,000 warehouse). The office, warehouse and wareyard space shall be contiguous (the office must be inside the office/warehouse building and the wareyard must be immediately contiguous to the office/warehouse building). <br /><br />The warehouse space offered must have a minimum ceiling clear height of 16'. The space offered must be modifiable to install windows in the exterior walls to provide natural light for the office area and to install roll up doors with a minimum dimension of 14'H x 12"W. The wareyard area must be securable via a fence and adequate lighting. An up-to-date Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment will be required. <br /><br />The proposed space must be located within the following delineated area and must have the following characteristics: <br /><strong><br />North</strong>: Sahara Avenue;<br /><strong>South</strong>: South Hollywood Boulevard, Pabco Road, Warm Springs Road;<br /><strong>East</strong>: Blue Diamond (Rainbow to I15), St Rose Parkway (I15 to 215), 215/564 (564 to Warm Springs Road);<br /><strong>West</strong>: South Rainbow Boulevard.<br /><br />The space should be located in areas similar in nature to an industrial area which is open and has a low population density. Because the agency uses very large vehicles to perform their mission, the space cannot be located in high traffic areas to ensure agency vehicles have adequate turning radius' (are able to exit onto streets and roads in a timely manner without waiting long periods for other vehicles to clear) and are not creating traffic disturbances (blocking traffic). Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet the Governments requirements for Fire, Life-safety, and Handicapped Accessibility. <br /><br />Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. <br /><br />The term of the proposed lease is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. Occupancy is required on or before <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 31, 2013</span></strong>. <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):
<p>&bull; Building name/address<br />&bull; Legal property description, recent survey, and property identification numbers (PIN).<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date it will be available.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered and Site Plan..<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined office area/useable square feet (USF).<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot, specifying services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; In cases where an agent is representing multiple ownership entities, written acknowledgement, and permission to represent multiple owners for the same submission</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:<br />GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative CBRE, Inc.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit pertinent information to the tenant broker and the GSA Contracting Officer:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS THE NOTICE RELATED TO SOURCES SOUGHT HSCG50-12-R-EVRAES.<br /><br />ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE Request for Proposal (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.
<p>1. Small Business.</p>
<p>This proposed contract is a partial small business reserve in accordance with FAR 19.502-4(a) as one or more contracts will be reserved for this multiple-award procurement. The appropriate NAICS for this contract is 541330. The small business size standard classification for this contract is $14,000,000. Award will be made to up to seven of the most highly qualified firms and one or more contracts will be reserved for a qualified small business. The determination of which firms are the most highly qualified will be based on a subjective assessment of the evaluation board on the firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria included in the synopsis. A firm, either large or small, must at least meet the evaluation criteria to be considered "most highly qualified." If no small businesses are determined to be "most highly qualified," then no award will be made to a small business. Additionally, nothing prevents more than one small business being awarded a contract in the event they are more qualified than other large businesses. The highest ranked large and small businesses will then be invited to discussions. The number of firms invited for discussions will be sufficient such that up to seven IDIQ contracts may be awarded. A small business may be chosen over a higher ranked large business in order to meet the intent of the small business reservation. A small business will not be invited to a discussion if it cannot be determined most highly qualified by the evaluation board.<br />The general intent of task orders will not be to set them aside for small business should a small business be awarded a contract, however, the Government may set task orders aside in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F). <br />Large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan upon submission of their cost proposal should they be chosen for contract award. Small businesses will be required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.<br />Firms should state the words (LARGE BUSINESS) or (SMALL BUSINESS) in parentheses after the name of firm in PART I, A Block 5 of form SF 330. If a firm is competing for this contract as a joint venture, the firm must submit legal documentation along with their SF 330 documenting their status as a joint venture. The joint venture must also be registered in www.SAM.gov at the time of SF 330 submission. The legal documentation verifying the joint venture will not be considered part of the page limit for SF 330 submission.</p>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.

<AWARDEE>Rockwell Collins Network Enabling Software, Inc., 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IN 52498-0001 US
<DESC>This contract provides short term helpdesk and operator/administrator training for the fielded versions of the Close Air Support System (CASS) software. This software was developed by Rockwell-Collins under Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division contract N00164-07-D-6686 which included help desk support and training of the fielded software. NSWC Crane is negotiating a follow-on contract for this effort, but has not completed negotiations. The N001664-07-D-6686 contract expired on 28 September 2012. AFLCMC/HBDC determined that a bridge contract with a basic effort of 30 days of help-desk support with two options to extend service a further 30 days (90 days total) was required to insure continuous support. The contract also includes an option for one operator/administrator on-site training session.
<p>This is a sole source contract award for unusual and compelling urgency. An approved justification and determination for other than full and open competition is attached to this notice.</p>

The objective of this effort is to design, fabricate, and evaluate a promising active flow control concept on an oscillating airfoil for on-blade alleviation of dynamic stall. The concept must be evaluated over a range of Mach numbers (0.2 to 0.5) to substantiate the capabilities of the concept at representative Mach number and/or identify reasons for the loss in effectiveness. Several values of reduced frequency shall be evaluated at each Mach number tested.

<strong>North Branch, Real Estate Acquisition Division<br /></strong><strong>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition<br /></strong><strong>0PA2069</strong><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>U.S. Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Marshal Service</strong><strong> <br /></strong><strong>U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant Street<br /></strong><strong>Pittsburgh, PA</strong>
<p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<strong>1.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</strong></p>
<p>This justification is to allow an existing 5-year renewal option to be exercised for 44,982 ABOA square feet of office space. The current lease number is LPA70046.  The space consists of office with related space and courtrooms.</p>
<p>The current location is the U.S. Steel Tower, 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA. The current lease expires on November 2, 2012 and notice must be given on the renewal option on or before May 31, 2012.</p>
<p>The space consists of courtrooms, judge's chambers, U.S. Marshal Service security areas and general office support space including file storage and record keeping.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including estimated value).</strong></p>
<p>The agencies under this lease require a unique build-out which requires them to remain at this location, based on their requirements. The courtrooms, chambers, and related space are not typical improvements of normal office space and therefore these improvements would have to be reconstructed as an additional cost to the government. Exercising our right to renew the lease at this location will allow the government to forego the extensive build-out costs associated with rebuilding all of the tenant improvements required by the agencies.</p>
<p>The renewal option provides for the termination of a portion of space on the 53rd floor. Otherwise the renewal term is for a period of five years, firm.</p>
<p>The original lease term was from November 3, 1997 through November 2, 2012 with no previous sole source actions.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this action is as follows:</p>
<p>Firm Term:  $27.38* rate/RSF x 51,729 RSF = $1,416,799.44 (Annual Rent) x 5 years = $7,083,997.20</p>
<p>*-represents a rounded rate and includes additional components of rent, &lt;&lt;redacted&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.  Identification of the statutory authority</strong></p>
<p>41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.</p>
<p>At the current location there are three Courtrooms, each with related space for judges and support area for associated tenants (i.e., U.S. Marshal Service). Within the courtrooms and associated judges' &lt;REDACTED&gt;</p>
<p>Please reference the attached Cost-Benefit analysis which outlines the estimated cost savings by remaining at the current location. This analysis attempts to account for the extensive build-out that is required by the agencies including courtrooms which have extensive IT requirements, &lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt;, enhanced lobby security and private judge's chambers. The analysis shows a clear savings to the government by remaining at the current location and duplicating any finishes above the TI allowance would only further support this action. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to remain in the current location.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable</strong></p>
<p>In order to maximize competition &lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt; was searched for available properties and an advertisement was placed seeking other available options. In addition, existing GSA leases in and around the Pittsburgh CBD were used for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Please reference the attached market research memorandum, which details the search of &lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt; and a review of current locations through REXUS.</p>
<p>An advertisement was placed on Fedbizopps on April 20, 2012 for 15 calendar days. The details of the response(s) are explained further within this document under section 9.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</strong></p>
<p>The offered renewal rental rate of $27.38/RSF at this location is within the market range of &lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt;/RSF/Fully Serviced and below the average rental rate of GSA leases in the CBD of Pittsburgh. &lt;REDACTED&gt;. When accounting for the parking, antenna, and quality of the location and space, the offered renewal rental rate is in-line with the market.</p>
<p>The anticipated cost of exercising this lease action is fair and reasonable. Please see attached cost-benefit analysis for an outline of this anticipated cost.</p>
<p><strong>7.  Description of the market research conducted</strong></p>
<p>See attached Market Research Memorandum and Cost Benefit Analysis.</p>
<p><strong>8.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition</strong></p>
<p>All agencies within this current lease have stated that the current location is satisfactory and that they wish to remain. The GSA field office has indicated that this lessor is responsive to requests and has an overall satisfactory history of past performance. Remaining in the current location will allow the agency to continue their mission without any disruption.</p>
<p><strong>9.  List of any sources that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition</strong></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>10.  Statement of actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the proposed lease term, a fully competitive leasing action, if appropriate, will be initiated.</p>

<DESC>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to enter into a Sole Source bridge contract with SRC. The Sole Source bridge contract will cover a nine month period of performance for an effort to provide security operation center support services. This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the need for continuity of services between the existing effort and the ongoing effort to award a new competitive contract.

<DESC>SOLRS II is a deployable laser instrumented rehearsal training system tailored for littoral and urban warfare exercises. Each SOLRS II player unit/warfighter is equipped with a GPS-equipped instrumented vest that is compatible with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and the SOLRS I system. Each vest is designed to operate flawlessly during humid and submerged training environments of up to one meter depth, including salt water, and provides audio cues of weapon accuracy and wound simulations.<br />SOLRS II also features JF12 Frequency approved radios and a communication sub-system that relays engagement results from each player unit to the training operation center, which generates the training scenarios and AAR packages.<br />The components of SOLRS II will be supplementary and interchangeable to components delivered with original SOLRS I delivery. This will prevent the need of additional software that would be required for separate systems to communicate to the currently fielded system, thereby reducing the lifecycle cost of having to support two independent SOLRS training systems.<br />
