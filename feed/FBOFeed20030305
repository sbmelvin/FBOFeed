<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR 341) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals directed at applied and advanced development aspects of medical research focusing on the care of casualties resulting from hostile acts. There are insufficient data available on how to diagnose injuries inflicted by thermobaric weapons, and how to treat them. Models and therapeutic approaches to blast injury are encouraged as are triage and treatment methods for burns for the first responder.  Additional areas include hemostatic agents or devices that are affordable and capable of achieving hemostasis of soft tissue wounds; novel therapeutic interventions for shock; and improved delivery of fluids to hypotensive casualties.
In light of changes in threats, missions and protective equipment, the ONR is also interested in programs that would track the relative frequency of wound and injury types and area(s) of body affected in various operational settings (urban, desert, jungle) against symmetric and asymmetric opponents in various mission types (peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, etc).  We are also interested in programs that could: (1) accurately project effect of treatment delays on mortality/morbidity; (2) identify "critical" interventions; (3) produce wound/injury taxonomies, severity scoring, and characterization as to resource requirements; (4) track casualties; (5) casualty models specific for scenario, setting, unit size and weaponry.
The goals of the ONR Casualty Care and Management program are presented in more detail on the Internet at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/personnel/ and below.
In addition to the above areas, any novel approaches that may save lives on the battlefield or maintain functionality of the casualty will be considered, especially those that identify risk or enable mission completion without medical consequence. Techniques and technologies suitable for use by first responders or limited license practitioners are a priority.  Decision support system integration into diagnostic and therapeutic technologies is important.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the "Company"), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting an Expression Of Interest (EOI) from prospective vendors to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  This EOI serves as a method of identifying potential vendors; and is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies.  

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements:  reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved.  New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives.  Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals.  

The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this EOI to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels.  It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs.  It is broken into two subtopics for consideration.  

A.	SUBTOPIC I

The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles.  

Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control.  In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications.  However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control.  This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC.  The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device.  Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels.

Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production.  
It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases.  Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work.  Technological innovations will be highly encouraged.  A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented.  A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included.  A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones.  

The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip.   It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years.

B)	SUBTOPIC II

This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles.    It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW.  An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW.    The SOW will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs.  

The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations.  The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues.  The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units.  A viable path to production must be demonstrated.  A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively.  Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions.  Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified.  The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles.   A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation.  The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle.    It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. 

The intent of this EOI is to identify prospective vendors who can provide this support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  Teaming arrangements are acceptable.  Once viability of subcontracting part or all of this scope is determined by ORNL, a detailed RFP will be issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements.  Please provide your EOI submittal to Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or fax (865) 241-2426 by close of business March 20, 2003.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:
 
The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting abstracts and proposals for DARPAs Advanced Technology Office (ATO) to perform research, development, modeling, design, and testing to support the Dynamic Optical Tags (DOTs) program.  The goal of the DARPA DOTs program is to develop a small, thin, environmentally robust, long lived, modulated optical retro-reflecting tag and a long range interrogation system.  These devices will enable highly precise tag location and reliable and efficient information flow.  These devices will be non-RF and visually non-alerting.  
 
The DOTs program will develop modulating optical tags that are small, thin and retro-reflecting.  The tags will be passive (i.e. in the sleep mode) for most of its operation.  The tags will only activate when properly interrogated.  The tags will then begin to modulate the illuminating beam to transmit coded information on the retro-reflecting path.  The tags will operate in a wide temperature range and be non-visually alerting.  The program will also develop a tag specific transceiver system that is eye-safe, using automated scanning algorithms, and relies on a short search and interrogate timeline.  

These technologies directly support the identified needs of the military for reliable covert communications and precision tagging in various terrains, scenarios and situations.  The unique capabilities of optical communications and sensors are the critical enabling technologies for many different operations and system control problems found in these environments.
 
Tagging devices are currently being used by various Government agencies and branches of the military.  However, these devices usually depend on radio frequencies that can be detected by the tagged target or by other forces in the area of the emitter.  

These tags have a wide range of applications, and can be applied in numerous military operational and logistical applications as well as law enforcement situations.  





PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING:

The Government anticipates award of multiple contracts to explore the implications of covert 2-way data exchange with forces in friendly and denied areas (e.g. Logistics, Status, Sensors, Mission data) using non-radio frequency identification, location and tracking. The base and option periods for this project are expected to continue through FY 2007. The DARPA DOTs program will develop (1) modulating optical tags that are small thin and use retro-reflecting optics with a wide operation temperature range and are non-visually alerting; (2) a handheld interrogation system; (3) an advantaged location, i.e. airborne, tag specific transceiver system that will be eye-safe at the tag, can perform automated scanning and has a short search and interrogate timeline. 
 
The DOTs program will be in three phases.  
 
In Phase 1: Develop Optical Tag Technologies: Phase I will last 18 months and focus on the development and demonstration of the optical elements required to support the objectives of the DOTs program.  At the end of Phase I a tag will be demonstrated that; is no larger than 25mm x 25mm x 5mm; the tag will operate in an environment ranging from 70C to 40C; the tag shall have an angle of regard of plus or minus 60 or greater; the tag will have external electronics; the tag will modulate at least 100 kbits/sec;  the tag may use external electronic for this phase.  An interrogator will be demonstrated that: supports a range of 1 kilometer or greater; will use less than 800 watts prime power; and weigh less than 25 kilograms.  
 
In Phase 2: Design DOTs System:  Phase II will last 15 months and continue the development of the optical tag, develop the handheld interrogator, and design the advantaged location system, i.e. airborne system. At the end of Phase II; the tag will be demonstrated with integrated electronics and all of the features from Phase I; the handheld interrogator will be demonstrated the at 100 Kbps at 1Km;. the design the advantaged, i.e. airborne system, will support greater than 10 Km range at greater than 100 Kbps, be eye-safe at the tag, and will include the required search, acquisition, and track algorithms.
  
In Phase 3: Build and Demonstrate DOTs System: Phase III will last 15 months and concentrate on building and demonstrating the complete DOTs systems. This will include building the advantaged, i.e. airborne system, and support the transition of the DOTs system to the military.
 
Offerors should bid on the entire life of the program.  The base year (Phase 1) and option one (Phase 2) and option two (Phase 3).   

Government Funding Estimate:  The funding estimate for all Phases is as follows:

Phase 1:  The total awards for Phase 1 are anticipated to be approximately $7M for the basic effort (18 months).  It is anticipated that 3-5 awards will be made.  

Phase 2: Option 1 is anticipated to be approximately $15M (15 months).  It is anticipated that 2 awards will be made.   

Phase 3:  Option 2 is anticipated to be approximately $6.0M (15 months).  It is anticipated that 1 award will be made.

The Government reserves the right to change all of these values as it deems necessary.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial visitor services in Biscayne National Park, in Dade County, Florida, near Miami.  The operation will include interpretive boat tours, snorkel and dive trips, a water taxi service, canoe and kayak rentals, a gift shop, and sales of packaged snacks and refreshments.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $351,000 annually.  The term of this contract is expected to be seven years and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 2% of gross revenue per year.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected to be less than $500,000 in the first year of the contract.  The current concessionaire has been determined to have been a 'satisfactory' operator.  The current concessionaire is considered not to be a 'preferred offeror', which basically means that they do not have the right to match the terms of any better offer.  Offers must be received by 4:00pm.  The prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).  There will be an administrative charge to recoup the printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus.  Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service.  Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number.  All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, SW, Atlanta, GA, 30303.  No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored.  Please note that no further information that that provided above is available through any other Internet resources or links.  Concession Contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (the Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) is planning to award two (2) each, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) research and development contracts on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The statutory authority permitting other th an full and open competition for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), for supplies deemed available only from the original sources in the case of a follow-on contract for continued development of highly specialized equ ipment, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. This project is a follow on maturation effort with the Original Eq uipment Manufacturers (OEM's) associated with the integrated sensory package developed from the Future Scout Calvary System (FSCS) for potential use on the Future Combat System (FCS). Awards are projected for the 3rd QTR FY03 and Army RDT&E 6.3 FY03 funds will be used for this procurement. The anticipated period of performance for each contract is 8 months from date of award.  These contractual efforts will concentrate on three areas:1) Improvements in sensor processing maturation and for an integrated Auto matic Target Detection (ATD)/Aided Target Recognition (AiTR) to reduce system level faults and improve overall system reliability and improvement in quality of displayed images for better operator performance; 2) Radar studies are required that will assess  the feasibility of using only one versus two-vehicle radar using different bandwidths required for both the ATD/AiTR and Active Protection System (APS) applications.  This will also include the mast packaging/integration and the integration of the radar d ata into the ATD/AiTR and APS; 3) Engineering test support at a Government test site will be required and will culminate in final reports from each contractual effort for FCS considerations. The proposed contracts will not include option provisions. The Go vernment intends to use the Alpha Contracting process by commencing discussions with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon after 15 days from the date this synopsis is first posted in the FedBizOpps website.  No solicitation is currently available.  Contact the Con tract Specialist by email should you have any questions.  Please see FedBizOpps numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Postdoctoral
                      Research Fellowship Program

The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the DS&T's Chief Scientist announce a Fiscal Year 2003 competition for the
DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program. The mission of the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program is to
establish long-term relationships and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers and to provide research institutes with an
understanding of the Intelligence Community's research requirements. The program will foster partnerships with postdoctoral researchers as they move into career positions and provide innovative solutions to Critical Intelligence Community problems. Through this competition, the Chief Scientist (CS) expects to make awards in specific research topics. All awards will be based on merit competition. Depending on the quantity and quality of proposals received, the CS may not make any award(s) under a particular research topic. In the event more funds become available additional awards maybe made at a later date based on
initial evaluation results. Typically each award will be: for a basic period of one year (funded incrementally), with a potential
option for a second and third year, and for the amount of $100,000 per year/per grant. This DCI Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship Program competition is specifically for the research topics listed below. Offerors are advised to read the Broad
Agency Announcement BAA NMA 501-03-BAA-0001 at www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/baa.html. It explains the program
research needs upon which the topics are based and the terms and conditions of this competition. 

AREAS OF INTEREST: The BAA describes twenty-two (22) research areas, comprising some of the Intelligence Community's most current technology interests. These descriptions provide offerors with a frame of reference. The DCI encourages innovative ideas that address these interests. Offerors are urged to consider the research issues posed and, as appropriate, to contact our research topic chiefs to discuss potential efforts. Inquiries are welcome. Note that while technical contacts are listed for a topic, proposals must be submitted only to the addressees shown in the Broad Agency Announcement. With completion of the first phase, the call in this announcement is seeking qualified postdoctoral research investigators interested in being funded to support research in the specified topical areas and to support interactions with the Intelligence Community advisors. Potential Fellows must be associated with an accredited U.S. university or college. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must be a U.S. citizen. The principal investigator / university mentor, is NOT required to be an U.S. Citizen. 

SUBMISSION HIGHLIGHTS. The Government will evaluate all proposals submitted under the terms and conditions of this
BAA. Government-paid consultants or subject matter experts may be involved in the evaluation and selection processes.
General. The CS, through NIMA as his executive agent, intends to award with FY03 funding. To be considered and evaluated
the Government must receive the full proposal by the due time and date (26 March 2003) identified in the BAA. NIMA will
send the offeror an acknowledgment of receipt of the submission, and will follow-up later with a notification letter announcing
whether the proposal is being recommended for an award. Acknowledgment and notification will be sent to the principal
investigator via e-mail, according to the schedule in the BAA, with a copy to the appropriate university administrative office.
Proposals will be evaluated against criteria in the BAA. The estimated grant start date identified in BAA should be used for
budget and proposal purposes. You may, however, request a later start date and may therefore develop your budget based on
your proposed start date. Submission. Proposals shall be formatted as one .doc file (or "zipped".doc file) of a size not to
exceed 1.95 Megabytes in total. The Government's mail servers will not accept files of a greater size. The proposal shall
reference BAA Number NMA 501-03-BAA-0001. Proposals shall be submitted electronically by e-mail and simultaneously
to MoorJA@nima.mil and mpf it@ticomeast.com. Content: Proposals must be complete and self-contained to qualify for
review. Proposals shall be prepared single-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font, with at least one-inch margins on top,
bottom and sides, on 8" by 11" paper. The Intelligence Community is concerned with research in specific areas of science
and engineering. For this reason, all proposals must adequately describe the technical objectives and approaches, support of
principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and expenditures for equipment, all of which will be evaluated by qualified
reviewers. Separate attachments, such as institutional brochures or reprints that are not germane to the proposal, are
discouraged. The proposal shall include all of the following items. Cover Page The cover page shall include the BAA number
(NMA501-03-BAA-0001), proposal title, and topic or research area of interest. The cover page must also indicate the name,
phone number, fax number, postal address, and e-mail address of both the principal investigator AND an appropriate official in
the university's research administration office. 

Project Description: The project description portion of the proposal shall be limited to three pages and shall: Describe the
proposed research objectives and approach to be undertaken. State the objectives and approach and the relationship to
state-of-knowledge in the field and to similar work in progress. Include appropriate literature citations and prior work. Discuss
the nature of expected results. Describe the expected outcomes and relevance to the Intelligence Community research need.
Identify other parties to whom the proposal has been/will be sent. 

Resume: The Resume shall be limited to two (2) pages each and shall provide the credentials of the principal investigator,
demonstrating why the offeror is qualified to do the work proposed. If a Postdoctoral Fellow has been identified, an additional resume, two (2) pages in length, may also be included. 

Cost: Beginning on a new page, the financial portion of the proposal should contain cost estimates in sufficient detail for
meaningful review. The annual cost must be no greater than $100,000. At least 50% of this cost should be allocated for direct
support of one full-time Postdoctoral Fellow, including salary and fringe benefits. The remaining funds can be allocated to a
fraction of the principal investigator's time, unique equipment needed to conduct the proposed research, other direct costs and
university overhead. For proposal purposes, use the later of the estimated award start date per BAA or the offeror's proposed
start date. Exceptions to the above-recommended allocation will need to be approved by the Chief Scientist. The cost proposal
must include the total cost of the project, as well as a breakdown of the amounts by source of funding (e.g., funds requested from the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program, and/or institutional funds to be provided as cost sharing). The costs should be broken down for each year of the program and shown by three distinct totals: a total for the basic year and a total for each of the optional follow-on years. Although expected to be short, there is no page limit for the cost section of the proposal. Cost elements should include, but are not limited to: Time being charged to the project by the principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and their commensurate salaries and benefits. Costs of equipment based on most recent quotations and
broken down in sufficient detail for evaluation (equipment costs should be budgeted primarily during the first year). Allowable
equipment will ordinarily be limited to research equipment and apparatus not already available for the conduct of the work.
General-purpose equipment, such as a personal computer, is not eligible for support unless primarily used in the actual conduct
of the proposed scientific research. Travel costs and time, and the relevance to stated objectives. This shall include a
breakdown of the name and number of travelers, location and duration; and estimated costs for transportation, rental car and
per-diem. This shall also include travel for the required attendance at the annual DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
Program colloquium in the spring of each year. The colloquium is held in the Washington D.C. area. Other direct costs such as
materials and supplies; publication, documentation and dissemination; computer services; communication costs not included in overhead; or others (identify). These costs shall include at least one published article per year in the Journal of Intelligence Community Research and Development (JICRD). This published article will need to be coordinated, vetted and submitted through the IC Advisor. Cetifications: By signing and submitting any proposal under this BAA, the offeror is certifying
Certification at Appendix A to 32 CFR Part 25 regarding debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters; Certification at Appendix C to 32 CFR Part 25 regarding drug-free workplace requirements; and Certification at Appendix A to 32 CFR
Part 28 regarding lobbying. These certifications are located in Parts 25 and 28 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulation
(DoDGARs), D0D 3210.6-R. This document is available electronically, under the heading "publications", at the following
Internet site: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/. The person who is authorized to provide these certifications should sign the
proposal. Proposals submitted without signatures shall require a separate execution of the certifications. Also, it will be
necessary for either the Dean or Provost at the University to acknowledge that they are receiving CIA Funds. Awards will be
made for one year with two one-year options. The Government expects to exercise the first year option assuming quality
research is ongoing. Second year option will be the exception, rather than the rule. The awards will be incremental funded at
funding levels no greater than $100,000 per year, per award/option period. Once a proposal is selected for award, one of two scenarios will be executed: If a postdoctoral candidate is already identified and prepared to begin the proposed research,
100% of the first year's award funding could be provided by the start date. If a qualified postdoctoral candidate must be
sought, $10,000 of the award amount will be provided initially, with the remaining first year's funding provided when the
qualified candidate is identified and selected by the university.

<DESC>General Objectives and Requirements This Statement of Work (SOW) is being issued on behalf of the U.S. Equal Em= ployment Opportunity Commission located at 1801 L Street NW, Washington, D.= C. 20507.  EEOC is requesting qualified Offerors to provide a Fixed Price (= FP) response to the tasks described in this SOW. Notice:  This is a summary=   SOW for industry.  It is not inclusive of all required task to complete t= he requirement.   =20 Title of Project EEOC Training and Outreach Online Registration Operations Purpose of the Project The purpose of the SOW is to contract with a full service firm for registra= tion and payment processing services.  It is the intent of EEOC to outsourc= e the following: Registration Payment processing=09=09 Electronic Marketing =09=09 The following tasks may be outsourced based on feasibility: Fulfillment/Mail Production/Lettershop Operations including warehousing and=  distribution Training Site Logistics=20 =09=09 Background Current Revolving Fund Division Operation =20 The Revolving Fund Division (RFD) is responsible for operations relating to=  training, event registration, direct sales orders, payment processing for = training events and direct sales, customer contact and service, and direct = marketing.  These functions are currently being supported by numerous datab= ase applications performing a variety of functions.  All RFD staff are full= -time and work at headquarters. Currently, the foremost methods of receipt of registration for seminars and=  sign-up courses is  through the US Postal Service (USPS) and fax.  Registr= ation is handled through the manual input of data into a database within th= e Marketing, Sales and Registration System (MSRS), to include customer spec= ific information such as name, company name, company address, telephone num= bers, payment information, and various other data elements.=20 After the participants are registered and payment has been processed, field=  office staff responsible for presenting the seminar generate the registrat= ion list and nametags via the MSRS web-based registration system and check = in registrants on the day of the seminar.  It is RFD policy to only registe= r individuals who have provided payment, so there are only a small number o= f  walk-in participants and pay-at-the -door registrants, usually less than=  10 per seminar.  After each seminar is completed, the field office prepare= s a closeout package for each seminar, including walk-in registration infor= mation and payments collected on-site.  The package is then sent to the Cus= tomer Service Representatives for final processing, updating of the MSRS re= cords, and  seminar closeout.  Field staff involved in supporting the regis= tration function are not RF staff and the cost of their time supporting the=  registration function is reimbursed to the EEOC. The RFD currently contracts out fulfillment, mailing and letttershop operat= ions and internally does its own email marketing. Marketing, Sales and Registration System (MSRS) The MSRS system is a web-based application utilized by RFD operations to re= gister and track information for all seminar and sign-up course participant= s.  MSRS is a developed application with maintenance support now being prov= ided to RFD through the Office of Information Technology (OIT).  The MSRS w= as initially designed to coordinate the registration function between the R= FD headquarters management and the PAs in the field who manage the day-to-d= ay operations associated with Technical Assistance Program Seminar (TAPS). =  At the time of implementation, the system allowed for improved management = of TAPS by allowing both RFD Headquarters and field offices to access MSRS = and view the registration of TAPS participants.  In addition, it provided a=  central source to store data on the type of payment, business information = and individual participant information.  Both RFD Headquarters and field st= aff personnel can enter and retrieve information.  Data is available from t= he system for each seminar/sign-up course and information is retrievable by=  registrant or organization name.  The system can produce class lists and n= ame tags. The MSRS uses Internet technology and a Wide Area Network with browser-base= d access by RFD Headquarters and field office staffs.  The application was = built using ASP code and an Access database on the back-end. RFD Headquarte= rs and field office staff personnel can view and edit all information in th= e MSRS.  Currently, the system does not allow any registration process to o= ccur directly from the Internet.  While the registrant information is store= d on a web-based application, it does not allow for attendees to enter, vie= w or change any personal registration information without contacting RFD He= adquarters.  This inefficiency therefore places a large burden on RFD staff=  members to enter all of the data collected for registration via phone, fax= , email or mail. Financial Applications EEOC's Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) utilizes the Departmen= t of Interior National Business Center's Federal Financial System (FFS) to = manage the general ledger, budget execution, receipt and payment, procureme= nt and reporting functions.  FFS was originally designed and developed by A= merican Management Systems headquartered in Fairfax, VA.  RFD personnel pro= cess all registrants' accounting information through this mainframe applica= tion. For payment processing between federal agencies, EEOC utilizes the Intra-Go= vernmental Payment and Collection system (IPAC).  IPAC is the web-based int= eragency financial system designed and operated by the Department of Treasu= ry that serves to eliminate cash or check transactions between Government a= gencies.=20 Training Events RFD is responsible for many different types of training seminars.  Training=  events that require  participant information collection are entered into M= SRS.  These include all Technical Assistance Program Seminars (TAPS) and si= gn-up courses.  MSRS does not contain information on product sales or custo= mer-specific training.  The following outlines the types of training offere= d by RFD: Technical Assistance Program Seminar (TAPS)=BF  Seminars are conducted at o= ff-site locations, usually hotels or conference centers.  Between 50 and 60=  such seminars are held annually. These seminars are one or two full days i= n length and meals are provided, such as lunch, and snacks during mid-morni= ng and mid-afternoon breaks.  Breakout sessions are held during these meeti= ngs requiring between one and three extra rooms for these sessions.  The ma= jority of speakers are EEOC district or headquarters employees, but outside=  speakers are also utilized, usually on a no-fee basis.  EEOC employees fro= m  district offices located nearby handle on-site logistics support. TAPS s= eminars historically average approximately 160 people per seminar. (For spe= cific information on locations, see Appendix A - TAPS Locations). Half-day TAPS: These  seminars are similar in nature to the above, however = they are conducted in only half-day sessions, therefore do not require meal= s to be provided. Average attendance is approximately 30 people.  The numbe= r held each year ranges from none to as many as six. =20 EXCEL TAPS:This multi-day seminar occurs only once per year, and is always = held at an off-site location to accommodate its size (recent ones have been=  held at Atlantic City).  This  seminar is generally one week in length wit= h registration beginning Monday afternoon, and the final sessions closing F= riday morning. Again, this  seminar is modeled after the standard TAPS  sem= inar, however because of its length requires greater planning.  It is also = much larger in scale attracting over 500 attendees last year.  In the futur= e, additional multi-day TAPS may be scheduled.=20 =09=09 Sign-up Courses:Currently the only sign-up courses offered are those delive= red to Federal employees at the EEOC headquarters training site and  EEOC o= ffice sites in 5 regional federal centers (Chicago, Dallas, Denver, San Fra= ncisco and Atlanta) and do not require on-site logistics.  Sign-up courses = are either full day or multi-day, and training is delivered by EEOC trainer= s.  Attendance averages approximately 30 people per session.  Approximately=  30 of these courses are taught each year. Additional sign-up courses are p= lanned for the future for private sector employees and these also will be h= eld in EEOC training facilities.=20 Customer Specific Training (CST):These courses are designed to deliver EEO = information on-site at corporate or  federal, state or local agency locatio= ns.  The registration system (MSRS) is not used for these courses and CST's=  require no on-site logistics support.  An agreement is made between EEOC a= nd the customer to deliver training at a certain price and one payment is g= enerated.   A limited amount of information on the company /organization  i= s obtained from the agreement and tracking of payments for on-site training=  is done through a WordPerfect table.  EEOC employees located in regional o= ffices throughout the country perform this training.   About 200 agreements=  are entered into yearly covering about 400 training events (some contracts=  are for more than one session). Attendance per session  is approximately 3= 5 people. =09=09 For specific information on the EEOC or the RFD, please see our website at = www.eeoc.gov .=20 Current Functions & Operations The RFD staff presently perform the following functions and operations: Process  training requests (submitted on registration forms received by mai= l and through direct customer contact by telephone and electronic mail) fro= m individuals who will attend Revolving Fund training events (TAPS and Sign= -Up Courses) and maintaining a database of key registrant data (MSRS).=20 Take orders (submitted on order forms received by mail and through direct c= ustomer contact by telephone and electronic mail) from customers for direct=  sales items and maintaining a database of key customer data. =09=09 Receive copies of training agreements for customer-specific training and ma= intain tracking system for collection of payment. Collect training fees and direct sales payments in the form of checks, cred= it cards, and electronic payments, entering collection data into an automat= ed accounting system, and issuing invoices when applicable. Notify customers to confirm reservations for training events. Deliver training event material to registrants and direct sales items to cu= stomers through fulfillment. Maintain and update mailing files derived from database of key registrant a= nd customer data. Manage accounts receivable through collection and write-off consistent with=  Federal practices. Market programs through mail and electronic means. Perform all financial management, account reconciliation and reporting serv= ices using the IFMS.=20 =09 Staff in field office presently perform the following on-site logistics sup= port for RF events: For TAPS Prepare statement of work for seminar location (hotel or other meeting spac= e) to include meeting rooms, food and audio-visuals. Review bids from hotels/other meetings spaces, visit and view sites and neg= otiate contract. Design program agenda, create slide shows and handout materials and invite = outside speakers, as appropriate, and deliver all or most of the sessions. Arrange for duplication of handout materials.=20 Coordinate and trouble-shoot day of seminar on-site logistics with hotel (A= V, meeting rooms,  food service and signage).=20 Check in participants and provide handout materials to attendees and handle=  a limited number of new registrations/pay at the door payments.=20 =09=09 Distribute and collect evaluations. =20 =09 =09 For CST Prepare agreement with company or organization client for delivery of on-si= te training course(s) and send copy of agreement to RFD. Deliver training at client's site. =20 For Sign-Up Courses Arrange for use of EEOC space or other free or low fee space for course. Order copies of handout materials from RFD or EEOC's Publications Distribut= ion Center.=20 Set-up AV equipment owned by EEOC and deliver training. Project Tasks and Associated Deliverables Using a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or equivalent application, the Cont= ractor must propose a solution that replaces MSRS and includes any alternat= ives to the execution of current Revolving Fund functions and operations (S= ection 1.4).  The goal is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of b= oth manual and computer-based operations, incorporating best business pract= ices. The solution recommended by the Contractor must include the ability f= or on-line (Web-based) registration with electronic payment (including cred= it cards, invoicing, and cash reconciliation) by RFD customers.  The system=  solution must include seamless and integrated registration, sales and paym= ent data processing with maximum use of computer technology interfacing wit= h EEOC's financial system, delivery of confirmation notices to customers up= on payment verification;  recording of payments through Treasury accounts, = i.e., contracting using Department of  Treasury for electronic lockbox acce= ss; and, integrating with current EEOC IFMS and computer systems (see Appen= dix B).  In addition, the RFD currently has an interagency agreement for it= s fulfillment operation and has a separate contract for the lettershop mail= ing operations. RFD wants to explore the possible integration of the mailin= g (postal and email) and fulfillment operations with the registration funct= ion; whereby, minimizing cost associated with data processing/mail list man= agement and contract administration of a single contract verse multiple con= tracts. The recommended system solution must also include electronic market= ing as well as conference room scheduling and logistics planning with hotel= s or conference facilities for multi-day seminars.  A list of seminar locat= ions is outlined in Appendix A - TAPS :locations Description of Tasks The Contractor must complete the following proposed tasks or equivalent ste= ps to meet the objective of this statement of work and provide the project = management with the appropriate documentation to support the completion of = the project:=20 Project Planning Transition to Outsourced Registration Services including direct sales Full Implementation of Registration Outsourcing Fulfillment/ Lettershop Operations (Optional) and Site Logistic Support (Op= tional) Task 1:Project Planning Coordinate and Facilitate Project Kick-Off Meeting=20 The Contractor will coordinate a kickoff meeting with EEOC representatives.=   This initial meeting will provide a forum for all involved parties to add= ress any potential issues and concerns that could impact future work activi= ties or the delivery of required services.  This initial meeting also will = provide an opportunity to confirm project priorities, address proposed appr= oaches and supporting rationale, and review the requirements of all deliver= ables and services to be provided during project performance.  This meeting=  will provide the basis for developing the detailed Project Management Plan=  and Timeline that will be delivered by the Contractor.  The Contractor wil= l document all discussions, action items, and issues before submission for = EEOC's review and approval. Prepare Project Management Plan and Timeline The Contractor will develop a project management plan that outlines key act= ivities for replacing the current system within EEOC's RFD operations.  The=  plan should include key milestones and expected end products or outcomes a= ssociated with each task.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: The MILSATCOM Joint Program Office (MJPO), HQ Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is interested in receiving proposals on the research and development effort described in Section B below for the Multi-Access Laser Communication Head (MALCH) study. This is a full and open competition for the award of up to three Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts in accordance with FAR SubPart 35.016, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), as modified for the Air Force's Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) process. Proposals shall be submitted by 18 November 2002 at 1600 hours, Pacific Standard Time (PST), and addressed to: SMC/MCK, Attn: 1Lt Nikki Thomas, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467-A8, El Segundo CA 90245-4659.  The small business size standard NAICS 541710 (1000 employees) applies.  Offerors must be registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration database (http://www.ccr.gov/) to be eligible for contract award. Proposals must comply with this announcement. Proposals received after the specified cutoff date will not be considered for evaluation. The Government reserves the right to amend this PRDA solicitation and Offerors should be alert for any amendments that may be published. This notice constitutes the solicitation for this requirement; no RFP or other solicitation will be issued. Guidance on the PRDA process may be found in the Air Force Research Laboratory BAA and PRDA Industry Guide at the following website (http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract).

B. REQUIREMENTS: (1) TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: (a) Introduction: A key element of Transformational Communications (TC) is laser communication (lasercomm) support for a diverse set of Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) platforms (i.e., Global Hawk, U2, MC2A). Forecasted user needs project 10 vehicles in each of 2 theaters plus an additional 4 vehicles worldwide with data rates of up to 2.5 Gbps per vehicle. The system concept must take into account ISR platforms that will have highly asymmetric links as well as MC2A and Airborne Communications Networks (ACN) platforms, which will require two-way symmetrical link. The Multi-Access Laser Communication Head (MALCH) is a space-based optical system that can provide simultaneous laser communications with a number of airborne users. The MJPO currently believes that MALCH can achieve the desired capabilities at significantly reduced cost, weight, and power, and it is thus considered a critical enabling technology for the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA). Traditional single axis laser communication systems that meet system requirements for communication to one asset can be used as a starting point for modification, or new concepts can be developed to allow for a multi-access system. Any plan should be developed with a goal of a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by 2006. (b) PRDA Objectives: The purpose of this PRDA is to make up to three awards for research and development on a range of MALCH alternatives with an 11-month period of performance. The study should address the following high-level objectives: (i) Develop system requirements and design constraints. Initial requirements should use: the above number, types; and data rates of air assets; known spacecraft and space environments; connectivity with the Transformational Communication Architecture (TCA); and interoperability. Design constraints should address both terminal and space segments. Offerors should keep in mind the growing capabilities of the lasercomm link, MALCH for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communications, and increased access links; (ii) Develop conceptual designs and assessments. Some alternative conceptual designs may include movable feed concepts, adaptive optics, optical phased arrays, etc. Provide recommendations and key performance metrics for critical technology development and prioritize these needs. Identify key technical performance measures (TPMs) for the system concept. Provide risk/benefit analysis of meeting TPMs. Create a plan to manage risk identified within the TPMs. Perform design trades using experimentation, simulation, and analysis to arrive at a recommended design; (iii) Identify relevant cost/benefit parameters with the goal of low-cost, reduced complexity theater terminal development; and (iv) Provide the technology development and prototyping efforts needed to reduce risks of selected technologies and design concepts to acceptable levels for inclusion in near-term program developments. This effort should include laboratory demonstrations of critical technologies traceable to system concepts. Include cost and schedule estimates, risk management approaches, and verification and validation test plans. Develop conceptual designs of prototype (e.g., breadboard/brassboard) hardware and test equipment. (2) DELIVERABLE ITEMS: The following items are required contract deliverables at the end of the 11-month period of performance: (i) Systems requirements allocation and design constraints; (ii) Architectural description and associated design characteristics of an end-state system capable of being modeled in the Aerospace Corp. Concept Design Center. This should include the key Technical Performance Measures; (iii) Draft performance specifications of the system concept; (iv) Initial technology concept traceable to system requirements; (v) Cost benefit parameter analysis description; (vi) Plan covering program risk reduction and risk management approaches; (vii) Integrated program master schedule; and (viii) monthly Technical meetings with the Government Transformational Communication Office (TCO).  The meetings may consist of, but are not limited to, teleconferencing and video teleconferencing. Final deliverables shall not contain proprietary information. (3) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (a) This acquisition may require access to classified material. Each PRDA contract will contain a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254). Work performed under this acquisition may be classified up to the DOD SECRET level. (b) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Contracts will be awarded only to US companies. Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting is not allowed. Proposals must be submitted with information no higher then SECRET classification. Proposals containing classified material must be delivered/transmitted via normal security procedures IAW NISPOM guidance to the address and point of contact indicated in Section A. (4) GOVERNMENT BUDGET: The Government's estimated budget of $2.7M for this PRDA effort may be divided between three contracts. Contracts may be awarded for unequal amounts.

C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: (1) This PRDA is available at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov. (2) No Pre-Proposal Conference will be conducted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

NIAAA anticipates awarding a five (5) year, cost-plus-award-fee performance based contract as a result of this solicitation. The incumbent contract was awarded to CSR, Incorporated, Arlington, Virginia, in the total amount of $4,159,335 for a five year period of performance. All responsible small business concerns may submit an offer which will be considered by this agency. The Request for Proposal document will be available on or about February 20, 2003 at the following website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIVNAVSURFWARCEN) has interest in proposals for designing, analyzing and manufacturing a coextrusion system to be used in highly solids filled polymer, 70-80 % solids fill, applications. The system will be used in Indian Head Divisions pilot scale propellant processing facility.  The system should be capable of combining melt flows from a Werner & Pfleiderer, W&P, 40-mm twin-screw extruder and from a W&P 37-mm twin-screw extruder positioned ninety degrees from each other.  The 40-mm TSE will be the extruder positioned in line with the coextrusion die.  The configuration of the coextrusion product will be an ABA type.  The A layers will come from the 37-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches and a thickness of about 0.015 inches.  The B layer will come from the 40-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches  and a thickness of about 0.080 inches.  The manufacturer should provide the transition piece that will feed the melt flows from the extruders to the coextrusion die.  Circulating water/propylene glycol mixture will provide temperature control for the coextrusion die.  The system should be capable of venting in the event that either or both extruders reach a pressure of 3,000 psi and should be designed such that no stagnation of material occurs inside the die.  The coextrusion system should also provide features to control flow, to adjust layer distributions and correct layer instabilities. It should also include die lip adjustment for overall thickness, edge trimming capability and a remote take away spooling system for product collection. The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1, Group D and Class II, Division 1, Groups E, F and G requirements.   The proposal shall include: a three-dimensional flow model analysis for the coextrusion system.  The data required from the flow analysis would be pressure distributions, shear stress, shear rates and residence time in different regions of the die.  The manufacturer should also provide graphical data of temperature, pressure, shear rate and residence time distributions in the die along with volumetric flow rate of the die. Engineering procedures for assembling, disassembling, cleaning and operating the coextrusion system should also be included as well as system oversight during an inert coextrusion run.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center will provide, after contract award, the data required by the manufacturer for the flow analysis and three-dimension model  Offerors may submit a one-page abstract of their proposal.  Any offeror whose abstract is found to  be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal.

<DESC>This Amendment 2: 1) extends the due date for receipt of proposals until 2:00 p.m. EST, Wednesday, March 12, 2003.; 2) provides an explicit requirement for offerors to ACKNOWLEDGE ALL AMENDMENTS to this solicitation with their proposal; and 3) provides a list of questions received from prospective offerors and the answers from the BBG.  The following are questions provided by prospective offerors followed by the associated answers provided by BBG.


1. Question:  We assume you want a quote on the hardware to run the system, as well as managing the hardware, software and Operating Systems on that hardware.  Does this organization have existing contracts with hardware or software vendors that need to be considered? 

Answer:  We do NOT want a quote on the hardware to run the system.  The quote should be only on the line items provided in the solicitation document posted on the FBO web site.  The second part of the question does not apply to this procurement.


2. Question:  There is a requirement that the system be "off-the-shelf". We have a content management system that we have sold before, but it is not "off-the-shelf" due to the highly custom nature of each installation.  Also, as Cold Fusion does not compile, there is no adequate method to protect Cold Fusion code in an "off-the-shelf" system. Therefore, we would be proposing that our core or "off-the-shelf" reusable software object code would be customized to fit this organizations needs.  Is that acceptable to them? 

Answer:  This proposed solution is not acceptable.  The BBG is looking for a true off-the-shelf commercial item that does not need to be customized to meet the BBG's needs.


3. Question:  Would the CMS need to be deployed locally on a lot of workstations or can it all be done via Internet connections and a browser? 

Answer: The solution should not require any installation on a contributor workstation.  All work should be performed through a browser interface via TCP/IP.

4. Question:  The solicitation states:  "The CMS shall have the ability to be extended through the development of custom Cold Fusion modules developed by IBB or IBB contractors. "   This is contrasted by the desire for this organization to have an upgrade and maintenance contract.  Do they wish to buy the code from us (therefore they could do anything they want with it except resell it), or do they want us to build and maintain?  It would be very costly to have us guarantee and maintain code that is being modified by third parties. 

Answer:  The BBG seeks a site license.  The BBG will not modify the core CMS code; however, the BBG will extend the product through custom modules.   The upgrade and maintenance line item is to cover software patches, security patches, core product code revisions, etc.  

5. Question:  Where are the production servers now? Can they be relocated? Should this proposal also include us hosting the web sites themselves? What are the traffic requirements for the web sites? Are they located in multiple locations? 

Answer: This question is not relevant to this procurement.  Production servers are hosted at a 3rd party hosting facility and will not be relocated.  Web log statistics for the 1st quarter of this year give the following information: 50,929 visits per day, 202,688 pages per day. Servers are located in a single location.  The proposal should not include the offeror hosting the web sites.

6. Question:  Is there any known quantity of data for multimedia assets? 100 gigabytes? Terabytes? 

Answer: No, there is not a known limit.  Current assets are approximately 50 gigabytes.  This is expected to grow towards a terabyte within a year.


7. Question:  Does the multi media include media that needs to on a dedicated media server farm? If so is it in Windows, Real or Quicktime or a combination of each? 

Answer: The media does not need to be on a dedicated media server farm.  The media is a combination of both Windows and Real media.


8. Question:  Does the content management system need the ability to convert either file formats such as Photoshop to Jpeg, or media files from .AVI to .WMV? 

Answer: The CMS does not need the ability to convert file formats.


9. Question:  What is the estimate of the total number of pages on the sites to be managed by the CMS?  The traffic volume, daily and monthly? 

Answer: Due to the fact that the pages are generated dynamically from ColdFusion templates, it is difficult to obtain a count of the total number of pages managed by the CMS.  It is easily in the thousands.  Web log statistics for the 1st quarter of this year give the following information: 50,929 visits per day, 202,688 pages per day.


10. Question:  How many users license are required?  How many are just content contributors or authors?  How many are editors? 

Answer:  The BBG seeks a license that will comply with the requirements of line item 1 in the solicitation document which states: "the CMS shall permit a minimum of 300 simultaneous IBB contributors to publish and manage web
content."  These "contributors" are the same as "authors".  The number of editors is roughly between 15 and 30.  


11. Question:  We have deployed [name of application] utilizing an application service provider (ASP) model where the software and websites reside on our servers in [location within United States].  Would the Broadcasting Board of Governors consider utilizing this approach? 

Answer:  No.


12. Question:  Can we substitute a live demonstration website URL for the installation CD required for the proposal? 

Answer:  No.


13. Question:  We have electronic help files rather than a manual.  Can these electronic files be submitted in lieu of a manual? 

Answer:  No.  


14. Question:  We have extensive experience training organizations on the use of the [name of application].  We do not, however, have a formal training program available through 3rd part consultants.   Can we provide references who have been trained by our staff in lieu of this requirement? 

Answer: No.


15. Question:  We have a long list of satisfied organizations that are currently using the [name of application].  Our tool would not be known to 3rd party vendors, however.  Can we substitute our client references for this requirement? 

Answer:  No.


16. Question:  Is it possible to receive an electronic copy of the above RFP? 

Answer:  This requirement is posted at the FBO web site [www.fbo.gov] which does not allow document formatting.


17. Question:  I have a question about the Broadcasting Board of Governors request for a Content Management System.  Does this contract require GSA? 

Answer:  No.


18. Question:  The solicitation implies that this new application will reside on the IBB's current server configuration. Will you be looking for ongoing support for the applications developed or will internal staff be responsible for managing this on a day to day basis? 

Answer:  This procurement does not include day to day support.


19. Question:  Are there 8A considerations? 

Answer:  As stated in the FBO announcement in item (iv), this is an unrestricted procurement; however, this solicitation does include FAR Clause 52.219-23, Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns.


20. Question:  On the multi-language requirement, does the product's interface have to truly support those listed languages or is the requirement for posting information only? 

Answer: The requirement is for posting of content only.


21. Question:  Please mail us the RFP documents so that we can submit to you a comprehensive project proposal. 

Answer:  All information required to prepare and submit a proposal for this procurement is located on the FBO web site.  No additional information will be mailed to vendors.

Repair of three, 3-leaf guillotine type doors in building 137, Robins AFB. Each leaf is approximately 7'X55'. Repairs will consist of the replacement of rope sheaves and bearings on the drive shaft, changing the single chain drive to a double chain drive and repairs to the operator and adjustments to the  counter-balancing system. Some of the parts needed to complete the repairs, will have to be locally manufactured. Repairs will also require the replacement of approximately 200' of cable and new weather-stripping on each set of doors. The motorized door operator will need to be repaired; the gearbox and brakes are worn and damaged and will need to be repaired or rebuilt. Other repairs, undetectable now, may be required after work has begun. Overall, the doors need to be repaired into a fully operational condition. Period of performance is estimated at 30-45 days, depending on availability of the hangar bay.

DESCRIPTION:  Fire Prevention Education Team Coordinator, Performance Based Statement of Work 
Background 
The National Fire Prevention and Education Team (NFPET) program has been serving on an interagency basis throughout the United States since 1996.  NFPETs are typically mobilized and deployed to locales, which are experiencing higher than normal wildfire danger or a high incidence of human caused wildfires.  Their primary role is to supplement and support the wildfire prevention efforts of local personnel and agencies.  They have proven to be highly successful at reducing the occurrence of unwanted human caused wildfires, through the use of trained specialists and state-of-the-art communication and education techniques.  Prior to the 2002 wildfire season, NFPETs had been requested by federal and state agencies in 20 states.  Numerous additional requests were received during 2002.

From 1996 through the 2002 wildfire season, the training, equipping and mobilization of NFPETs was conducted on an ad hoc basis.  Although widely recognized as a successful entity, and provided for in recent editions of the National Mobilization Plan, NFPETs and team members often had to overcome mobilization, logistical, financial, organizational and demobilization challenges in order to successfully accomplish an assignment.

In 2001, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's (NWCG) Wildland Fire Education Working Team (WFEWT) expressed an interest in sponsoring the NFPET program and assembled a task force to develop a three-year strategy which would to lead to the program being recognized and managed as a true national, interagency resource.  The resulting ?National Fire Prevention and Education Teams Three Year Strategy? provided mission and vision statements, outlined focus areas, and presented strategies and tasks necessary for this concept to proceed.  Members of the task force included subject-matter experts from the Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In January 2002, the WFEWT reviewed and approved the three-year strategy and presented it to the NWCG.  The NWCG subsequently accepted the concepts embodied in the strategy and approved an annual budget allocation for three years.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Request for Information (RFI) from remote sensing technology companies and organizations who are using remote sensing technologies to measure water quality in the coastal zone.  The information gathered from this RFI may be used to explore pilot projects that test this capability.  


DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center is issuing this RFI to determine the present state of the art and availability of remote sensing imaging technologies that can be used in an operational capacity to measure water quality.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) but rather is an exploratory request to determine the availability of approaches to quickly accomplish the goal of collecting water quality data at an appropriate scale for state and local resource managers to use the data in support of management decisions. 

State coastal management programs monitor water quality to comply with state and federal regulations.  Currently, most of this monitoring is performed by sampling from small boats.  The Center believes there potentially is a market for remote sensing of water quality and is interested in evaluating the current operational technology.  The information gathered from this RFI may be used to contract out pilot projects that examine the capability of these technologies to help coastal managers measure water quality operationally.  

The RFI seeks the following information:
1.	Feasible procedures (e.g., instruments, sensors, data processing, flight parameters) to collect water quality data via remote sensing in the coastal zone
	Water quality parameters of interest include chlorophyll concentration, turbidity, temperature, and salinity.  We would like information on your ability to provide any or all of these.  Absolute accuracy of retrieval is negotiable, especially to meet the needed delivery time. 
	Any remote sensing technique may be used, but must be usable operationally.  Any type of algorithm may be used to retrieve water quality products from the raw instrument measurements, but must be documented and validated.
	Horizontal resolution (pixel-size) should be no greater than 3 meters, with a horizontal location accuracy of 10 meters or less.
	Geographic Scope: For comparison purposes, consider collecting data over an area the size of Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, approximately 250 km2 (Figure 1).
	Licensing: The Government must be free to redistribute the data in any form.
	Data format: Negotiable, but a geographically registered image format such as a geoTIFF would be a good model to follow.  At a minimum, we must be able to retrieve latitude, longitude, and water quality parameters for a specific point from the imagery.
	The data deliverable will include raw imagery, derived products, and FGDC-compliant metadata.
2.	Approximate cost information
	Costs can be estimated on a per area basis or on a per scenario basis.
3.	Approximate data turn-around time
	Water quality data products are desired within 24 hours of collection.
4.	Operational considerations
	The feasibility of implementing an operational water quality monitoring program from these technologies will be explored.


CONCEPT PAPER FORMAT
Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis.  The concept paper should be no more than 10 pages in length, not counting Section 7, Supporting Documentation.

Section 1: Summary of Project/Company Expertise
Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, etc.  In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  

Section 2: Sensor Specifications
Describe the instrument that will be used to collect the data.  Provide specifications such as wavelength, field of view, spatial and spectral resolution.

Section 3: Data Algorithms 
Describe the methodology for estimating parameters (such as chlorophyll) from the raw data and the accuracy with which they can be estimated.  

Section 4: Data Products
Describe the format and approximate delivery time of data.

Section 5: Cost and Schedule Estimates
Provide cost estimates for data collection of this type of imagery and the breakdown of cost savings for areas of a certain size.  Provide estimate of time it requires to collect the data, process the data, and put the data in the clients' hands.  Also, discuss any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations that would need to be considered for operational data collection.

Section 6: Contact Information

Section 7: Supporting Documentation
Please provide any additional materials, such as SF-254's, sample imagery/data, cooperative research agreements, you may deem appropriate.

<DESC>1.1.1	At the following locations there are facilities that should be surveyed for asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) and lead-based paint (LBP).  Due to limited resources, identification of ACM and LBP in facilities has been accomplished on an as needed basis during engineering design reviews for demolition and renovation.  To date identification of ACMs in base facilities has been accomplished by an inspector from Base Civil Engineering (BCE) or by IDIQ contract with local inspectors and labs.  Since the surveys have been completed on a partial basis, it has not allowed for a very proactive approach to asbestos management and does not meet the requirements levied upon Base Civil Engineering in Air Force Instruction 32-1052 to identify and manage ACMs.

BASE	NO. OF BLDGS	TOTAL SF
Gila Bend AFAF, AZ	63	144,845
Barry M. Goldwater Range	15	12,355
Luke Air Force Base	4	79,684


1.2 	Scope.

1.2.1	This effort addresses a comprehensive physical asbestos identification survey for all listed buildings with an approximate total of 236,884 sq. ft. of floor space.  The purpose of the survey is to provide the base with a comprehensive management tool capable of quickly identifying potential asbestos and LBP hazards for facilities on base in either text or graphic formats.  This survey includes identification, sampling and analysis of suspect ACM and LBP from both the interior and exterior of these facilities.  ACM survey results will specify the type (for both friable and non-friable materials) and the quantity of ACMs in either linear or square feet, as appropriate, and specify existing health risks using the AHERA  protocol.  LBP samples are to be taken using the NITON X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer, with one (1) XRF shot to be taken of each suspect material.  Any inconclusive results are to be bulk sampled and analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption (FAA).  Lead-based paint materials are to be assessed by condition and accessibility factors.  The final survey results and system will provide a means of planning and programming repairs, renovations, demolition projects, and prioritizing health risks or responding to emergency conditions.  The survey will provide a consistent and effective program for managing ACM in accordance with the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) and the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requirements.  A database system of all readings will be developed using a Personal Computer (PC) tied into the USAF Civil Engineering computer system, to create an easily updateable database management system that is compatible with existing Luke computer hardware.  The system will allow for transfer of files and survey information between the base and headquarters and will include a workstation for the dedicated use of the Facilities and Asbestos Computerized Tracking System (ADAM*) management program .  The contractor will provide AutoCAD drawings documenting the findings of the survey.

Each unique homogeneous material at a building will be assigned a unique homogeneous area number and material abbreviation code specifying which building system it represents.  Samples will be linked to the materials using these codes.

4.	Track samples collected of homogeneous materials, including bulk asbestos, XRF lead and bulk lead.  Record date collected, sample location, laboratory ID, analysis method, results and units.  For asbestos samples, record up to three component layers of materials with different results for each material.  Link samples to the materials using homogeneous area numbers and building system codes.

5.	Import the lab results electronically, matching lab details with field details.

6.	Create, record, maintain, and report on abatement projects.  Record Project ID, name, start/stop dates, estimates, actual prices, and a project description.  Link the projects to surveyed homogeneous areas.  As materials are removed as a result of being included in projects, decrease the remaining quantity shown on query screens, summary tables, and reports.  Link each project to a contractor, consultant, and project manager.  For projects, record all associated waste manifests and air samples.  For each waste manifest record the number, date, who signed it, the hauler, and the final landfill destination, including the final weight ticket quantity.  Generate project close-out reports summarizing the scope of work using database specific material designators, air sample results, and listing of waste manifests.

7.	Establish and maintain notification database with name and addresses.  Be able to import notifyees from other sources.  Link notifyees to site and building records.  Generate building specific notifications for asbestos and lead paint.  Maintain history of all past annual and project related notifications.

8.	Link database records to one or more CAD drawings per building.  From the database screens, call up associated drawings.  Display highlighted appropriate drawing elements, depending on what level of database was selected.

The individual(s) must be made available on a full-time basis for the duration of the survey.  The individual(s) will be the teams point of contact with all building managers and other organizations on base. 

3.1.1.3  Some keys may need to be made available to the contractors team for access to certain buildings and mechanical rooms for the duration of the survey.  Contractor site personnel will be responsible for restoring occasional visible sampling locations in occupied areas, to near original condition. (i.e., offices, where samples cannot be taken in concealed locations.)  This will require small amounts of touch up painting for a number of sampling locations.  The CE paint shop must supply support for this requirement.  

3.1.2  Base Building Managers:  Assistance from the building managers in the designated facilities will be required during the actual survey to insure access to all buildings on a timely basis in accordance with the survey schedule.  This requirement necessitates an accurate, up to date list of names and phone numbers for these building managers will be needed for the kickoff meeting prior to the start of the survey.  This list is to be provided by the CE survey point of contact.  (Building managers need not plan to be present at the kickoff meeting.)

3.1.3  Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) and Military Public Health:  As a result of the public interest and concern for issues revolving around ACMs, Bioenvironmental and military public health could potentially be subjected to questions about the survey.  It will be critical that these offices understand all aspects of the survey.  In previous surveys all of the contractor personnel have been instructed to refer all questions to these offices since they cannot act as spokespersons for the Air Force.  Thirty days prior to bring the XRF gun on base, the BEE must be contacted and all literature and training certifications delivered for approval.

3.1.4  Base Security Police:  Contractor personnel will need access on base for the duration of the survey and for all associated meetings.  The contractors use of radio equipment on base must also be addressed.  When necessary base security police will provide information and assistance for access to secure and restricted access areas on base.  A complete listing of secure facilities and areas within facilities will be needed at the kick-off meeting.  A representative from the security police should plan to be present at the kickoff meeting to discuss access-related issues.

3.1.5  Communications Squadron:  The Communications Squadron must be advised of the contractor's use of radio equipment for the duration of the survey.  Information about the specific equipment and frequencies to be used will be provided at the kickoff meeting.  A representative from the Communications Squadron should plan to be present at the kickoff meeting to address these issues.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Joseph Bolmarcich, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7171
<DESC>NA Introduction: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) hereby issues this Request For Information (RFI) for the purpose of market research only. The attachments to this RFI provide information with respect to the Multi-Level Security (MLS) System. The attachments indicate specific information that the vendor shall submit for evaluation. The Government requests that no proprietary data be submitted to the Government in response to this notice. All vendors are cautioned that this Request For Information (RFI) is not an Invitation To Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not represent a commitment on behalf of the Government to issue a RFP or award a contract. The Government will not pay for any information provided in response to this RFI. Information provided in response to this RFI will not be used to exclude anyone from responding to a potential RFP if an acquisition is warranted. Moreover, information provided in response to this RFI will not be used during the course of evaluation with respect to the submission of a future proposal for any potential Government requirement. Background Information: Recent advances in information technology, coupled with the need for improved efficiency and performance, have led to many of the nation's infrastructures becoming increasingly automated and interconnected. These advances, while providing mission advantages, have also increased security risks. In addition, the environment in which these information systems may be used includes users with varying access levels and security clearances, based upon their individual functions, organizations, or countries of origin. Ensuring that rapid access to information is available to users in accordance with established security practices will be critical for successful mission completion and health of our information system architectures. To adequately protect and defend our systems and our information, a structured and dynamic multi-level security program is essential. The Program Executive Office C4I and Space (PEO C4I and Space) Code PMW 161 is the Navy Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Program Office assigned by SECNAVINST 5239.3 as the technical lead for INFOSEC within the Department of Navy (DON) and is responsible for developing, managing, and executing the DON's INFOSEC program. PMW 161 is interested in innovative and creative responses and ideas to focus its MSL/MLS program in a manner that will provide needed multi-level security environments to match fleet operational needs in near-term, tangible, and measurable ways. PMW 161 is seeking contractors, Government agencies, laboratories, universities, consortia, and other research and development organizations that are capable of designing, developing, integrating, demonstrating, and otherwise delivering capabilities in multi-level security and coalition interoperability. In the areas of Multi-Level Security (MLS), Multiple Single Level (MSL) security, and Coalition/Allied interoperability, PMW 161 is interested in the design, development, and integration of "multi-level" solutions, which allow collaboration from a single terminal/workstation across multiple security/sensitivity levels in a secure manner. Preferred solutions would enable collaboration across multiple security levels, and between United States, Coalition, and Allied Forces. Key MLS collaborative capabilities include the ability to access and disseminate information at varying security/sensitivity levels accommodating dynamic coalitions with effective and efficient information flow. All interested firms and agencies, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this announcement. The ideas and proposals submitted may involve areas other than those specifically identified herein. RFI Response Evaluation: The Government anticipates using non-Government personnel from Planning Systems Incorporated (Point of Contact: Mr. Charlie Hopkins, 619-944-2786, chopkins@plansys.com), Galois (Point of Contact: Mr. John Launchbury, Phone 503-526-3472, john@galois.com), and Booz Allen Hamilton (Point of Contact: Mr. Brian Dolan, 619-725-6581, dolan_brian@bah.com) to evaluate the responses to this RFI.  If any vendor responding to this RFI does not want to have any such non-Governmental personnel review that response, that response shall so state. As stated above, the Government requests that no proprietary data be submitted in response to this RFI.  If a vendor submits information marked with a ?proprietary data? restrictive legend, only Government personnel will review that proprietary data.  If upon reviewing that proprietary data the Government deems that that data warrants evaluation by non-Government personnel, the Government will request that the vendor enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the non-Government evaluators listed above to permit those non-Governmental evaluators to evaluate that proprietary data.  The Government does not have any requirements with respect to the content that should be included in the NDA.  The Government will not be a party to any such NDA as the NDA will be signed between each vendor and non-Government evaluator to ensure that proprietary information is not used or disclosed in an unauthorized manner.  A sample NDA is provided as an attachment for the convenience of vendors.  Any proprietary data furnished by a vendor in response to this RFI will not be furnished to any non-Governmental evaluators until such time as an NDA is executed between that vendor and those non-Governmental evaluators. Any interested party shall provide a response to SPAWAR no later than 16 May 2003, 4:30 PM Pacific Time. Any interested party shall submit a response electronically to Contract Specialist Joe Bolmarcich at joe.bolmarcich@navy.mil. The format for the response is provided in the applicable attachments. Interested parties shall respond to all the questions in each attachment and shall strictly adhere to the format/requirements of each attachment. ANY and ALL questions with respect to this RFI shall be directed to Contract Specialist Joe Bolmarcich at the e-mail address indicated above or phone number 619-524-7171. Industry Day: SPAWAR anticipates conducting an ?Industry Day? on 2 April 2003 so that interested parties may meet with Government personnel so that: 1) the Government can provide interested parties with information about MLS and 2) the Government can answer questions about the contents of the RFI. The Government will not pay for any travel and/or administrative costs associated with an interested party?s attendance at ?Industry Day.? The event shall be held at the Booz Allen Hamilton facility located in San Diego, California. The decision to attend or not to attend will not have an impact on any potential, future evaluation of a proposal that may be submitted in response to a potential RFP. Moreover, the information provided by each interested party will not have an impact on any potential, future evaluation of a proposal that may be submitted in response to a potential RFP.

Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are working on the following technology.

For further information, CONTACT:  MARY CLAGUE, TELEPHONE (301) 975-4188 OR EMAIL MARY.CLAGUE@NIST.GOV, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Partnerships Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Stop 2200, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899. Fax:  301-869-2751.

THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION OR A GRANT.

NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  02-002PA

Title:  	Low Cost Portable Refreshable Tactile Graphic Display

Description:  	This technology relates primarily to reducing the total number of stimulus points needed by a refreshable tactile graphic display system, though the ratio of actuators to stimulus points can also be reduced for further cost saving.  The method is also expected to reduce the cost per actuator, compared to discrete piezoelectric actuators.


NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  02-013PA

Title:  	Integrated Refrigerant Expansion Valve

Description:  	This technology describes a refrigerant expansion valve in which flow restriction can be modulated.  The valve involves a fluid container, membrane and heater, and is produced using the types of manufacturing processes developed in the silicon processing industry.  By taking advantage of these processes, it will become possible to produce an expansion valve in large quantities with accurate dimensions and excellent reproducibility at a relatively small cost per unit.  By inexpensively producing a device with this functionality, it will become feasible to utilize them in small vapor compression systems, such as refrigerators and window style air conditioners, to improve the operational efficiency.  It will also be feasible to apply such a device on individual circuitry branches of large evaporators to evenly control refrigerant superheat at the outlets of all branches.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation under the FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The NAICS for this solicitation is 337214 with a small business size of 500 employees.  The solicitation document, incorporated provisions, and clauses are those in effect through FAC 12. The COR on this project for technical information is Mike Allen, 760-873-2405.  
Quotes must be received on response date by 4:30pm  .........................................................
*CLIN01a* 3 EA DISPATCH CONSOLE FURNITURE UNITS or 
*CLIN01b* 4 EA DISPATCH CONSOLE FURNITURE UNITS.  
Only one of the above line items will be awarded.  
Determination of which line item to be awarded will depend on the layout of the consoles being provided.  More than one quote/layout may be submitted.  
*OPTIONAL ITEM02* Static dissipative laminate on keyboard countertop, grounded FOR EACH DISPATCH CONSOLE ordered. .....................................................
The intent of these specifications is to purchase Dispatch Console Furniture for use by the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Inyo National Forest, Dispatch Center, Bishop, California.  An Adobe Acrobat Drawing is available as a separate .PDF document. 
OVERVIEW  
The Dispatch Section is staffed 12 hours per day, 7 days a week with a minimum staff of two (2) personnel on duty during each shift, with the capability of up to six (6) personnel on duty at one time.  Vendor to provide console furniture that has two independently adjustable countertops to house:  
1)  CAD, Radio and telephone monitors and related hardware; and 
2)  Computer keyboards and dispatcher work surface.  
Consoles must allow dispatchers to work in a sitting or standing position and must have ample adjustments to meet or exceed anticipated federal ergonomic requirements.  The electronic hardware within the furniture must be secured.  Electrical wiring must be concealed to prevent accidental contact or disconnection.
ERGONOMICS
While ergonomic standards have not yet been formally established, the following specifications are considered to conform to proposed requirements:  The console furniture in this specification must provide independent vertical adjustment of both the countertop containing the monitors and the countertop containing keyboards and wiring surface.  Vertical adjustment is to the extent that a dispatcher can comfortably operate equipment from any position ranging from fully seated to fully standing.  Monitors are arranged within easy and adjustable reach of dispatchers.  Electronic hardware shall be able to be rebooted without a person having to crawl under the console to access control switches.
WIRING REQUIREMENTS
Electronic components within the consoles must be secured.  The console furniture must provide the ability to securely house internal electronics or CPUs.  CPUs should be housed within cabinets integral to the console furniture.
Electrical and communications wiring should be concealed and secured to the greatest extent possible to prevent accidental contact with wiring or accidental disconnection.  It is not deemed acceptable to have coiled wiring on the floor to accommodate the vertical adjustment of countertops, as it can become entangled with other items or come in accidental contact with employees.
SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS
All new dispatching facilities must meet seismic requirements.  Consoles must be capable of being anchored to the floor.  Electronic components within the consoles, particularly CPUs, must also be secured. Installations where CPUs are free-standing on top of the console countertops pose a potential danger for the employees in the event of a seismic emergency.  Other installations where CPUs are placed unsecured on the floor of the dispatch office provide no seismic integrity and also expose unsightly and unsafe wiring.  In order to meet seismic requirements, CPUs should be housed within cabinets integral to the console furniture.
VENDOR?S INFORMATION
Vendors will provide photographs and detailed CAD or technical drawings of the Dispatch Consoles and the proposed layout when submitting their quote.
