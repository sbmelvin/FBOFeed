<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to acquire professional services on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 from Gerard Guthrie, Maryland, for TOXNET system maintenance support services.  The period of performance is for one (1) year with four one-year option periods.

The primary goal of the proposed work is to provide support for the analysis of methods used in the conversion of files from external data sources to the mainframe TOXLINE format and to recreate these processes for the new UNIX environment.

Based on his experience with and knowledge of the TOXLINE legacy conversion processes and data formats, Mr. Guthrie shall provide support for the continuing development of the successors to the legacy mainframe computer programs, including the transition of updates to various toxicology and environmental health databases in TOXLINE.  Mr. Guthrie will also be required to prepare and deliver training sessions for Government personnel covering these procedures and to work on new procedures for providing TOXLINE data to third party providers.

In addition, Mr. Guthrie shall provide assistance in the configuration and monitoring support of TOXNET and related Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) systems across the three sites.

Specifically, Mr. Guthrie shall: 1) develop products in support of quarterly meetings of the Scientific Review Panel (SRP); 2) perform database updates and conversion program changes to various toxicology databases within the TOXNET and other SIS systems; 3) provide on-going interpretation of imported data formats and processing problems; 4) develop and maintain a process flow or description of the steps involved in the data update processes for the databases; 5) give SIS staff training for TOXLINE operations procedures and requirements for TOXLINE data conversion; 6) conduct special research assignments covering legacy topics, and other topics such a analyzing the data flow from original sources through conversion and retrieval for TOXLINE files or related projects as assigned by the Technical Program Manager; 7) provide maintenance support and quality assurance evaluations of TOXNET processes and data; and 8) support systems configuration and enhancement at the three SIS computer sites.

Mr. Guthrie is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  He is the only technically experienced person who has worked with both the historical problems and requirements of TOXNET/TOXLINE data conversion and with the current details of the processes by which data become available to NLM, are transferred to SIS, and are then transformed into formats appropriate for SIS Internet retrieval.  He is the only person with knowledge of the techniques that have evolved across four major restructuring of SIS computer operations.  He is the only person familiar with the TOXLINE file formats used from 5 – 20 years ago.  His experience and knowledge are unique.  As such, he is the only person who is capable of translating the file formats and providing the services above.

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).
 
This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capability statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capability statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated for knowledge of the TOXLINE file formats employed in the last 5 – 20 years by SIS.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-241/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed Stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area, which is the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

Firms having the capabilities to perform the services described in this announcement are invited to respond by submitting six (6) complete copies of the entire Stage I submittal including the portfolios, SF330 (Information just of the Design firm), and a letter of interest identifying this announcement by solicitation number arriving at the designated location no later than October 8, 2004 by 2:00 p.m. (Central Time).

If applicable, each SF330 submitted should make the following certification as the last entry in Block 30: “I hereby certify the firm (or joint firm) and consultants listed for this project meet the geographic locations stated in the FBO announcement for this solicitation.”  A follow-up listing of firms to be selected for Stage II and interviews will appear as a modification to this synopsis posting.  All other non-selected A/E firms and consultants interested in participating on the design team should submit a one page letter of interest only, which will be forwarded on to the short-listed firms. FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. Award of this contract is contingent upon receipt of design funds and successful negotiation of a reasonable fee.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A-E firms will not be reimbursed for expenses or efforts under Stage I and/ or Stage II submissions.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and a Rheometer. The modulated DSC is needed for its ability to enhance resolution and baseline flatness. The item must have fully modulated capabilities to apply sinusoidal temperature waves to the sample with amplitude of +/- 0.01 to 3 degrees C, and a frequency period from 10 to 200 seconds. Products that use rapid step isothermal techniques are not acceptable. The instrument must be designed such that the sample and reference are measured in the same furnace on separate stages. The instrument shall have the ability to use area temperature detectors directly beneath the sample and reference positions and not use platinum resistance thermometers or thermopiles. The modulated DSC shall have the capability to remove traces of moisture in the gases. See attached statement of work (SOW). The rheometer is essential in supporting analysis of polymer melts and certain viscous formulations of RCC and tile repair. The rheometer shall have a separate, isolated direct current, servo-actuator (motor) and auto ranging Force-Rebalance transducer design, which will enable a pure, inertial-free analysis. The instrument shall have the ability to measure data samples that allow the user to select sampling rates up to 100 data points per second. The rheometer shall have an integral software oscilloscope function that displays true, real-time display of commanded and resultant waveforms during dynamic testing.  The torque measurement transducer must be capable of measuring torque from 0.02 to 2,000 g-cm with a minimum resolution of at least 1e-4 g-cm. See attached statement of work (SOW). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from TA Instruments. TA Instruments offers both items in a configuration that complies with the unique requirements that NASA/JSC is looking to purchase. Based on market research, there are no other firms able to comply with the specification. The authority for this action is 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on September 16, 2004.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole source contract to Arnold & Porter LLP of Washington, D.C. pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This procurement is for the purchase of the legal services and business advice in support of the Agency's effort to create a venture capital fund similar in concept to the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) In-Q-Tel.  NASA's fund is hereby referred to as "The Mercury Fund".  The services provided under this contract will include unique legal, taxation, and operational advisory services.	 The goal of  The Mercury Fund will be to invest in tandem with established private sector venture capital funds to sponsor innovative, multi-use technologies to help NASA achieve its mission and to better position these technologies for future multiple and/or commercial uses.  More specifically, the intent of this Fund will be to invest in young, privately held companies working in the following areas:  nanotechnology, robotics, intelligent systems and high-speed networking and communication. Arnold & Porter is in a unique position to fully meet NASA's requirements in an expeditious manner.  Members of the Arnold & Palmer LLP team have worked extensively with the CIA in creating and operating a government backed venture capital as an innovative tool to serving the CIA's technology development needs.  Arnold & Porter LLP has been an integral part to solving unique taxation and intellectual property issues for In-Q-Tel, as well as having been intimately involved in establishing legal, taxation, and operational precendents that will be used as a template for the creation and operation of the Mercury Fund. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the NASA's GSFC office and contact listed below.  See Note 12. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.	 An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA specific note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

The study of pregnant women, was conducted bu Dr.  Hopenhayn, Principal Investigator to examine adverse effects of arsenic exposure from drinking water in Chile in two cities with differing water arsenic levels, Antofagasta (40 uglL) and Valparaiso (>5 ug/L).  The University is currently in possession of the data and has been conducting all the  related analyses related to anemia during pregnancy. SE and As combined effects, and exposure to arsenic from drinking water.  To conduct another study to obtain new urinary and blood samples for laboratory analysis would require considerable more resources than to analyze the existing samples that   Dr. Hopenhayn has in storage.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requiring by submitting documentation, to Thomas Martinez at the office identified above, by fax (703)308-2358  or by e-mail (Thomas.Martinez@epa.gov) , which establishes that their specifications meet EPA?s requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends on entering into a sole source contract with John Hopkins University, 1101 E. 33rd Street, Baltimore, MD 21218, for the development of molecular assays for assessing HIV-1 GAG.  The CCR, HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch (HAMB) conducts laboratory and clinical research in AIDS, AIDS-related malignancies, and viral-induced tumors.  The aim of the HAMB is to develop novel therapies for these diseases based on an understanding of their pathogenesis.  Clinical research is currently directed toward HIV infection in both children and adults as well as AIDS-related malignancies.  Other areas of focus include antiagiogenesis approaches for Kaposi's sarcoma; immunologic and vaccine approach for HIV infection; and novel anti-HIV therapies; regulation of HIV infection, the effects of redox stress on HIV protease, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpersvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), and the regulation of splicing in human papilloma viruss.  The HIV & AIDS Malignancy Branch of the NCI and John Hopkins University has collaborated over several years to recover and molecularly characterize HIV-1 in plasm and latent reservoirs in HAART-treated children who have undetectable viral loads.  John Hopkin's researchers will conduct studies of the HIV-1 pol and env regions in the vaccine and develop assays to establish the evolutionary features of HIV-1 GAG in the setting of suppressive HAART.

DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Hamdo Katica, General Manager, BH Telecom, Obala Kulina bana 8, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Phone: +387 33 232 651, Fax: +387 33 221 111
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the deployment of a Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) network in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

This project would require the mobilization of funding for the deployment of a national WiFi network throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The implementation of this network would provide the majority of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a low-cost option to telecommunications and Internet Protocol applications.  In addition, the WiFi network would expand coverage to remote and disconnected rural regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while offering the added benefit of broadband.  

Three state-owned telecom operators currently dominate the telecom sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina: BH Telecom, Telecom Srpske, and HPT Mostar.  All three companies provide fixed and mobile telecom services to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  BH Telecom is the largest of the three operators.  BH Telecom was created from the former company PTT at the beginning of the Bosnian conflict.  BH Telecom maintains telecommunications nodes in seven cities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of which are connected via optical cables and mobile systems.

A major challenge that BH Telecom faces is building out mobile and fixed wireless infrastructure in rural and/or mountainous parts of the country, as well as in non-contiguous regions and republics.  These republics pertain to the two multi-ethnic constituent entities that exist within the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS).  Given the low population density, distance, and low market share, it is difficult for BH Telecom to justify investment in Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) infrastructure in these regions.  At the same time, there is an increasing demand for broadband services from fixed-line, Internet Service Provider, and GSM customers, which BH Telecom is currently unable to fulfill.  WiFi technology, which is relatively cheap to deploy and allows for transmission speeds faster than that of GSM, is an economical solution to both problems.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $230,850 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, OCTOBER 11, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Mammary Biology and Tumorigenesis Laboratory (MBTL) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Icoria, Inc., 108 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, for the continued processing of mouse mammary gland samples.  The MBTL conducts research on development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis in the mammary gland. The goal is to utilize multidisciplinary approaches encompassing areas such as endocrinology, molecular genetics, stem cell biology, growth factors, oncogenes, cell signaling, and animal model systems to understand the pathobiology of breast cancer.  MBTL’ s research is attempting to identify patterns of RNA expression that are hallmarks of the different stages of mammary development. These active genes will then be explored for their involvement in the tumorigenic process when misregulated and as potential targets for prevention and therapy.  Icoria has previously generated microarry data sets on transgenic mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis for the MBTL. Icoria is the only vendor known to CCR who can process these samples without the introduction of new variables and maintain comparability across all data sets without additional mathematical manipulation that could distort gene expression patterns.  Icoria uses a unique two color labeling system which is especially suited for the needs of this research.  This service is considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 10, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

In addition they are procuring an animal cradle with a integrated heating facility for the 7T animal MRI.  LFMI is a laboratory dedicated to developing ultra-high field MRI techniques for assessing brain function in vivo.  These phased-array coils will be used for high resolution imaging of the rodent brain. Geometric constraints require that the phase-array coils provide complete coverage of the rat brain (~ 3 x 3 x 3 cm3 volume). Because both the 7T/31 as well as the 11.7T/31 cm MRI scanners have 4-channel receivers, each phased-array set must be composed of 4 RF coils. These coils must be independent of each other, while still providing for complete coverage of the rat brain.  The cradle is fully compatible with the phased-array coils and preamplifiers so that the device is properly secured and well positioned over the animals head. In addition, the animal cradle should be equipped with an integrated heating facility to keep animals at normal body temperature during MRI experiments. This order is being processed in the aggregate for an already developed commercially produced product.  Offerors to develop this product or only supply some of the items will not be considered. RAPID Biomedical GmbH is the only source known to the NINDS end user that is capable of providing 4-channel phased-array coils that meets the above required specification. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.

The Biophysics Section investigates various ways of imaging tumors with regards to the measurement of vital process, in development of novel treatment strategies for cancer patients.  The BS is working on the ability to non-invasively measure the complete oxygen map of a tumor and its surrounding normal tissue.  The Biophysics Section’s research on this project has come to a point where  continuing  this research requires a more powerful homogeneous magnet and gradient system to advance their imaging achievements.  The new resistive dipole magnet has a stability of +/-3 ppm and an integrated gradient coil system strength of 150 mT/m.  Current research has been done on a Resonance Research GMW model 5451 50 mT air core resistive unit with integrated shielded gradient coils (50mT/m).  The entire unit was operated with software developed by the RBB branch explicitly for these components.  The Resonance Research Inc. dipole magnet and integrated gradient coil are compatible with the existing equipment and the only system known to the researcher that would not be disruptive to his experiments or the integrity of the experiments.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) seeks to enter into a 5 year, Firm Fixed price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) based on FAR Part 12 Commercial procedures, with coverage via a Virtual Prime Vendor arrangement for insulation materials and installation hardware components to support the US Navy and commercial shipyards.  This is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition, with an expected issue date on or about 4 October 2004. The contract will have a one-year base period followed by four one-year option periods. The primary goal is to improve customer support at the user level through the use of the Virtual Prime Vendor (VPV) concept. The Vendor(s) will be required to support the identified vessels at both military and commercial shipyards within specified geographical locations. The VPV should be capable of providing integrated logistics support for insulation material and installation hardware within these locations.  The following geographic locations are applicable to this effort:  Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Newport News Naval Shipyard, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Additional shipyards may be added by amendment after solicitation or by modification after award.  Prime Vendor arrangements will be accomplished in phases, with Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Newport News Naval Shipyard being considered as the first phase. Insulation and hardware components may include and are not limited to items, Fibrious Adhesive, Cement, Fiberglass Cloth, Lagging Hooks, Insulation Blanket, Board Glass, Sail or Wiring Lacing Hooks, Washers, Calcium Silicate (Kaylo), Spray Shield Material, and Brass Wire, in support of Navy vessels, which are managed by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), General Services Administration (GSA) and Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP), as well as code and part numbered items.  The Prime Vendor Contractor will be asked to provide material within time definite delivery (TDD) timeframes of 2-10 days based upon Issue Priority Group (IPG).  The Vendor must be capable of achieving a 98% on demand issue rate, have the ability to forecast the customer’s future needs and develop inventories or business relationship to meet such needs. The Vendor will be required to provide total end item support.  This includes spare parts, technical support (local Customer Service Representative available 24 hours / 7 days a week), supply support, surge support and other actions that the customer requests to both the US Navy and Commercial shipyards listed in the geographic locations listed above.  It is expected that one Prime Vendor cover an entire location, each additional location will be added to the contract without resolicitation.  Contract award for each location will be based on the evaluation of the Vendor’s proposal.  A “Market Basket” population of 203 items has been identified for the initial sites, which are Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Newport News Shipbuilding.  Interested parties should contact Mrs. D’Juana Cole at 614-692-5697 or via e-mail at DJuana.Cole@dla.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lincoln Technologies, Inc. of  Wellesley, Hills, MA 02481.  Lincoln Technologies has participated in a multi-year collaboration with the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that has resulted in Lincoln’s creation of WebDVDME. Lincoln will collaborate further with the FDA to test and deploy WebDVDME as a tool for assisting safety evaluators and epidemiologists in both CDER and CBER.  Data mining is a technique for extracting meaningful, organized information from large complex databases. There has been increasing interest in the use of data mining technology to enhance the FDA’s ability to monitor the safety products after they have been approved for use.  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) received approximately 100,000 adverse event reports annually. Currently, no standard statistical tools are in place to detect signals among these reports. The purpose of this project is to support an evaluation by CDRH of the potential value of data mining in the device setting.  This tool may optimize evaluation resources and enhance CDRH’s ability to identify device-related safety concerns.  The use of enhanced data mining techniques may improve upon CDRH’s current ability to identify adverse event patterns in post-market safety databases. This evaluation will include getting the WebVDME environment set up and working on a CDRH server, training and user support, MAUDE data preparation and loading, collaborative experimentation in tuning the application and the data and applying it to some test problems.  The tasks to be accomplished include: WebVDME software installation; system setup; initial administration; training; pone support; MAUDE data preparation for data mining; database mapping and load script development; WebVDME data mining configuration setup; collaboration in methodology assessment and improvement; initial data mining runs; assessment of different data mining analysis strategies; and Project Management.  Sources with the capability of performing these services must submit descriptive literature which fully demonstrates their capabilities. The FDA will review and consider these submissions in making its award decision. The award will be made as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).   An award will be made on or after 9/15/04. Email inquiries should be sent to Mary.Farrell@FDA.GOV.

(2)  The requirement to perform CD4/CD8 CPT and T & B cell panels-tetra color as they are provided under an existing BPA.  (3)  Delete the Immunotrol (high/low for 2 instruments) as it is not a test requirement.

Unique requirements for service are that CPT services shall be performed on the Coulter Epics XL-MCL with Flow Centre as this system is currently under contract at the ECHCS.  All Flow Cytometry CPT Services are required to be performed on a single unit as it is not economically or administratively feasible to manage two separate contracts and equipment to perform the same function as a single unit. (5)  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>This announcement is to issue clarifications to the announcement issued under RFP 552-59-04.  The following is a list of questions asked by potential offerors, followed by the answer to each question:  1.)  Q - There is a line in the RFP which states: “Firms unwilling, unable or not possessing qualifications (in house) to perform work involving the detection of hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos, lead, PCBs etc.) and the subsequent design for its abatement and/or removal will not be considered for this contract.”  Does this mean the architectural or engineering firm would be required to handle this in house without including a firm on the team that specializes in hazardous material identification and abatement?  A – This requirement is being changed to remove the “in house” requirement.  The above statement shall now read: “Firms unwilling, unable or not possessing qualifications to perform work involving the detection of hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos, lead, PCBs etc.) and the subsequent design for its abatement and/or removal will not be considered for this contract.  Firms are required to include in their design team, subcontractors or personnel that perform as part of their regular business activities surveying and detection for hazardous materials and the subsequent design and removal oversight for all abatement activities."  2.)  Q - Should architectural submittals include teaming with an engineering firm or will the two disciplines be considered separately and then paired for the projects?  A – Projects/Task Orders that are primarily architectural will be awarded to the architectural firm that receives the overall architectural award.  The architectural firm will be responsible for providing qualified engineering staff for any incidental engineering required.  3.)   Q - If architectural submittals should include engineering firms, can the architect propose to work with one engineering firm for Cincinnati VA projects and another for Dayton and Chillicothe projects?  A – Yes.  4.)   Q - Will only one firm/team be selected for all the mentioned projects?  Will there be a shortlist and interview process?  A – One Architectural firm will be selected for all of the architectural projects over $50,000 at the Cincinnati, Dayton, and Chillicothe VA Medical Centers, and one Engineering firm will be selected for all of the engineering projects over $50,000 at the Cincinnati, Dayton, and Chillicothe VA Medical Centers.  Yes, there will be a shortlist and interview process.  5.)  Q - Should the Engineering firm have some architectural capabilities or an architectural teaming member; and, likewise, should the Architectural firm have engineering capabilities or an engineering teaming member?   A – See question and answer number 2.  6.)  Q - Will the Engineering firm awarded the work perform the engineering related designs for the Architectural firm awarded the work?  A – That is not the intent, but it is not prohibited.  If the Engineering firm awarded the work wishes to subcontract to the Architectural firm, the VA will not prohibit it.  See question and answer number 2.  7.)  Q - Should the Engineering firm awarded the work have ALL the various engineering disciplines that may be needed during the course of the contract, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical, structural, plumbing, value engineering?  A – Yes.  Firms with all in-house capabilities will be rated higher than those without in-house capabilities.  8.)  Q - Should both the Engineering and Architectural firms awarded the work, have hazardous material specialists IN HOUSE as stated? Can this be a teaming member, i.e. a sub-consultant?   A – See question and answer number 1.  9.)  Q - Does the VA require or expect the awarded firms to have MBE or WBE participants on their team? If so, what percentage of participation?  A – A subcontracting plan will be required of any large business prior to award of a contract under this solicitation.  That plan will not be a part of the evaluation process, as those goals are not yet known. Please keep in mind that subcontracting does not necessarily mean subcontracting of the actual work.  It might also involve where you buy your office supplies, where you have photocopying performed, or other overhead-related items.  10.)  Q - In the description of services [information omitted], it is noted that environmental consulting and abatement must be "in house". This is typically a standalone service provided by consultants. We have worked with such an environmental firm on most of our Federal projects with excellent results. Is it acceptable to submit with a consultant rather than in-house if we can show a successful past performance using that consultant?   A – Yes.  See question and answer number 1.

<CONTACT>ROBERT JUST TEL: 812-854-5197
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for multi-purpose long-range programmable 40MM air-bursting ammunition that can be safely employed from a shoulder fired grenade launcher.  Other salient characteristics that are sought are: (1) Warhead - High Explosive Dual Purpose charge able to defeat both dismounted enemy soldiers and lightly armored vehicles; with a projectile mass of approximately 250 grams; (2) Fusing - Must be able to program the round to detonate in three modes: (A) Air-Burst Mode for enemy troops in open or defilade, (B) Impact Mode for light to medium armored vehicles and barriers, and (C) Delay Mode for firing through windows or other light barriers.  The round sought would be programmable for these three modes prior to firing or in the act of firing.  The programming would be effective to the maximum range of the round.  Default mode must be impact.  The fuse will!  also have an inherent Self Destruct Mode with a factory-set time delay that will function if the warhead fails to detonate in the three programmable modes. (3) Extended Range:  A range increase is sought from the current 400 meters to an objective range of approximately 600 meters, implying that muzzle velocity needs to be increased from current 77 meters per second to approximately 100 meters per second.  This will also reduce time of flight, and flatten the trajectory.  (4) Environmental Performance:  The round sought must operate in all Special Operations Forces environments to include submersion in to 66 feet in seawater.  Any responses to this notice should include the following: company name, brief description of company/capabilities, experience areas, history.  Respondents are requested to provide pricing and availability information for the following quantities: 100-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-20,000, 20,001-50,000 and over 50,000 +.  A respondent to this market survey mu! st have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture the 40mm ammunition.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate the ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  Interested companies who feel they possess the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the Government the following information; point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address, duns number, cage code and/or tax ID number, as well as size category (large/small disadvantaged, etc) a brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and existing safety approvals.  Also provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.  If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subc! ontractors must meet these criteria.  Please provide this information by no later than 22 September 2004 to the technical Points Of Contact (POC) Mr. Bobby Just and Mr. Phillip McMillen.  Mr. Just may be reached via e-mail at: Robert.Just@navy.mil, via facsimile at (812) 854-4405, or via phone at (812) 854-5197.  Mr. McMillen may be reached via e-mail at: Phillip.McMillen@navy.mil, or via phone at 812-854-3431.

It should be noted that during the evaluation of all information submitted, the government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as advisors to the Government evaluators. This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is interested in soliciting capability statements from qualified small business offerors for a possible small business set aside program.  The program being considered is to establish a data coordinating center (DCC) to develop and maintain a registry of patients with Marfan Syndrome and other connective tissue disorders receiving treatment for aortic aneurysm, heart failure and other cardiovascular complications.   The DCC will recruit 5 regional clinical centers which will collect and transmit to the DCC data, blood and tissue specimens on patients referred for treatment due to Marfan-related or other genetically-triggered cardiovascular complications.  The DCC  will collect and analyze clinical and laboratory data from RCCs on patients receiving treatment for aortic dilatation, aortic insufficiency, heart failure, or aortic valve repair.  The registry will provide data about the RCCs  and patient-care providers, treatment and patient characteristics, and outcomes in the hospital and in follow-up to researchers inside and outside the registry who are interested in advancing the fundamental understanding of aortic aneurysms or management of connective tissue disorder afflicted patients.  An important capacity of the registry will be to collect family pedigrees and develop screening protocols for extended families.  The registry will collect information on extra-cardiac complications of connective tissue disorders as well.  It is estimated that 300 Marfan  patients receive valvular surgery each year and that many more patients are being followed for aortic root disease and heart failure.  The expected capacity for collection of new patient data and specimens is 1,000/year for a period of 4 years.  Specifically, the DCC will: a) develop study protocols to collect data, blood and tissue samples, study policies, a manual of operations and study forms and informed consent documents in collaboration with a steering committee and the NHLBI, b) collect, format and store data, c) provide statistical analysis of the data and develop necessary software for this analysis, d) establish methods and procedures for tissue collection and storage, and e) facilitate interaction among the participating centers and provide administrative and logistical support for publication and dissemination of findings.  At a minimum, prospective offerors must document capabilities in the following areas which would evidence the potential to successfully complete the work of the registry:  1) Experience and adequacy of time commitment of the professional, technical and administrative staff, as well as any proposed consultants, to collect, store, process and analyze patient data and tissue samples; experience in developing manuals of operations for the collection of data from clinical sites or patient registries; and monitoring quality, completeness and timeliness of submissions of data and specimens from multiple sites.  2) Experience in diagnosis and treatment of aortic aneurysmal disease and its complications; experience in surgical procedures for aortic root disease and evaluation of outcomes; experience in family genetics, molecular biology, imaging and in assessing quality of life and economic impact of medical costs and lost wages. Experience in assessing the adequacy of medical facilities and support teams that serve patients and in patient selection criteria and its impact on reducing adverse events.  3) Experience in developing plans for analyzing large numbers of clinical measures.  4) Experience in developing statistical designs for analysis of data.  5) Facilities available for receiving, processing, storing, and retrieving medical data and specimens accurately and efficiently, including any equipment to automate the processing of data forms.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the above address.  Three copies of the capabilities statement must be received at this address fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this Notice.  When submitting this information, please reference Sources Sought Notice No. SS-NHLBI-HV-05-09.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns.  The RFP will be available at the FedBizOpps Website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov and at the NHLBI Website: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  Interested organizations submitting a capability statement are required to identify their size status.

<DESC>Market survey for repair & installation of fire rated stairwell doors, frames, and hardware.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, is conducting a market survey to identify sources and to increase competition acquisition opportunities f or repair/installation/recertification of fire rated doors, frames, and hardware at Moncrief Army Community Hospital, Ft Jackson, SC.  This request is only a market survey, not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  It is for information o nly and is not a request for proposal (RFP) or announcement of a solicitation.   The purpose of this Sources Sought request is to obtain repair/installation/ recertification of fire rated doors, frames, and hardware at Moncrief Army Community Hospital, Ft Jackson, SC.  Metal fire rated doors in stairwells throughout the hospital requir e repair, adjustment, and hardware replacement.  The existing frames also require straightening in place.  Upon completion of these repairs the doors, frames, and hardware must comply with applicable NFPA codes, and must be recertified with appropriate lab els affixed.  The hardware used must match the existing hospital standard to ensure compatibility with other existing fire doors.  Similar repairs are required to other non-rated doors (repair or replacement of doors and hardware, and straightening of fram es in place). Because the work is required in an operating hospital, workers must comply with infection control and safety requirements, including dressing out per operating room policies for repair and frame straightening operations in certain work areas.  Workers must  also be familiar with the requirements of the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) for work in operating hospitals.  In addition, a portion of the required repairs must occur after normal operating hours to minimize disrupt ion of hospital operations.  The overall timeframe for the work to be performed is limited due to JCAHO compliance requirements. Responses are required seven (7) days after publication of this notice.  Responses should be addressed to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 and will be directed to Mrs. Jacalyn Jenkins, (334) 441- 5598. Firms interested in being considered shall provide brief documentation of the companys capability to perform the work required, and past performance of similar work, specifically in reference to straightening in place of door frames, and on-site rec ertification of fire doors.  A list of completed projects with similar requirements shall be submitted, along with the project location, and the names and telephone numbers of customer points of contact.  The Government will not pay for any material provid ed in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of six months from the date of publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of Griffithsin, a Novel anti-HIV Protein with Potential Microbicidal, Therapeutic and/or Purification Utilities
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Targets Development Program (MTDP) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator to develop griffithsin (GRFT), a novel, potent anti-HIV protein isolated from an aqueous extract of the red algae Griffithsia. Sequence analysis reveals that it shares no significant homology with previously described proteins or to the transcription products of known nucleotide sequences. GRFT displayed potent antiviral activity against laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 with EC50 values ranging from 0.043 to 0.63 nM. In addition, GRFT aborted cell-to-cell fusion at similar concentrations. High concentrations (e.g. 783 nM) of GRFT were not found to be lethal to representative host cell types. GRFT blocks CD4-dependent gp120 binding and binds to viral coat glycoproteins but not to sCD4 or other tested proteins. GRFT has been recombinantly produced by expression of a corresponding DNA sequence in Escherichia coli.


Potential Areas if Application: Potential anti-HIV microbicide as a female-controlled virucidal gel, cream or suppository. Also potential therapeutic agent for systemic use similar to Fuzeon®. Griffithsin also has potential use in purifying biological fluids from HIV virions.


Main Advantages of the Technology: Uniquely potent activity against HIV. No toxicity displayed in host cells at highest tested concentrations. Has been produced recombinantly in E. coli.


Current State of Development: On-going X-ray crystallographic studies and in vitro evaluation against additional viruses. Continuing efforts on enhanced recombinant production yields.


Further R&D Required: In vivo efficacy, immunogenicity, toxicity, pharmacokinetic, ADME and large-scale production studies.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Molecular Targets Development Program (MTDP) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator to develop scytovirin, a new, 95 amino acid, anti-HIV protein isolated from aqueous extracts of the cultured cyanobacterium Scytonema varium. Scytovirin displayed potent anticytopathic activity against laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 (EC50 0.3 -22 nM). Scytovirin binds to the viral coat proteins gp120, gp160 and gp41 but not to the cellular receptor CD4 or other tested proteins. Scytovirin has been shown to bind to specific oligosaccharides on HIV Env glycoproteins with unique specificity. 


Potential Areas if Application: Potential anti-HIV microbicide as a female-controlled virucidal gel, cream or suppository. Also potential therapeutic agent for systemic use similar to Fuzeon®.


Main Advantages of the Technology: Uniquely binds to specific oligosaccharides on HIV envelope. No toxicity displayed in host cells at highest tested concentrations. Has been produced recombinantly in E. coli.


Current State of Development: On-going structural NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies as well as structural / thermodynamic binding studies to oligosaccharide molecular target. In vitro evaluation against additional viruses on-going.

<SUBJECT>--Engineering During Contruction at Arsenic Water Treatment Plants, Edwards Air Force Base, California
<DESC>1.	This is not an Announcement for Solicitation.  This is a Notice of Intent to contract with Innovative Technical Solutions Inc. (ITSI), an A-E firm in Walnut Creek, CA, on a Sole Source basis for a follow-on effort for Engineering During Constructi on (EDC) at the Arsenic Water Treatment Plants, Edwards AFB, CA for the following reasons. 2.	The A-E firm, Innovative Technical Solutions Inc. (ITSI), was selected in 2003 by the Air Force to design arsenic water treatment systems under an AFCEE A-E contract.  The firm successfully completed the design for the AFCEE in June of 2004.  The Sacram ento District was asked by its customer at Edwards AFB to negotiate and award a contract to implement the designs at two locations on base.  The construction contract will be awarded before 30 Sep 04 in order to meet the customer need to have the plants on  line by 1 Jan 2006 to meet regulatory requirements.  One essential feature of providing contract administration support services to the customer is the ability to continue working with the designer during construction.  The A-E firm is needed to answer qu estions on the design, attend progress meetings, provide submittal reviews and other engineering services during construction.  Since ITSI designed the project they are considered the only source that can provide the EDC services.  They are intimately fami liar with the design for this treatment system, they have experience in design of arsenic treatment systems using activated alumina media, knowledge of federal and state drinking water regulations, they have worked at Edwards on this and other projects wit h satisfactory to excellent past performance and they have an office in the local area.  This firm has responsibility for the design under the terms of their original contract, and unique knowledge of the original design.  This follow on contract is for co ntinued provision of these highly specialized A-E services and must be awarded within the next 30 days to ensure continued A-E support on this urgently needed project.  Award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost not ex pected to be recovered through competition and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agencys requirements.   3.	Any firm submitting a request for consideration as a result of the public announcement would need to meet the following criteria: a)	Have successfully completed a recent similar design for treatment of arsenic in drinking water. b)	Have recent experience working at Edwards AFB c)	Demonstrate knowledge of current and upcoming federal and state regulations for arsenic in drinking water and drinking water treatment systems. d)	Submittals should be limited to 8(a) small business firms. 4.	Submission Requirements:  Firms may provide qualification information for consideration in allowing the Contracting Officer to determine alternate sources for this specialized work.  The Contracting Officer has sole discretion in making a determination to solicit other sources based on the information provided as a result of this Notice of Intent.  Submittals, in the form of an SF 330 must discuss the qualifications of your firm in relation to each of the qualifications listed above.  Limit the submissio n of the SF 330 to not more than 20 pages.  A separate announcement and request for qualifications may be issued should this Notice of Intent result in responses that would reveal a more qualified source. 5.	The responses may be e-mailed, or mailed to U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, 1325 J Street, Eighth Floor (Barbara Marshall, CT-A), Sacramento, California 95814, (916) 557-5178, e-mail:  barbara.a.marshall@usace.army.mil .  Responses m ust be received by 3:30 P.M. Pacific Daylight Time, no later than 10 days after the date of this announcement.

Bullets fired at these ranges accumulate in earthen berms and contain heavy metals, including soluble and fragmented lead species.  Discharge of these projectiles into a collection earthen berm, the subsequent accumulation of lead, and release into the environment poises potential harm to human health and the environment.   Preventing lead discharge is important not only for regulatory reasons, but also because of the biological uptake potential and toxicity characteristics of lead.  

Air Combat Command has previously contracted a comprehensive investigation of SAFRs at 11 Air Force installations to characterize the storm water migration of lead and copper.  The primary concern of this investigation is to address the mobilization of lead and copper via storm water discharge to surface locations down gradient to the SAFR complex.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine, 1) the character and amounts of lead and copper that has migrated outside of the SAFR complex, 2) what are the regulatory implications of any amount of lead and copper accumulation, 3) the clean-up requirements, and 4) via laboratory and field research, assess methods to immobilize lead and copper ions, and prepare concept designs, specific to each bases needs, to prevent future releases of lead and copper to the surrounding SAR environment.

Item 4) of the prior contract includes batch tests on site-specific materials to determine the most efficacious and cost-effective stabilizing media.  Item 4) work also includes a study of the compatibilities of chemistry, soil types and local environment for the soil type at each SAFR.  Further, soil column tests are being performed on site-specific materials to provide site-specific data to aid in the selection of the best and most cost effective stabilizing media.  Stabilizing agents may include different phosphates, silicates, zeolites, nanocomposites, and granulated activated carbon.  Laboratory analysis includes, but is not limited to particle sizing, energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence/scanning electron microscopy (XRD/SEM) analysis for each of the materials and samples.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.

As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-04-R-RS07. 

1.  Responses are hereby provided to the following Technical and business questions:

Question 1) I would like confirmation that delivery and acceptance is at the NRL facility in Washington, DC (off of Rt. 295), and that any subsequent on site technical support, as stipulated in Section 12.0 (...Four on-site technical help and troubleshooting visits for a period of 1 year...) will also be at this site.  If not, what is the physical location for on-site visits?  Answer 1) See the synopsis/solicitation for delivery and acceptance location.  The requirements stated in Section 12.0 will take place at the same location.

Question 2)  a) The 35 pound load requirement for the pan/tilt units is much more than the maximum weight of the imaging systems, which are all under 7 lbs.  Is there a reason for this?  b) Would lighter, more compact units be acceptable?  c) Do you require the pan/tilt units to be weather resistant/ weather proof?  Answer 2) a)  Yes.  The Government anticipates using the required system in numerous ways with various possible configurations. b) See SOW Paragraph 8.1.2 for the applicable Government minimum requirements. Proposed solutions to Government requirements are the Offeror's responsibility.  c) See Answer 8 to Amendment 0002.

Question 3) a) In the NVUGIII specifications (Section 5.0), is the specification (5.1.2,8) of (...Focal Distance of at least 4.2 to 42mm...) critical to your application?  b) Would 5.1 to 51mm be acceptable provided it was compatible with the NV tube? c) Is there a reason that the word (...Aviation...) appears in the specification 
(5.1.1) for the NVUGIII tube?  Answer 3)  a) Yes.  b) See SOW Section 5.1.2(8) and Answer 6 to Amendment 0002 for the applicable Government minimum requirements.  c) Yes.  It represents the Government minimum requirements.

Question 4) Is there a specific device (Manufacturer and model) that you have in mind, or have used to generate the new specifications for the NVUGIII? Answer 4) Proposed solution to the Government requirements are the Offeror's responsibility.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to publish a list of questions received regarding this RFQ and the Government’s answers to those questions.

The due date and time for receipt of quotes by Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov is hereby extended to September 9, 2004 at no later than 4:00:00pm Eastern Time.

Questions and answers relating to this RFQ:

1) What are the minimum/maximum pressures needed in the environmental chamber?  Answer: Briefly, the essential requirement is to provide a pressure that is 2-5% greater than atmospheric in order that no ambient air enters the enclosure and the concentration of the gas mixture remain approximately constant.  Minimum pressure is not relevant.

2) Does the control system for the environmental chamber need to control the gas mixture ratio? Answer: The control system does NOT need to mix gases.

3) Will the fluid flow cell require a constant flow through it or simply a liquid cell which can be filled and drained? Answer: The fluid cell must be capable of constant flow as well as static filling.

4) Is the heating stage being used for liquid measurements? Answer: Yes, the heating stage is intended for simultaneous use with the fluid cell.  The two operations must be compatible.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO EXTEND THE PROPOSAL RESPONSE DATE TO 15 SEP 2004, 3:00PM EST AND TO REMOVE THE VERBAGE (CATERPILLAR OR CUMMINS) TO READ TWIN DIESEL ENGINES UNDER THE SPECIFICATIONS PERFORMANCE.  ALSO TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THE QU ESTIONS SUBMITTED BY POTENTIAL OFFERORS.  Q.  My question is in regards to the engine do you have load factors, hours per year utilization of the engines and how will the boats be utilized. A. Total operation approx. 250 hrs/yr.   Operated at cruising rpm approx. 2 hrs per operating day and operated at close to max. rpm approx. ½ hr. per operating day.  Q.  Please advise if any photos/information is available for the Patrol Boats currently in use at the Aberdeen proving Grounds. A.  One available via request to email jeanine.worthington@us.army.mil  Q.  Please confirm all the dimensions listed in the Combine Synopsis/Solicitation - Posted on Aug 24, 2004. The units FT/M are missing. A. 42' to 46' (feet) Q.  What range, cruise speed, and maximum speed are you looking for in your boat?  A.  150 Miles, 25 MPH, 30 MPH Q.  From the requirement for block heaters and heated defrost for windshields it appears that you expect cold weather operation, but is there anything else you can tell me about the operating requirements?  A.  Boats will be operated in sea conditions and air/water temperatures indicative of the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, primarily operation is in the Chesapeake Bay. Q.  Will the boats be used in offshore waters?  A.  No Q.  It is unclear how large a crew is anticipated although it does refer to 6 adult life jackets, and a two person (sleeps-2) berth forward. (Is this correct vice two berths forward?) A.  2-person crew and routinely carry passengers Q.  Please provide the ambient temperature of the water the vessel will be operating in and what is the minimal current flow around the vessel at full rated power. A.  Boats will be operated in sea conditions and air/water temperatures indicative of the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, primarily operating in the Chesapeake Bay w/desired minimum cruising speed of 25 mph and maximum speed of at least 30 mph. Q.  We need to know cruising speed and full out speed you are looking for. A.  Minimum cruising speed of 25 mph and max speed of at least 30 mph. Q.  What kind of certification do you want as far as passengers?  How many  passengers would you like the boat certified for? A.  The boats are piloted by Coast Guard certified captains (2-man crew). The boats must meet Coast Guard quality and safety requirements due to year round operation and the requirement to occasionally transport up to six(6)visitors.  Q.  Is there a requirement for operational range? A.     150 miles  Q.    Are there draft restrictions?  A.    No  Q.  Would the Army consider water jets for propulsion? A.  No Q.  What is the purpose for the keel cooler channels on the vessel.  A.  To reduce clogging of strainers and impellors in icing conditions and clogging of sea strainers when operating in shallow waters Q.  Is this for the generator or for the main engine cooling? A.  Both   Q.  We prefer to use raw water cooling for the main engines on a small platform.  Is this an acceptable method for cooling the main engines?  A.  Not preferred due to operations in shallow waters and icing conditions Q.    We prefer heavy walled aluminum half pipe for rub rails.  Will this be acceptable?   A.  Prefer heavy rubber rails. Q.  How many total persons will the boat accomodate?  Is it six per the number of life vests?  Is there a preference for the seating or arrangement to accomodate six persons?  A.  Seating for passengers is not necessary. The boats are primarily operated with a 2-man crew. Occasionally, up to six (6) visitors/passengers are transported for very short periods of time.
