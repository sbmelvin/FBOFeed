The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)

(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means- (1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and (2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee. (b) The Contractor shall- (1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements; (2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading; (3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract; (4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract; (5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and (6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).&nbsp;Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">SCOPE OF WORK Design Stage services and Construction Stage work are to be performed by the DB Contractor. Design Stage services include providing Design Concept and Design Development Phase services. Construction Stage work includes preparing construction documents and performing construction in conformance with the project requirements. The scope of services for the Design Stage will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents.

Most importantly, the Design-Build contractor shall have complete responsibility for design and construction of the facility, including timely delivery within the project budget.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the short list will NOT be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement. In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically after 11/4/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</span></p>

<DESC><p>The Buffalo District is currently preparing a solicitation to award&nbsp;approximately 4&nbsp;A&amp;E IDIQ contracts to support the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).&nbsp;Anticipated release date of the solicitation is 4 Nov 09.&nbsp; It is anticipated that each contract will have&nbsp;an ordering period of 5 years&nbsp;and a maximum ordering amount of $12M.&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus areas of GLRI are outlined below.&nbsp; The majority of the work will be performed within the boundaries of the Buffalo, Detroit, and Chicago Districts.&nbsp; It is anticipated that this will be a partial small business set aside with approximately 3 awards being made on the non set aside portion and one award on the small business set aside portion.&nbsp; <br /><strong><br />FOCUS AREAS</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. Toxic Substances and Areas of Concern</strong></p>
<p>While certain persistent toxic substances have been significantly reduced in the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem over the past 30 years, they continue to be present at levels above those considered safe for humans and wildlife, warranting fish consumption advisories in all five Lakes. Indigenous communities that still live off the land in the basin are particularly vulnerable to fish contamination. Continuing sources of persistent toxic substances include releases from contaminated bottom sediments; industrial and municipal point sources; nonpoint sources including atmospheric deposition, agricultural and urban runoff, and contaminated groundwater; and cycling of the chemicals within the Lakes. Efforts to restore the degraded conditions in the 30 US Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs) are underway, but much more needs to be done, including the remediation of an estimated 43 million cubic yards of legacy contaminated sediments which are a primary source of beneficial use impairments in virtually all the AOCs.</p>
<p>In addition to the well-known persistent toxics like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury and banned pesticides, there are chemicals of emerging concern that have been detected in the Great Lakes over the past several years which may pose threats to the health of the ecosystem, including many product related materials such as pharmaceuticals and personal care constituents for which there is very little environmental information. To protect human and ecosystem health against future threats, these substances must be better understood with respect to their potential hazards and routes of exposure, and effective regulatory and management responses must be deployed in a timely fashion.</p>
<p><strong>II. Invasive Species</strong></p>
<p>Progress toward restoring the Great Lakes has been significantly undermined by the effects of non-native invasive species. Over 180 non-native species now exist in the Great Lakes. The most invasive of these propagate and spread, ultimately degrading habitat, out-competing native species, and short-circuiting food webs. Prevention is the most cost-effective approach to dealing with organisms that have not arrived and could potentially threaten the lakes. New invasive species can be introduced into the Great Lakes region through various pathways, including: commercial shipping, canals and waterways, trade of live organisms, and activities of recreational and resource users. Once invasive species establish a foothold in the Great Lakes, they are virtually impossible to eradicate; however, invasive species still need to be controlled to maintain the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem. Advanced technology and innovative management practices can significantly reduce the cost of control.</p>
<p>Prevention and control efforts must be accelerated in order to prevent new introductions and to minimize the further spread of the organisms to inland lakes, the Mississippi River watershed, and beyond. Federal Agencies will need to work with their partners in state, tribal, and local governments, academic institutions, industry, and non-governmental organizations to:<br />1. Stop the introduction of new non-native invasive species into the Great Lakes through enhanced prevention programs. <br />2. Control and reduce the spread of invasives species already here through innovative technology and enhanced on-the-ground efforts. <br />3. Establish early detection and rapid response capabilities to deal with accidental introductions.</p>
<p><br /><strong>III. Nearshore Health and Nonpoint Source Pollution</strong></p>
<p>The nearshore waters of the Great Lakes are a primary source of drinking water, supplier of fish for both personal and commercial benefit, and a recreational outlet for millions of U.S. residents and visitors. Nearshore water quality has become degraded; however, as evidenced by eutrophication resulting from excessive nutrients; hazardous algal blooms; cladophora washing ashore to make unsightly, odiferous rotting mats on beaches; avian botulism; and beach closings. The environmental stressors causing these problems include excessive nutrient loadings from both point and nonpoint sources; bacteria and other pathogens responsible for outbreaks of botulism and beach closures; development and shoreline hardening which disrupt habitat and alter nutrient and contaminant runoff; and agricultural practices which increase nutrient and sediment loadings.</p>
<p>Many of the point sources of pollution to the Great Lakes have been controlled. Nonpoint sources are now the primary contributors of many pollutants to the Lakes and their tributaries. The complexity of the pollutants and their presence in soil, water and air make pollution abatement for nonpoint sources particularly difficult to address. Control strategies to date have failed to deliver the degree of stream and lake restoration necessary for the protection and maintenance of the Great Lakes.</p>
<p><br /><strong>IV. Habitat and Wildlife Protection and Restoration</strong></p>
<p>The health of Great Lakes habitats and wildlife depends upon the protection and restoration of ecosystems: the Great Lakes, the coastline, wetlands, rivers, and watersheds. Humans benefit from healthy ecosystems. Healthy Great Lakes, for example, provide us with clean drinking water; rare wildlife populate a variety of unique coastline habitats; wetlands help control floodwaters; rivers transport sediments, nutrients and organic materials throughout the watershed; forests provide oxygen while reducing erosion and sedimentation; and, upland habitats produce topsoil and habitats for pollinators and bio-control agents. Fully resilient ecosystems buffer the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>A multitude of threats affect the health of Great Lakes habitats and wildlife. Habitat destruction and degradation due to development; competition from invasive species; the alteration of natural lake level fluctuations and flow regimes from dams and other control structures; toxic compounds from urban development, poor land management practices and non-point sources; and, habitat fragmentation have impacted habitat and wildlife. This has led to an altered food web, a loss of biodiversity, and poorly functioning ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>V. Accountability, Monitoring, Evaluation, Communication, and Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>The Great Lakes Restoration effort requires additional oversight and coordination to succeed. There are gaps in baselines and in efforts to measure and monitor key indicators of ecosystem function, to evaluate restoration progress, and to provide the information decision-makers need. This information needs to be based on best available science, and compiled and communicated consistently to decision-makers to allow them to assess ecosystem conditions and to track restoration progress. Outreach and education is also needed to educate the public on the role they can play in protecting and restoring the Great Lakes - and why it is crucial to do so. Information must also flow both ways - the governments need to hear from the stakeholders about priorities most critical to them and factor in these comments as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes span many different government jurisdictions along with their regulatory agencies and authorities: two countries, eight U.S. states, two Canadian provinces, 83 U.S. counties, thousands of cities and towns, 33 U.S. tribal governments and over 60 recognized First Nations in Canada. Through the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty with Canada, the related Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and a host of other institutional arrangements, this region has a long history of governments at all levels working in partnership to protect and restore the Great Lakes. Federal coordination efforts have been greatly improved through efforts of the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force and its Regional Working Group. Binational efforts continue through the Binational Executive Committee which oversees the U.S. and Canada's actions to implement the provisions of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. These partnerships must continue and be further strengthened in order to address the complex issues faced by the Great Lakes. Effective public outreach and education strategies must be developed and implemented.</p>

<SUBJECT>Steam Sterilization Indicators (Biological)
<SOLNBR>R5-10-20-09-082-SSIB
<RESPDATE>111009
<CONTACT>Phyllis A Targett, Clinical Analyst, Phone 937-257-9075, Email phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<br />---------------<br />A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Steam Sterilization Indicators (Biological) for its 7 Army, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and US Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF's) in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan in the Heartland Region including institutional and operational healthcare settings. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I.
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. The seven facilities in the area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City Michigan.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) that is a supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is January 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Steam Sterilization Indicators (Biological), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $32,800.99. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Region MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: <br />1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Steam Sterilization Indicators - Biological products. A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Steam Sterilization Indicators - Biological for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes as follows: Biological Indicators in self-contained vials with response/read-out times of 3-hours (with controls and incubators). <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Sterilization Indicators product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<br />5. Please provide your 4 digit Prime Vendor Number, in response to this RFQ.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Sterilization Indicators, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. <br />8. Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Northeast Region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFQ. <br />9. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Steam Sterilization Indicators - Biological that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and meet current ANSO/AAMI standards for this product line. Provide literature to support this requirement in response to this RFQ.<br />10. Vendors must provide information on the reliability, safety, and performance characteristics of their products including the interpretation of the Indicators results, the endpoint-response maintenance during storage, the sterilization conditions that the Indicators will detect, the shelf life of the Indicators., and the storage requirements for the Indicators themselves before and after sterilization (ANSI/AAMI ST79P 2006) in response to this RFQ.<br />11. Vendors must provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all Indicators. Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions, in response to this RFQ.<br />12. Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free, in response to this RFQ.<br />13. Vendors MUST provide specific product information (brand, model, cost, etc.) of proprietary incubator used for Biological Indicators and Controls, in response to this RFQ.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will establish the "actual" clinical acceptability threshold following the clinical evaluation/data analysis. The CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00 in determining the actual acceptability threshold that will allow a reasonable source selection decision. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable and disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />Following the manufacturer's instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Steam Sterilization Indicators Biological will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department). Evaluators will evaluate the performance of the Biological Indicators/Controls used in pack loads during five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/performance criteria: <br /><br />1. The Biological Indicator/Control product packaging clearly indicates the type of Indicator for which type of steam sterilization process. <br />a. Biological Indicators are specific to the type of sterilization process to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments. <br />b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Biological Indicator by examining the product packaging. <br />2. After the sterilization process cycle is completed the initial Biological Indicator response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle. <br />a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments. <br />b. Before pack load is sterilized, the Biological Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer's guidelines/instructions. After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.<br />3. After complete incubation with Control, the Biological Indicator and Control response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (No Growth of Biological Indicator/Growth of Control). <br />a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments; Controls must clearly indicate growth of biological as a comparison. <br />b. After process cycle is completed and Biological Indicator has completed the required incubation period, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator/Control for ease of determining appropriate response (No Growth of Indicator/Growth of Control) indicating exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle. <br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?).<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $28,737.90. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Region MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: <br />1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Steam Sterilization Indicators - Chemical products. A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Steam Sterilization Indicators - Chemical for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes as follows: Class 1 Process Indicators - External Tape in &frac12;", 1" and 2" widths with and without dispensers for wrapped trays. Class 1 Process Indicators - External Tags for instrument pans. Class 2 Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick-type test). And Class 5 Integrator/Integrated Indicators. <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Sterilization Indicators product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<br />5. Please provide your 4 digit Prime Vendor Number, in response to this RFQ.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Sterilization Indicators, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. <br />8. Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) within the Northeast Region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFQ. <br />9. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Steam Sterilization Indicators - Chemical that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and meet current ANSO/AAMI standards for this product line. Provide literature to support this requirement in response to this RFQ.<br />10. Vendors must provide information on the reliability, safety, and performance characteristics of their products including the interpretation of the Indicators results, the endpoint-response maintenance during storage, the sterilization conditions that the Indicators will detect, the shelf life of the Indicators., and the storage requirements for the Indicators themselves before and after sterilization (ANSI/AAMI ST79P 2006) in response to this RFQ.<br />11. Vendors must provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all Indicators. Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions, in response to this RFQ.<br />12. Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free, in response to this RFQ.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will establish the "actual" clinical acceptability threshold following the clinical evaluation/data analysis. The CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00 in determining the actual acceptability threshold that will allow a reasonable source selection decision. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable and disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />Following the manufacturer's instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Class I Chemical Process Indicators and Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) using a Laparotomy Set (or similar instrument set) in an instrument pan, and using a Small Fragmentation Set (or similar instrument set) in a wrapped tray as sample test trays during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles. <br />Following the manufacturer's instructions/guidelines, Evaluation of Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) will take place at each MTF evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles (pack loads). <br />Evaluators will evaluate the performance of each type of Indicator in the Sample Set with the sample test trays and pack loads during the five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/ performance criteria: <br /><br />1. The Class I, II, and V Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator product packaging clearly <br />indicates the type of Indicator for which type of steam sterilization process. <br />a. Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicators are specific to the type of sterilization process to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments. <br />b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator by examining the product packaging. <br />2. The Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) are easy to attach to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan. <br />a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must attach easily and securely to determine the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments. <br />b. Evaluator will attach Class I External Pack Tape and Tag Indicators to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan and assess for ease/security of attachment. <br />3. After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the Class I Chemical Process Indicator (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) response can be easily determined to assess for exposure to the sterilization process cycle. <br />a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the exposure to the sterilization process cycle to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments. <br />b. Evaluator will visually inspect the Indicators for ease of determining exposure to the sterilization process cycle. <br />4. After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class External Pack Tape and Tag) do not easily detach from sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans. <br />a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must remain securely attached to instrument packs to differentiate processed/unprocessed instrument packs in inventory/storage. <br />b. Evaluate will assess for secure attachment of Indicators after the completed sterilization process cycle. <br />5. After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class II Chemical Process Indicator (Bowie-Dick type test) response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (pack load). <br />a. Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments. <br />b. Before pack load is sterilized, Class II Chemical Process Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer's guidelines/instructions. After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.<br />6. After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class V Chemical Integrator Indicator response can be easily determined as Safe/Sterile or Unsafe/Unsterile for sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.<br />a. Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.<br />b. Before sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan is sterilized, Class V Chemical Integrator Indicator is place inside sample test tray/pan according to manufacturer's guidelines/instructions. After process cycle is completed evaluator will visually inspect the Indicators for ease of determining successful exposure to the sterilization process cycle. <br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?).<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<DESC>Introductory Paragraph<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this project is 541712. <br />
<p><br />Background<br />The mandate of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is to provide information about potentially toxic chemicals to regulatory and research agencies, and to strengthen the science base in toxicology. As part of NTP's effort to fulfill its mission, NTP, on an annual basis, selects approximately 10 new chemicals for testing, has 20-30 subchronic studies, has 30-40 chronic studies in different stages of testing and evaluation, and presents approximately 15 subchronic and chronic studies for public peer review. NTP also reviews an additional 30 reproductive, perinatal, multigenerational and developmental studies on a yearly basis. Studies are conducted in vitro, and subchronic and chronic studies are conducted in rodents. These studies are done predominantly at contractor laboratories which are monitored by NTP staff. This work is currently being conducted under the following three (3) contracts: N01-ES-55551 held by Battelle Memorial Institute, N01-ES-55552 held by Midwest Research Institute and N01-ES-65554 held by Research Triangle Institute.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this project is to provide Chemistry Support Services for the NTP. The objective of this project is to provide all of the chemistry support activities of the non-inhalation and non-aquatic toxicology laboratories for the NTP to include chemical procurement, characterization, and dose formulation services.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />Major tasks required include the following:<br />1) Procurement, including handling and shipment chemicals, test articles, and samples produced <br />in support of NTP activities.<br />2) Chemical characterization, including all activities related to establishing the identity and <br />determining the purity of a chemical, test article or sample, including developing methods needed to perform the analysis.<br />3) Dose Formulation, including all activities related to dose preparation, mixing, and analysis of <br />formulations containing a chemical, test article or sample in a variety of vehicles (e.g., corn oil, water, aqueous methylcellulose, feed, air, etc.), including developing and validating methods needed to perform the analyses.<br />4) Biosample Analysis, including all activities related to determination of the concentration of a <br />chemical, test article, sample or its metabolites in a variety of matrices (e.g., blood, plasma, liver, kidney, fat, commercial dietary supplements, filters, etc.), including developing and validating methods needed to perform the analyses.<br />5) Animal Studies, including all activities requiring administration of test article(s) to animals. <br />This includes activities related to determining the toxicokinetics of a chemical, test article or sample administered to an animal (usually rodents), and establishing the palatability of chemical formulations administered to an animal.<br />6) Special Chemical Analysis, includes all activities that are part of the overall scope of the <br />contract, but are not contained within a single functional area, or represent only a portion of a functional area. For example, a dose analysis assignment that includes a validation or a dose formulation development effort that includes a validation but not a stability study, are special chemical analyses.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations<br />This work requires the contractor to have or establish a materials handling facility capable of <br />safely processing and containing chemicals including suspect human carcinogens.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is September 30, 2010 through November 15, 2009.</p>
<p><br />Information Sought<br />Interested organizations are required to submit five (5) hard copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length; not including a standard product brochure that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and should be tailored to the "Project Requirements" as concise as possible.</p>

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR>     The Southeast Region (Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of HAND SANITIZERS.  The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to, Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is February 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast region, the government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Points of Contact: Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of HAND SANITIZERS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $372,939.39.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process. <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified in Phase I or Phase II will be notified in writing (via email) at the conclusion of the evaluation process which is DSCP approval and the signing of the agreement by the final authority.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions / quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to VIRGINIA.SLAYTON@US.ARMY.MIL by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:    <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Hand Sanitizers products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.

Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Note vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST submit Hand Sanitizers with an alcohol content of between 60%-95% [per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, October 2002].  Vendor MUST submit documentation on Liquids/Gels and Foams to support the alcohol base content in response to this RFRIAQ.  Note: Vendors who do not provide documentation will be disqualified in Phase I. <BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.<BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP final approval).<BR>Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  The TRBO will notify all qualified/invited vendors of their products arrival.  Vendors WILL NOT need to require signature to verify delivery. Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  <BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers)  Hand Sanitizer products dispense amount effortlessly without repeated attempts, clogging, or dripping from the dispensing nozzle/flip top.  <BR>a.	Obtaining adherence of healthcare workers to use Hand Sanitizers is critical in the reduction of risks of health care-associated infections and it is important to have easy to use products.<BR>b.	The evaluator will open the Hand Sanitizer product and during dispensing monitor the tip for potential clogging and/or dripping from the nozzle/flip top. <BR>2.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers)  Hand Sanitizer product absorbs easily and quickly (less than 30 seconds).  <BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that do not absorb easily and quickly are more apt not to be utilized by Healthcare Workers thus increasing the risk of health care-associated infections.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will put the manufactured required amount of product on hand and then rubbing hands together for 30 seconds, observes hands for drying of product.  <BR>3.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers) -  Hand Sanitizers do not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue build- up on the skin after absorption.<BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue on the hands are not only less likely to be used but also have the potential to interfere with glove usage and decreasing the efficiency of the gloves.  <BR>b.	As the evaluator rubs their hands together during usage, the evaluator will observe the hands for any greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue build up on the skin after absorption.    <BR>4.	(NPSG.07.01.01  Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections specifically-to comply with current World Health Organization (WHO) Hand Hygiene Guidelines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hand hygiene guidelines by placing emphasis on the proper usage of Hand Sanitizers) - Hand Sanitizers product leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and non-irritated (not dry, cracked, chafed or irritated).<BR>a.	Hand Sanitizer products that leave the hand feeling dry, cracked, chafed or irritated are less likely to be utilized and thus increasing the risk of health care-associated infections.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will observe the hands 30 seconds after usage and observe hands for drying, cracking, chaffing or irritation of the skin.  <BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.	  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) period from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor and (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 12 NOVEMBER 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notification of the 50th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA2550-02-C-0004, Civil Engineering Operations and Maintenance Services (CEOMS) for a period of one (1) month. The period of performance for this extension will be 01 Nov 2009 through 30 Nov 2009, inclusive. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, Aleut Global Solutions, L.L.C.; 5540 Tech Center Drive Suite 104; Colorado Springs, CO 80919. A competitive, Section 8(a) Set-Aside was awarded on 21 March 2002 for civil engineering operations and maintenance services for the operations facilities at Schriever AFB, to include the associated systems infrastructure. Services include operation, maintenance, repair, incidental construction, test and inspection of all installed Real Property (RP) and Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) to include Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems, electrical distribution systems, lightning protection, facility water systems, sanitary sewer systems, and solid state uninterrupted power systems (SSUPS). Additionally, the contractor is responsible for fire suppression and standpipe systems for all facilities on Schriever AFB, with the exception of two buildings, and for the vehicle gate entrapment areas. Services are required 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract. The contract type is fixed-price incentive fee. The extension will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services to the Schriever AFB operations described above. This one-month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and not awarding a one (1) month extension would cause serious injury to the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required during the one month extension period would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension period, based on this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Michael Wittkopf at Michael.wittkopf@schriever.af.mil.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to modify the existing Communications Analysis, Systems Integration, and Engineerig Services (CASIES) contract, FA8808-06-C-0002, to increase the level of effort for the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) program and the MILSATCOM Systems Wing Engineering (MCSW/EN) for Option Years 3 and 4 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a) (2).
<p>The modification for increased CASIES support will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Linquest Corporation, 5140 Goldleaf Circle, Los Angeles CA, 90056-1299.</p>
<p>The purpose of this action is to authorize increased support for 50 full time equivalent (FTE) persons on the CASIES contract to meet MCSW mission needs. This modification does not add new requirements to, nor extend the period of performance of, the CASIES contract.</p>
<p>The MILSATCOM Systems Wing issued a Sources Sought Synopsis on 15 April 2005 to solicit input from industry and examined the acquisition history of this type of support to the EPS and EN program.

<p>This notice is for information purposes only and the Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS:

Pursuant of FAR 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,” the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to award a sole-source order for custom labels to E-Labels Solutions.
A requirement for the custom labels was recently publicized, competed, and awarded.  The vendor shipped a portion of the requirement after OPM approved a pre-production sample.  The majority of the labels under the shipment were found deficient and unable to be used.  As such, OPM-FISD has been placed in a serious work stoppage situation and must award to a vendor that has previously produced an acceptable product. 
The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 323110 – Commercial Lithographic Printing.  This is not a solicitation for quotations, but rather a notice of the Agency’s intent to make a sole-source award to E-Labels Solutions.  There will be no solicitation issued or available.  This notice is for information only. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  FURHTERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
 You may email questions regarding this notice to the issuing office at: Kelly.Kane@opm.gov or fax to: 724.794.1152 Attention: Kelly Kane.

<DESC>Using Recovery Act funding, the Indian Health Service intends to issue a modification to task order number FB7507003T3, a competitively awarded T&M task order for the Resource Patient Management System core application development and support. The contractor will provide software and technical support and training on a number of specialized components of the RPMS subject to the original SOW.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. 


This existing contract must be used because this method of procurment enables ARRA funded work to begin immediately as the work falls under the scope of an existing task.  A sub task to the existing task is being used for the sole purpose of keeping the ARRA fudning separate, as is required. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing awards are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification. 


The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FFP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FFP contracts.  The T&M pricing arrangement was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing task has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk however, there are unknowns which make it impossible to predict the extent and duration of the workload  or to predict the costs in advance.

Name of Facility: Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge
Name of Agency: U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Pacific Remote Islands NWR Complex
Revision Number: 1
1.0. BACKGROUND: 
On October 14, 1993, the Taiwanese long-line fishing vessel, the Jin Shiang Fa ran aground on Rose Atoll's southwest ocean reef margin.  The ship quickly broke up on the upper reef slopes and flats of the atoll. Salvage efforts in late 1993 removed the bow section from the reef crest but were not successful in removing the other larger broken pieces of the ship from the reef.  During the subsequent decade, wave action scattered the ship's metallic and non-metallic debris over many acres of the southwest shallow reef flats and lagoon, and pushed some of the large pieces of wreckage from the ocean reef slope up on the southwestern reef flats. In April 1999 before the cleanup operations commenced, thousands of pieces of ship metal debris were scattered over a wide area on the SW reef crest and offshore reef slopes with non-metallic debris scattered over a broader area in the lagoon. In June 2005, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory submersibles Pisces IV & V were used to conduct dives off the deep fore reef of the SW side of the atoll to confirm the absence of the bow section of the ship on the deep SW reef slope. Subsequently, all remaining metallic and non-metallic debris was removed from all reef and lagoon habitats during seven trips between July 1999 and March 2007. 
The schedule of the proposed work is to be on site Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge from January 2010 and depart from Pago Pago Harbor on January 25, 2010, and return from Rose to Pago Pago Harbor by  February 3, 2010 weather permitting. The purpose of the contract is to provide travel and logistical support for up to 12 scientists involved on surveys of marine and terrestrial wildlife at Rose Atoll; remove all coconut trees and seedlings from Rose Island; remove invasive algal growths from approximately 17 patch reefs in the lagoon; provide up to a dozen scuba tanks and refills; and chartering the vessel that would back-stop all activities including provision of food, water, drinks accommodations, bathrooms, travel while at sea, and use of cranes and other equipment to launch, retrieve and operate skiffs, load and discharge debris (coconuts, seedlings and invasive algae). While at Rose from 4 to 8 scientists will be camping on Rose Island while the rest will remain on the charter vessel during non-working hours. 
1.1 SCOPE: The proposed work shall encompass the following tasks: 1.1.1 The selected contractor confirms to the Government that the required schedule for travel to and from Rose Atoll and work at Rose Atoll will be met within 5 days of contract award. 1.1.2 After contract award, the Contractor shall mobilize skiffs, scuba tanks, equipment, and supplies and personnel needed for coconut tree, coconut seedlings, and cyano-bacterium (blue-green algae) removal and disposal, load their work vessel and skiffs in accordance with the schedule, and travel to Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.  The Contractor shall be responsible for transporting their vessel, personnel and equipment to Rose Atoll to be used for the loading and disposing of the debris.  The Contractor shall provide room, board, and 12 scuba tank fills and refills for representatives of the Contractor, Government and workers sponsored by the Government, including the Government Contracting Officer Representative (GCOR). The two representatives from the American Samoa Government may accompany the Contractor's trip to Rose Atoll to accomplish marine or land surveys, and help the GCOR document or engage in the clean up work. 1.1.3  The Contractor shall utilize his vessels, equipment, supplies, and personnel to accomplish the removal of blue-green algae, coconut seedlings, and all but one coconut tree from Rose Atoll's patch reefs and Rose Island. The debris shall be floated on the surface or hauled by skiff and transported to the support ship via the contractors work boat or Samoan catamaran (alia). The contractor will then be responsible for the ultimate disposition or disposal of all debris.

The purpose of this special notice is to advertise the Industry Day in order to help NIST identify small businesses or small business concerns as part of market research. The Government intends to solicit these acquisitions as 100% small business set asides. All small businesses or small business concerns (SB SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. The main requirements are assigned a NAICS code of 237130, 236220, and 238220 with a small business size standard for such requirements of $33.5M, $33.5M, and $14M respectively.</p>
<p>The specific purpose of this Industry Day Announcement is to generate small business awareness of, and interest in, upcoming projects.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY</span></strong><br /><em><strong>NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS<br /></strong></em><br />The purpose of this Modification 25 is to obligate $205,696 in funding in support of Work Assignment (WA 1-101; WA 1-103; and WA 1-104). The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-101 will be from May 11, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Funding for WA 1-101 is $979,000. The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-103 will be from June 15, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Funding for WA 1-103 is $287,696. The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-104 will be from October 9, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Initial funding for WA 1-104 is $36,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WA 1-101</span> will have the contractor support EPA in efforts to help inform and coordinate Regional decision-making on requests for waivers for the requirements of section 1605 of the ARRA. The contractor shall provide technical expertise in assessing each individual waiver request's technical strengths and weaknesses. The contractor shall provide a summary report on each waiver request to help inform Regional decision-making on these requests. Work to be preformed under this contract shall include:<br /><br />&bull; Collect and log all requests for waivers.<br />&bull; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with one of the justifications under ARRA.<br />&bull; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates when needed to evaluate waiver requests.<br />&bull; Prepare a report on each waiver documenting the steps taken in evaluating the waiver request and an analysis focusing on the individual waiver request's technical strengths and weaknesses.<br />&bull; Provide copies of all documentation used in the evaluation.<br />&bull; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Under Work Assignment 1-103</span> the contractor shall provide expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts including oversight of State ARRA programs; developing fact sheets and questions and answers (Q&amp;As) on key ARRA aspects and issues such as flexibility in set asides and needed testing of financial tracking approaches; and providing training to EPA Regional and State drinking water staffs on the latest Agency ARRA policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Under Work Assignment 1-104</span> the contractor shall provide support to EPA Region 5 for the review of two Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) green project "business cases" in each of its six states to justify that projects qualified for the GPR under ARRA. The review of two green business cases from each state will help Region 5 achieve the goal of consistent oversight of the GPR requirement. A secondary objective is to provide technical assistance to states in their reviews of the information that has been submitted to them and is being used to create "business cases" which will qualify projects for the GPR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 1-104 will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under the green project reserve of the ARRA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic intends to negotiate a sole source contract in theestimated amount of less than $400,000.00 to Rohde & Schwarz, 302 SentinelDrive, Suite 105, Annapolis Junction, MD 20701-1052.  The purpose of thiscontract is to provide one HF-System (2x 1kW HF-Tx/Rx + 1x VLF-HF-Rx), Up-gradeNSC.  In addition to the above the required Rohde & Schwarz HF equipment can bemonitored and operated by means of an RS-422 interface.  The  basebandcommunications switch contains software that was specifically written tointerface with the required Rohde & Schwarz HF equipment over the RS-422interface.  No other manufacturer's equipment can interface with the existingbaseband switch.  The only current manufacturer of single channel HF narrowbandequipment is Rohde & Schwarz.  The customer cannot support wideband HFequipment as there is no physical space to install wideband antennas.  WidebandHF antennas take up much more space than narrowband HF antennas.  The HFequipment also supports Automated Link Establishment (ALE) and can operate onLink 11, both of which are the customers operational requirements.  Alldocumentation, training programs and support structure and mechanism istailored around the Rohde & Schwarz HF equipment.  Any other equipment wouldrequire a total overhaul of the entire support, training and documentationprogram for the customer.  This would incur significant monetary and time costsand could delay operational abilities.  Comments shall be submitted in writingto Penny Leya, Code 2.2.5.5PL, penny.leya@navy.mil, prior to 2:00 p.m. EST on28 October 2009.  Reference NOTE 22 applies.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) <strong>o Are, o are not presently debarred</strong>, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) <strong>o Have, o have not, </strong>within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) <strong>o Are, o are not presently indicted for</strong>, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) <strong>o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes</strong> in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br /><strong>(1) o Are, o are not</strong> presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br /><strong>(2) o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br /><strong>(3) o Are, o are not</strong> presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br /><strong>(4) o Have, o have not,</strong> within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contracting Officer shall make a best value award decision based on the following evaluation factors: Proposals will be evaluated against the requirements of the RFQ and in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to perform the services required. General statements such as "the vast resources of our nationwide company will be used to perform the services required by the Statement of Work" are not sufficient. The Offeror shall clearly address each element of the SOW. Any proposal failing to address all of the elements may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding in response to the Government's requirements and may be considered unacceptable. Factor I. Technical Ability to Satisfy the SOW - all factors of the SOW must be addressed by the contractor. Factor II. Experience -The Offeror must demonstrate hands-on experience with CACI's C-Buy procurement software tool. Experience with C-Buy system must be at the journeyman level and must be recent experience (i.e., in the last 12 months). Experience with C-Buy is the most important and critical skill for the evaluation of this quote. Offerors must also demonstrate hands-on experience in federal procurement/acquisition, especially in creating solicitations, evaluations of bids and proposals, preparing all evaluations and files to support a contract award (FAR Parts 15, 12, and 13 desired), and contract administration(contract administration is the least desired skill). Factor III. Past Performance - Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual performance of similar services to industry or government agencies (contractor format for past performance data is desired). Past performance will consider the reviews/ratings of other users who presently use or used offerors services. Offerors must include records of at least two recent contracts, within the last 3 years, and identify a point of contact for each by providing a name and telephone number. Failure to submit past performance information (or to address past performance) with your proposal will result in your proposal being made non responsive. Factor IV. Price. The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the Government to determine whether the services meets the parameters of the SOW. Technical ability combined with past performance is significantly more important than price, and the contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror. Proposals will be rated using the following color adjective ratings: Blue (exceeds), Green (acceptable), Yellow (marginal), Red (unacceptable). The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete their annual representations and certification at http://orca.bpn.gov and complete paragraph (b) of 52.212-3 or, if annual certifications not completed, complete and sign paragraph (c) through (m) of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009) with its offer.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSAL ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10030, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519, which has a small business size standard of 500 employees.   A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  EPA has a requirement for a Contractor to provide an Approved PM 10-2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) Sampler Pair.

Background
The EPA issued revisions to the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations (40 CFR Parts 53 and 58) on October 17, 2006 (U.S. EPA 2006a).  The final monitoring rule contains a requirement for PM10-2.5 speciation at NCore multi-pollutant monitoring sites by January 1, 2011, with state monitoring implementation plans due July 1, 2009.  As compared to the proposed rule, the final rule increases the number of monitoring sites from ~20 to ~75 and shifts the focus from urban monitoring to both urban and rural monitoring locations.  Manually-operated PM10-2.5 speciation samplers must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule and be collocated with PM2.5 speciation at NCore stations.  
Since EPA is requiring PM10-2.5 speciation monitoring primarily for scientific purposes, it is appropriate to have monitoring at a variety of urban and rural locations to increase the diversity of areas that will have available chemical species data.  NCore will have about 75 sites mostly in urban areas, with a subset of about 20 rural sites.
One of the next steps for development and implementation of a long-term PM10-2.5 speciation monitoring program at NCore is the development of a pilot monitoring study.  Several issues need to be addressed in order to develop the long-term PM10-2.5 speciation implementation plan. Prior to long-term monitoring, it is appropriate to have a pilot network of a few sites to improve our understanding of the issues associated with PM10-2.5 speciation monitoring and to determine the most appropriate way to measure PM10-2.5 species at NCore. 

Purpose
The purchase of PM10-2.5 speciation samplers will support a pilot project in which State and local agencies will operate commercially available PM10-2.5 samplers and help develop laboratory analysis methods and procedures for the long-term PM10-2.5 speciation monitoring network. Samplers are expected to be distributed to two separate monitoring agencies in the United States.  Host monitoring agencies will operate the samplers to collect the appropriate filter media for PM10-2.5 speciation analyses and method evaluation/improvement; and provide experiences with the operation of the equipment.  The analysis of filters collected by the host agencies will be provided by EPA?s contractor and not under this equipment procurement.

Mandatory Specifications
Approved PM10-2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) Sampler Pair
1.	Must be an approved FRM for PM10-2.5 mass and meet all of EPA?s Part 50, Appendix O requirements. Refer to the following web site for a list of designated reference and equivalent methods: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/criteria.html 2.	Must be able to operate both sequentially or manually for collection of sample filters.3.	Must contain all minimal items/accessories necessary for proper operation.
The contractor shall provide a quote for the following:  (A) Two (2) Pairs of the Approved PM10-2.5 Federal Reference Method (FRM) Sampler Pair (B) Associated costs for shipping, handling, and insurance of delivery to the U.S. EPA Research Triangle Park, NC 4-6 weeks from date of award.  
The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror who proposes the lowest price, technically acceptable offer.  All offerors are to include with their offers a completed copy of provision 52.212-3, Offer or Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items.  The following FAR clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; 52.204-6 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration and the following additional FAR clauses which are cited in Clause 52.212-5; 52.222-3, Convict Labor; 52.222-21, Prohibitions of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26,Equal Opportunity;  52-222-35, Affirmative Actions for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; 52.222-37; 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons; 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer- Central Contractor Registration.

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The SIR is amended to provide answers to the questions submitted by the offerors as of September 18, 2009.  Additionally, to provide updates to the following amended sections: Section B, Section C, Sections D-E-F-G-H-I, Section J, Section J Attachments (PENDING CHANGES TO FAA-E-3007: 3.3.2.1 and Appendix A (VRTM)), and Section L.  No other changes.
The SIR is amended to extend the deadline of the technical proposals, cost proposals, and letter stating the intent to provide an operational LED PAPI for OCT.  The date has been extended to Novemebr 23, 2009.  No other changes.
The SIR is amended to provide answers to the questions submitted by the offerors.  No other changes.  
The SIR is amended to provide an updated Operational Safety Assessment (OSA).  No other changes.
As part of the FAA Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) plan, the FAA is seeking modern, efficient technology that will reduce the life-cycle cost of approach lighting systems. By using proven technology, systems can be quickly implemented, significantly reducing the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. As a result, the FAA is releasing this Screening of Information Request (SIR) to acquire up to 500 Light Emitting Diode (LED) Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) systems.
This competitive SIR is a 100% set-aside for Small Business. In responding to this SIR, the offeror must certify as to its eligibility as a small business under the applicable North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code that follows. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335129, Other Lighting Equipment Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500.
The LED PAPI acquisition process consists of two phases. Phase 1 consists of the receipt and evaluation of technical proposals, which includes technical approach, management approach, and past performance sections; receipt and evaluation of Cost Proposals; and an Operational Capability Test (OCT) of LED PAPI systems. Offerors must achieve an adjectival rating of satisfactory or better for all factors of Phase 1 in order to be considered for award.
The Technical Proposal and the Cost proposals are due 60 calendar days from the date of this announcement. As a part of the SIR/Request for Offer (RFO), interested vendors are required to deliver LED PAPI systems that will meet the requirements of Specification FAA-E-3007 to the designated Government Test Facility not less than four months but not more than five months from the date of this announcement. An Operational Capability Test (OCT) will then take place over a two-month period to determine if the optical design meets the LED PAPI functional requirements. Based upon the OCT results, evaluation of the technical proposals, and evaluation of the cost proposals, the FAA will select the vendor whose LED PAPI system best meets the FAA requirements identified in FAA-E-3007 and the SOW. 
Phase 2 follows contract award and consists of design, build, and testing of the LED PAPI system, and development and delivery of all documents and services identified in the RFO. The FAA reserves the right to award no contract at all based on the final results of the evaluations. The FAA reserves the right to make an award to the Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the FAA. The best value is defined as the proposal that presents the most advantageous solution to the FAA, based on the evaluation of the Offeror's Technical Proposal (Volume I), Relative Experience and Past Performance (Volume III), Operational Capability Test (OCT) results, and Price Proposal (Volume II). The best value approach provides the opportunity for technical and cost/price tradeoffs and does not require that an award be made to either the offeror submitting the highest rated technical proposal or the offeror submitting the lowest price. Contract award is anticipated within 120 days after completion of the LED PAPI system evaluation. See the attached RFO for additional proposal requirements, due dates, and delivery information.
All interested parties must submit their technical proposals, cost proposals, and a letter stating their intent to provide an operational LED PAPI for OCT, within 60 calendar days from the date of this announcement
Prospective offerors are hereby given notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under current announcements for FAA Headquarters, Washington, DC. It is the offerors responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with preparation of responses to this SIR and will not reimburse or otherwise pay equipment costs incurred by any party responding. The FAA will provide 30 calendar days from the date of this announcement for questions/comments. Questions concerning this SIR must be in writing and should be addressed to the FAA LED PAPI Contracting Officer, Mr. Brian Anderson, by email to Brian.Anderson@faa.gov. The FAA will not respond to telephonic requests for information. FAA responses to questions, excluding vendor name, will be made public and published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under current announcements for FAA Headquarters, Washington, DC.

d. Provide sustainable design support for work place initiatives; and 
e. Support existing GSA green leasing initiatives.  


This project shall be awarded with a firm fixed price (FFP) contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. For this requirement, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is considered significantly more important than price. 

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the best value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.   

The below factors are listed in descending order of importance:
a. 	Technical Approach
b. 	Past Performance
c. 	Key Personnel

The combined technical factors of Past Performance and Key Personnel are of equal importance to Technical Approach.  In addition, the three (3) combined technical factors (Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Key Personnel) are significantly more important than Price.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a Redevelopment/modernization of an existing early 1940s warehouse (1202) located at Federal Center South campus. The building is a timber-framed single story warehouse with exterior concrete walls. The building is supported on timber piles with concrete followers. The followers are 14inch in diameter by 11 feet long and extend from the underside of the concrete slab to the top of the timber piles. Single piles are spaced 8 feet on center. The building is approximately 330 feet wide by 1100 feet long and is immediately to the west of the historic Albert Kahn-designed Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant (1201) completed in 1932, at 4735 East Marginal Way Seattle, WA. The proposed project site will encompass approximately 50% of the footprint of the existing building. The 1202 building has been determined not to be historic. This project will provide for the projected 15-year space requirements of the USACE and is the pivotal undertaking for a campus-like site redevelopment that can accommodate the 30-year expansion requirements for a number of other Federal Agencies. This project will help to revitalize the neighborhood and receive an architectural treatment that is responsive to its context and due to its adjacency to the 1201 building compatible with historic precedents.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/egineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards and will address the specific tenant requirements of the USACE. The warehouse redevelopment/modernization will include 150,000-200,000 gross square feet of new office space for the USACE and may include space for a child care facility and cafeteria food services. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals. The project goal is to meet LEED-NC, Gold rating requirements. All Federal accessibility requirements and standards will also be met as required by law.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the redevelopment of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The work will also include seismic upgrades and repair and/or replacement of the existing foundation, stabilization of liquefiable soils and any associated site development. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, historic architecture and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, Building Information Modeling (BIM), metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards for secure facilities, USACE force protection requirements and USACE tenant requirements. The design-builder should incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) strategies. The design-builder will be required to work with artist(s) in support of the Art-in-Architecture Program.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $50,000,000.00 and $70,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A $50,000 - $75,000 stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using Best Value Source Selection pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range (short list) to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase 2 solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase 2 RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/17/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: The estimated closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals is October 16, 2009.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>Reference is made to the September 21, 2009 announcement, reference number 200951028A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Panama - Air Cargo Facility Feasibility Study. The following questions have been answered.
<p>QUESTION 1<br />We understand from the TORs and the clarifications provided in Modification 1 that a preliminary schematic concept design has already been prepared for the facility. Is it possible to obtain a copy of this schematic design or information regarding the general parameters, size (m2) and/or estimated cost of the facility? In order to provide an adequate estimate of input required for preparation of detailed architectural and structural designs, it is important for us to understand the size and general concept for the development of this facility.</p>
<p>ANSWER 1<br />The preliminary schematic concept design is attached to this modification and the size and cost of the facility are noted in the Desk Study, which is included in the RFP. <br /><br />QUESTION 2<br />Please clarify if the Grantee has already carried out topographic and/or geotechnical studies that would serve as input to the design work included in the Consultant's proposed scope of work. Also, please clarify if the grantee will be contracting engineers for other disciplines (e.g. civil, electrical, mechanical, etc.) to carry out the complementary designs in a synchronized manner with the architectural and structural design team, as it may not be possible for the architectural or structural to be finalized without having input from the other disciplines.</p>
<p>ANSWER 2<br />The Grantee does have topographic studies. The Consultant will be required to conduct the geographical studies. The Consultant is expected to produce a conceptual architectural and structural design of the facility, which the Grantee will use for the complementary designs. <br /><br />QUESTION 3<br />Although it is understood that as a deliverable of the project, the blueprints should be signed by a locally licensed and practicing architect, please clarify if the designs will need to be approved by any local agencies or entities. If so, it is envisioned that the Consultant would have any responsibility in participating in this process?</p>
<p>ANSWER 3<br />The Consultant is responsible for obtaining the signature of the locally licensed and practicing architect and the Grantee will help the Contractor with approval from local agencies or entities.</p>
<p>QUESTION 4<br />Is the budget amount negotiable? If a proposal quotes a budget higher than the $258,000 grant amount, will this proposal be considered?</p>
<p>ANSWER 4<br />No. The grant amount is a fixed price, there is no negotiating on the total cost of the study.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - Modification 01 awarded under Task Order 0003 for additional work under the Efficient Small Scale Propulsion (ESSP) Core Engine Demonstrator Design and Risk Reduction which obligates Recovery Act funding. Task Order 0003 was awarded on 29 May 2009 and funded entirely with Recovery Act funding. The additional work supports the design (small turboshaft testbed engine), component risk reduction (turboshaft testbed component), and hardware fabrication (risk reduction testbed engine) of the ESSP. The contract was solicited and awarded competitively using competitive procedures which resulted in award of 15 contracts.
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded per FAR 16.301-2.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS), San Juan, Puerto Rico, has awarded contract VA248-P-1278 for Preventive Maintenance and Repairs for the Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) and Access Control Systems at VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) and its satellite clinics for a base period of one (1) year and an option period of six (6) months. Below is the approved justification and authorization for use of other than full and open competition. Award was made in the amount of $106,344.00 for the base period.MEMORANDUMDate: September 1, 2009										From:	Contracting Officer (672/PBD)Subj:	JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL	AND OPEN COMPETITION; PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICE AND REPAIRS        FOR THE CLOSED CIRCUIT TV (CCTV) AND ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMSTo:	File1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Rios Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzalez Giusti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This is sole source contract action for a base period of one (1) year with an option period of six (6) months from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010 with Security Integration Group, Inc. for preventive maintenance services and repairs for the security surveillance equipment for Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) and access control systems at VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS), San Juan, Puerto Rico and its satellite clinics at Ponce and Mayagez, Puerto Rico.  Current contract is expiring in September 30, 2009. Estimated cost is $133,578.00. 3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Work includes the provision of maintenance and repair services to subject systems, including the provision of replacement parts/components. Maintenance services consist of inspections, cleaning, lubrication, adjustment, calibration, reprogramming after memory loss, and replacement of nonfunctioning equipment. 4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals. The security surveillance equipment for Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) and access control systems being used at VACHS constitutes an important component of the security surveillance system. This system records visual activities that must be stored for a period of time to substantiate any investigation and provide such recording as supporting evidence during such investigation. These recordings could be the sole evidence of any criminal activity or misconduct on VA property. The unnoticed breaches in security, followed by the subsequent loss of either personnel or sensitive data, have heightened the need for the CCTV and video surveillance as part of the security systems in our organization. Surveillance systems captures, transmit and records real-time data acts as a crime deterrent. Security Integration Group, Inc. is the contractor presently performing the maintenance and repair services required. Security Integration Group, Inc. is the only responsible source with the expertise and available resources to perform this task during the time frame required. Security Integration Group, Inc. is a local company for sales, support and experience with our current equipment and in compliance with the aforementioned missions needs. This action is the only cost effective way to continue with these critical services without interruption until a new contract is awarded. Contractor is a Small Business.6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: A new, long term acquisition is pending development of a medical center wide scope of work. Development of scope of work is being impacted by the new South Bed Tower construction that is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. This new building will include security devices and surveillance equipment that has not yet been installed. Police Service has also completed physical security assessment of this new structure and additional equipment has been estimated. This is pending approval, completion of the South Bed Tower construction and equipment installation. Also, at least half of the existent equipment has been or is being replaced with new equipment. We need to have all this equipment installed and merge into one maintenance contract.  Service will finalize developing new scope of work to conduct market survey once the final requirements are finally determined.7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION: Estimated cost is $133,578.00. Estimated cost is based on current costs.  A request for proposal will be issued to the Contractor.  Contractors proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost.  Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price for both parties. 8.  MARKET RESERCH: A market survey was not conducted for this action since Security Integration Group, Inc. is the only firm that can meet Government requirements within the timeframe required as indicated in paragraph 5 and 6 above. 9.  OTHER FACTORS: None10.  INTERESTED SOURCES: No other sources can provide the services in accordance with the Government needs in the required time frame. Refer to paragraph 8.11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Refer to paragraph 6. 12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.NAME:  Silvia Y.
