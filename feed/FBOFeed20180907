<p>20. Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DLA AVIATION - AOB's CA/ombudsman can be reached at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Complaints which cannot be so resolved shall be forwarded to the HQ through J-72 for resolution by the DLA competition advocate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each activity is responsible for developing procedures for executing the duties and responsibilities of its local.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>;</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the office of the Program Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems (PM MAS) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFQ) for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Production of the 40mm High Velocity (HV) XM1176 High Explosive Dual Purpose -Airburst (HEDP-AB). The cartridge will provide the warfighter with the ability to achieve the required lethal effects against enemy personnel in the open, coupled with the capability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions. Additionally, the XM1176 will be able to defeat unarmored and lightly armored vehicles. This adds an increased capability over the current M430A1 HEDP cartridge. The requirement for the XM1176 will be achieved through the replacement of the M549/M549A1 fuze to a programmable fuze and associated programming unit (PU). Under this program contractors shall provide EMD, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production of the 40mm HV XM1176 HEDP-AB cartridge and PU. The contractors shall provide all necessary labor, material, supplies, services, facilities and equipment to perform the requirements of the Statement of Work and the RFP.
<p>This procurement will be conducted utilizing full and open competition with the exception of Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) which will be restricted to the US and Canada. This restriction will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-3. It is forecasted that the resultant contract will have a total period of performance of five (5) years to include a base Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) EMD effort, a CPFF Option for Design Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E), a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) option for Low Rate Initial Production 1 (LRIP 1), a FFP Option for LRIP 2 and a FFP Option for one year of Full Rate Production (FRP). The Government intends to award up to two contracts for EMD Phase I and then will down-select to one contractor for EMD Phase II/Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E). The contract will also include options for Low Rate Initial Production 1 (LRIP1), Low Rate Initial Production 2 (LRIP2), and Production Year 1 (PY1). The Government intends to award based on the Best Value Trade Off source selection methodology.</p>
<p>This is a pre solicitation notice and the Government anticipates that a formal solicitation will be posted on or about 10 October 2018. All information is to be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms â€œcontract,â€ â€œcontractor,â€ and â€œContracting Officerâ€ shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507â€“1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQ's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) intends to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with the Health Effects Institute (HEI). HEI is a unique institution, jointly supported by both EPA and industry, established in 1980 by the EPA administrator and leaders of the motor vehicle industry to conduct and evaluate research on the health effects of air pollution emissions from motor vehicles. Under this contract, HEI will: (1) perform critical reviews of scientific literature; (2) plan and conduct representative population exposure studies; (3) plan and conduct health studies, as warranted and feasible; and (4) perform program management, quality assurance, data management, regulatory compliance, human subject research compliance, reporting production, health and safety compliance, and public communications in support of the above tasks.
<p>Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Congress outlined a series of criteria that EPA should meet in pursing the above requirements. These criteria include that the requirements should: (1) be managed by a not-for-profit institution; (2) continue existing partnerships between EPA, industry, and stakeholders; (3) leverage funding from industry; and (4) produce independent and credible science. Each of these criteria, are discussed below.</p>
<p>(1) Not for profit status: HEI is a not-for-profit institution established and funded jointly by the EPA and industry for the explicit purpose of conducting credible research to inform environmental regulatory decisions.</p>
<p>(2) Continuing partnerships with EPA, industry, and stakeholders: HEI has successfully managed the joint funding of environmental health research between EPA and the automobile industry since 1980. As HEI's work has expanded beyond a focus on automotive emissions in the United States to other sources and other regions, they have brought in additional funding partners from other industries, philanthropic foundations, and other governments. The multi-contributor, long-term funding relationships and long-term, continuing research programs established by HEI are unique in the environmental health sciences field. Furthermore, HEI has established relationships not only with the affected oil and gas industry, but also with governments, affected communities, and environmental advocacy groups interested in UOGD impacts.</p>
<p>(3) Leveraged funding: HEI has already secured commitments for matching funds from the oil and gas industry if EPA contributes to funding HEI's proposed UOGD program. No other non-profit organization has such relationships or funding commitments in place.</p>
<p>(4) Independence and credibility: HEI's unique organizational structure and research management process was designed specifically to produce independent and credible research in often adversarial contexts. For almost 40 years, HEI has maintained a reputation for producing the highest quality research and serving as an unbiased arbiter of scientific controversies. The fact that HEI has not only maintained its relationship with EPA and the automobile industry, but expanded its relationships to other industries, governments, and stakeholders is evidence of the credibility of the organization and its work. HEI has always received balanced funding from industry and Government and carefully guarded against bias, so their credibility is not compromised by past activities. <br /><br />HEI is the only known source that meets the criteria above and has the existing structure, processes, expertise, and relationships necessary to initiate the design and selection of exposure and health studies required by EPA as soon as funding is available. No other organization could initiate the required studies in such a timely fashion, thus delaying the research findings and insights required by EPA.</p>
<p>An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract, with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Task Orders (TOs) is anticipated, with a maximum value of $16 Million. The ordering period will be a single, five (5) year term.</p>
<p>This Sole Source Notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation will be issued based on this Notice. All responsible sources believing themselves capable of meeting EPA's requirements may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency. All documentation shall be submitted to the EPA point-of-contact listed with this posting within fifteen (15) calendar days of electronic posting of this Notice.</p>
<p>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed on a sole source basis. A determination not to compete this proposed requirement, following receipt of responses to this Notice, is solely within the discretion of the EPA.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541715. The anticipated award date is 2/1/19.</p>

<SUBJECT>USDA Agricultural Marketing Service Commodity Procurement RFI for Long Term Contracting
<SOLNBR>AG-BMI-LTC-18-0001
<ARCHDATE>09282018
<CONTACT>Carrie Alexander, Phone 816-926-6633, Email Carrie.Alexander@ams.usda.gov
<DESC>U.S. Department of Agriculture<br />Agricultural Marketing Service<br />Commodity Procurement Program
<p>Introduction</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this request for information is to inform the USDA commodity vendor community of the current Long Term Contracting (LTC) efforts of the Business Management Improvement (BMI) project. Currently, USDA is working to develop a pilot project utilizing multiple year contracts with options for certain products, which is intended to improve efficiency of the procurement process and to build better business relationships between USDA and industry, among other potential benefits.</p>
<p>Why is USDA exploring the expanded use of Long Term Contracts?</p>
<p>Expanding the LTC format for USDA commodity procurements was identified by several stakeholder groups, including the vendor community, recipients, and USDA personnel over the course of the BMI project as a solution to challenges currently being experienced by:<br />&#9633; Reducing administrative burden (fewer solicitations, more streamlined operational procurement procedures)<br />&#9633; Reducing supply risk<br />&#9633; Improving order fulfillment<br />&#9633; Improving consistency of product distributed to recipients</p>
<p>Benefits to the Vendor Community</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this LTC effort is aimed at addressing pain points from a wide range of stakeholder groups, including the vendor community. Potential benefits to the vendor community include:<br />&#9633; Higher guaranteed minimum quantities for awarded vendors<br />&#9633; Improved ability to forecast demand of products supplied to USDA<br />&#9633; Decreased administrative burden<br />o Less frequent and repetitive bids<br />o Streamlined ordering processes<br />&#9633; Strategic rather than transactional relationship with USDA</p>
<p><br />LTC Design Options</p>
<p>Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)</p>
<p>A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply.</p>
<p>In addition to price, when determining best value, the ordering activity may consider among other factors, the following:<br />&#9633; Past performance<br />&#9633; Special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance<br />&#9633; Delivery terms</p>
<p>Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)</p>
<p>An IDIQ contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.</p>
<p>The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each task or delivery order and the maximum that it may order during a specific period of time.</p>
<p>Side-by-side Comparison</p>
<p>BPA IDIQ</p>
<p>Scope <br />Ordering activities may establish BPAs under any schedule contract to fill repetitive needs for supplies or services. <br />An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.</p>
<p>Min-Max Requirements <br />No <br />Yes<br /><br />BPA IDIQ</p>
<p>Contract Guarantees <br />No - it is an agreement <br />Yes - number of TOs/DOs against the IDIQ</p>
<p>Structure <br />Single and multiple award BPAs <br />Preference given to making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts under a single solicitation for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources.</p>
<p>Ceilings <br />Estimates provided <br />A dollar ceiling or quantity value provided</p>
<p>Duration <br />Multiple awards BPAs should not exceed 5 years- single awards are usually 1 year <br />Base + Option</p>
<p>Benefits &#9633; Provide opportunities to negotiate improved discounts<br />&#9633; Satisfy recurring requirements;<br />&#9633; Reduce administrative costs by eliminating repetitive acquisition efforts<br />&#9633; Permit ordering activities to leverage buying power through volume purchasing<br />&#9633; Enable ordering activities streamlined ordering procedures<br />&#9633; Permit ordering activities to incorporate Contractor Team Arrangements (CTAs)<br />&#9633; Reduce procurement lead time<br />&#9633; Permit ordering activities the ability to incorporate terms and conditions not in conflict with the underlying contract<br />&#9633; Orders placed against schedule contracts may be credited toward the &#9633; Indefinite-quantity contracts permit --<br />o Government stocks to be maintained at minimum levels<br />o Direct shipment to users<br />o Flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling<br />o Ordering of supplies or services after requirements materialize<br />&#9633; Indefinite-quantity contracts limit the Government's obligation to the minimum quantity specified in the contract<br />&#9633; Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate cost or pricing arrangement under FAR Part 16. Cost or pricing arrangements that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (e.g., estimated number of labor hours) must comply with the appropriate procedures of this subpart<br /><br />BPA IDIQ<br />ordering activity's small business goals</p>
<p>References FAR section 13.303, 8.4, 16.5 https://interact.gsa.gov/blog/comparing-and-contrasting-far-84-bpas-and- idiqs</p>
<p>Economic Price Adjustments</p>
<p>A primary concern that has been raised throughout this process is the need to mitigate the risk of price fluctuation in the commodity market that may come with a longer term contract. One method that may be used to address this concern is an Economic Price Adjustment, in which prices are adjusted at certain intervals of the contract using a market-based price index that reflects general increases &amp; decreases in price over a given time period.</p>
<p>*Significant research is currently being conducted on this topic by USDA. If any vendors are familiar with or currently using any market-based price indexes that may be useful in this effort, please notify USDA at your earliest convenience. [Insert USDA POC]</p>
<p>Criteria for Choosing LTC Products</p>
<p>Based on information gathered throughout the BMI project, including industry knowledge gained through dozens of interviews, workshops, and feedback from the vendor community, USDA has established criteria for determining products that may be suitable for a LTC Pilot.</p>
<p>Products suitable to be used in the LTC pilot would have some or all of the following attributes:</p>
<p>&#9633; Positive feedback from vendors group on LTC at the 2017 AMS Industry Meeting<br />&#9633; Spend is concentrated within a small number of vendors<br />&#9633; Product has been purchased at a relatively consistent rate across recent years<br />&#9633; Relatively low price fluctuation or the availability of an index for use as an economic price adjustment<br /><br />&#9633; Products with inconsistency between vendors</p>
<p>Questions for Industry</p>
<p>Please provide responses to the following questions to Carrie Alexander @ carrie.alexander@ams.usda.gov by September 28, 2018.<br />1. Would you be receptive to the idea of moving to year-long or multiple year contracts?<br />a. What product(s) do you think would be suitable for long term contracts?</p>
<p>2. What is your ideal length of contract? Would you be receptive to options in addition to the base contract length?</p>
<p>3. How long would it be appropriate for a firm-fixed price from an initial offer to remain unchanged? Do you use price indexes for Economic Price Adjustments in long term contracts in your commercial business? If so, what indexes do you use? What other pricing mechanism(s) do you use to mitigate risks associated with price volatility?</p>
<p>4. Would moving to an annual IDIQ with quarterly or monthly releases work for you, assuming you were given enough notice for specific quantities and delivery locations?<br />a. How much notice would you require?</p>

<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for acquisition planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of respondent submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any respondent input resulting from this request. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. This information provided may be used by the US Army in developing its Acquisition Strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Respondents to this RFI are responsible for adequately marking proprietary information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR) is conducting market research to determine potential vendors in the marketplace that can perform Life Cycle Sustainment for the Plug-In Optronic Payload (POP) 300/300D that are currently supported by Stark Aerospace. The scope for this notice is for life cycle sustainment support for approximately ~ 547 POP300/300D (8 payloads are Australian assets through Foreign Military Sales and the remaining are U.S. Army assets) currently in inventory both Continental U.S. (CONUS) and Outside the Continental U.S. (OCONUS).</p>
<p>The POP300/300D Life Cycle Sustainment support strategy, both CONUS and OCONUS, includes:</p>
<p>&bull;Contractor Logistics Support Strategy<br />&bull;Sustainment Engineering Support<br />&bull;Field Service Support<br />&bull;Depot Source of Repair (DSOR) <br />&bull;Training</p>
<p>Below are the life cycle sustainment support details that describe the Government's strategy for sustainment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Contractor Logistics Support Strategy<br /></span></strong>The Government's support strategy is to provide and to continually improve payload support for the POP300/300D over its life through disposal. This may include: updating the support package, monitoring the payload performance according to industry best practices, and providing methods for seeking cost reductions through Should Cost management and other techniques. Life cycle support functions include sustaining the readiness and operational support of the payload, performing intermediate level repairs and depot level repairs, maintaining repair facility capacity and locations, maintaining Repair Turn Around Times (RTAT) for standard/non-standard/planned maintenance, assessing Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), shipping, and receiving.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Sustainment Engineering Support <br /></span></strong>The Government's sustainment strategy is to obtain and analyze engineering data to support predictive analysis, preventative maintenance, inventory management, configuration management, and Reliability, Availability &amp; Maintainability (RAM) metrics.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Field Service Support <br /></span></strong>Currently, the Government's Contractor Logistics Support contract provides Field Service Representatives (FSRs) both CONUS and OCONUS. FSRs primarily remove and replace POP300/300D in the field and send the payloads CONUS for further diagnostics and repair. The Government's field service support strategy is to minimize RTAT by assessing, diagnosing and repairing sensors at the Field Level when possible.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D. Depot Source of Repair (DSOR) <br /></span></strong>Currently, there is no Government depot level structure in place for the sensor payloads. The Government's strategy is to develop the framework for establishing a depot level repair capability to sustain the payload by facilitating an organic depot capability through a public/private partnership (P3). This support structure would allow the Government to manage component obsolescence, provide Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), conduct incoming sensor inspections, and test and verify that repairs are adequately conducted.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E. Training<br /></span></strong>Training is currently conducted at U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). The Government's strategy is to continue utilizing TRADOC to train Soldiers and to provide updates and improvements as necessary on the POP300/300D.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interested Respondent Requirements:<br /></span></strong>Respondents that can address the POP300/300D life cycle sustainment details outlined above and can provide best practice and superior sustainment solutions, please fill out the RFI Submission Items below. Respondents are requested to provide their response in PDF format. All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified. Information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure. Please limit responses to forty (40) pages or fewer. The font shall be Times New Roman and no smaller than 10pt with at least a one-inch margin. Responses are due thirty (30) calendar days from the date of posting of this RFI.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Items - POP300/300D Life Cycle Sustainment Support</span></strong> <br />Respondents shall explain their approach and identify the key tasks required to achieve and/or exceed the life cycle sustainment support strategy outlined above. Additionally,</p>
<p>1. Please provide the following: Company Name, Contact Name, Position, Telephone, E-mail, Cage Code, and Company URL.</p>
<p>2. The Government does not currently have the rights to the technical data required to support the POP300/300D. The Government intends to obtain limited technical data rights to sustain the hardware and software of the payloads over the life of the Tactical Unmanned Air Systems (TUAS) RQ-7B Shadow at a Government depot. Please indicate if there is any software embedded in your system and specify the level of data rights you are willing to provide. (Reference Section D above.)</p>
<p>3. The Government anticipates the economic useful life of the POP300/300D to be a minimum of 10 years. Outline your company's logistics support strategy to include planning, implementation, management, and oversight required to maintain and improve payload readiness and sustain the payloads through End Of Life (EOL). (Reference Section A above.)</p>
<p>4. Explain your company's approach to sustainment engineering through EOL to include: Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) management, payload maintenance data, predictive analysis, root cause analysis of in-service problems, preventative maintenance, obsolescence management, configuration management, and resolution of safety related deficiencies. Describe how RAM data can be integrated into the sustainment engineering approach to improve POP300/300D Operational Availability. (Reference Section B above.)</p>
<p>5. Explain the approach to execute the US Army's two-level maintenance system, defined as Field-level maintenance and Depot-level maintenance. Approaches should address the CONUS and OCONUS maintenance support concept for the payloads, including general strategies that enable maximum diagnostic testing and contractor maintenance and repair in the Field to minimize Repair Turn Around Time (RTAT). (Reference Section C and D above.)</p>
<p>6. Explain the approach to support the Government in the conduct of a DSOR and the establishment of P3 for the support of the POP300/300D. Provide an outline of planned transitions to determine the optimum depot-level maintenance support that considers organic, commercial, or a combination of organic and commercial sources of repair for the payload life cycle. Explain the process for detecting and repairing payload defects before Government acceptance and the quality standards used to ensure a payload is fully mission capable before going back out into the field. Data Item Description (DID) DI-ILSS-80739 may be used to determine the types of information requested for this response. (Reference Section D above.)</p>
<p>7. Provide samples of operator and maintainer training course materials for a POP300/300D, or similar component, in PDF format. Describe your company's approach to maintain and update existing operator and maintainer manuals, to include operational and maintenance instructions, parts list(s), and related technical information procedures exclusive of administrative procedures. (Reference Section E above.)</p>
<p>8. Please address whether your company has the Technical Data Package (TDP (e.g. Engineering Data for Provisioning, Training, Technical Manual, Interface Control Documents for hardware and software, etc.) for the POP300/300D. MIL-STD-31000A dated 26 February 2013 can be used for reference. If your company does not own the TDP, please explain the proposed approach to sustain the POP300/300D without the TDP.</p>

<CONTACT>Stumpf, Lora L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Academy for the Center for Chemical Process Safetyâ€™s (CCPS) HAZOP Studies and Other PHA Techniques for Process Safety and Risk Management training course, on-site at NETLâ€™s Morgantown, WV site location.  This is considered a sole source to AIChE because, to the best of the NETLâ€™s knowledge based on market research conducted, this CCPS training is only available through AIChE Academy and therefore AIChE is the only known source that can provide this service.  The NETL is required by DOE guidance (DOE Handbook DOE-HDBK-1100-96 â€“ Chemical Process Hazards Analysis) to analyze and mitigate hazards associated with in-house research projects in accordance with CCPS Hazards Analysis Techniques. Whereas there are text books for these techniques, training is required to transfer from an expert to DOE/NETL staff a common approach that is compliant with CCPS.  Utilizing another training provider would not ensure consistency with CCPS techniques & terminology in the DOE Guide; by using AIChE Academy, NETL is assured the consistency between the CCPS developed approaches, the DOE Guide requirements, and NETLâ€™s needs are met.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.

<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>This Notice is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation or an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for conducting a follow-on acquisition.  NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this Notice and NIST use of such information.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical Systems Program Office of the Engineering Lab (EL) is designing and implementing a photovoltaic power system test system to evaluate control and metrology components of the future power system. The installation is a valuable research tool helping the Smart Grid program at NIST evaluate and develop advanced inverter functions that can help address the grid stability problems posed by high levels of variable distributed generation. <br />Current standards require that inverters disconnect the distributed PV system when grid frequency or voltage falls outside a specified range. However, advanced inverters have the capability of "riding through" minor disturbances to frequency or voltage. These functions are called under/over frequency ride-through and under/over voltage ride-through. They direct the distributed system to stay online and respond accordingly to relatively short-term, minor events.<br />Voltage control is traditionally the responsibility of utilities. However, inverters can assist by changing the level of real power output from the system (limit active power) by controlling the rate at which real power is fed onto the grid (controlled active power ramping), or by injecting or absorbing reactive power into or from the grid (reactive power compensation, or dynamic reactive power control). These functions make system stability maintenance easier by keeping voltage and frequency at the point of coupling within specified limits.<br />Current inverters do not perform voltage control because voltage control traditionally interferes with their capability to provide unintentional-islanding protection. This function prevents feeding PV power onto a grid that is otherwise de-energized. Advanced inverters, including the inverter we propose to install, use real-time anti-islanding algorithms to provide voltage and ride through capability while still providing islanding protection.<br />These algorithms must be implemented on a software application that us qualified for real power systems applications. Further, the software package must be compatible with the significant research code base already existing in the testbed a set of software tools are needed. The package should be interoperable with the existing universal relay hardware already installed. Further, the tools being sought should support the development of simulations not only in the power systems field so as to allow multi-physics, multi-domain analysis capabilities. <br />Requirement:</p>
<p>NIST seeks to purchase a software application that will present substation and power system sensor data compliant with the IEC 61850 standard on a remote display and command interface. Further the software must allow direct web-based control of a General Electric MultiLin Universal Relay already purchased for this project. The software must provide data monitoring and recording functions that provides an overall, integrated view of the electrical system. It must collect real-time and historical disturbance data to assist with analyzing past and impending power system events.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following functions are required:</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor up to 1000 devices (20000 data points) or 5000 devices (65000 data points)<br />&bull;	Drag-and-drop construction of single-line monitoring screens<br />&bull;	Trending of up to 5000 power system data points with 1minute resolution<br />&bull;	Communication with third-party Modbus compliant field devices<br />&bull;	Plug-and-Play analysis of power system equipment<br />&bull;	Automatic collection of events and waveforms<br />&bull;	Annunciator alarming with visual, audio and email notification<br />&bull;	Waveform fault data recording</p>
<p>The software provided must:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide a monitoring system with an easy, pre-configured setup with little customization<br />&bull;	24x7 operation of Monitoring, Control and Data Recording <br />&bull;	On-Demand status monitoring of the status of devices <br />&bull;	Monitoring, Control and Data Recording for power systems that contain up to 150 electronic devices that can communicate using the standard Modbus TCP/IP and Modbus RTU protocol.<br />&bull;	Monitor and control a maximum of 5000 points (tags) combined between all of the 150 allowable devices.<br />&bull;	The application should be a stand-alone software package that is installed on a single workstation that has both the communications server and the HMI built into the application and not require any additional software or separate workstations for it to function.</p>
<p>The following functionality is necessary:</p>
<p>&bull;	Pre-configured monitoring screens for all GE Multilin Devices<br />&bull;	Single-Line Monitoring of power system devices<br />&bull;	Real-Time control of power system devices (Open/Close Breaker)<br />&bull;	Annunciator Alarming on monitored Analog or Digital points<br />&bull;	Automatic download of all Events from GE Multilin Devices<br />&bull;	Sorting and Searching of Device Events in a system wide Sequence of Events Record<br />&bull;	Automatic Downloading of all Waveforms from GE Multilin Devices<br />&bull;	Merging and Overlaying waveforms recorded in different power system devices<br />&bull;	Converting Waveforms stored in Comma Separated Values (.CSV) format to COMTRADE format files.<br />&bull;	Viewing any COMTRADE format waveform in Time Based, Phasor Value and Harmonic Content formats<br />&bull;	Configurable security functionality that limits access and functionality to different levels of users<br />&bull;	Connect remotely to a Viewpoint Monitoring system over a network<br />&bull;	Implement security access and control by thorough user accounts with configurable permissions<br />&bull;	The memory maps for non-GE Multilin devices that use the Modbus TCP/IP or Modbus RTU protocol must be allowed on the Single-Line Diagrams, Annunciator Alarms, and the Trending Reports.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources Sought Notice Information</span></p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>World events over the last fourteen years have highlighted the growing threat of terrorism and its many forms, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attack, the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, and the deliberate spread of anthrax and ricin through the U.S. Postal Service and Congressional office buildings. These incidents generate increasing awareness into the range of approaches used by terrorists, including the potential to use chemical, biological, and radiological/nuclear weapons. Acts of radiological or nuclear terrorism could involve the use of stolen or improvised nuclear devices, attacks on nuclear power plants or reactors, the detonation of radiological dispersal devices ("dirty bombs," which combine radioactive material with conventional explosives), or the placement of radiation sources in public locations or in food or water supplies. Besides terror threats, nuclear disasters, such as the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns and explosions of March 11, 2011, have increased awareness of radiation exposure to civilians.</p>
<p>The effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Radiation injury is directly proportional to the dose absorbed by the body and radiosensitive tissues. Depending on the dose of whole-body or partial-body exposure to external radiation, the effects can range from an increased risk of cancer years after exposure to more acute effects, including transient nausea and vomiting; hematopoietic and gastrointestinal injury, leading to immunosuppression and infection; metabolic abnormalities; hemorrhage and anemia; damage to the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous systems; and death.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The United States Government has recognized the need for improved medical countermeasures against such threats. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) charged the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with building and managing a program to develop products for the mitigation or treatment of radiation injuries from exposures due to nuclear and radiological attacks.</p>
<p>This solicitation will support research and development of radiation and nuclear medical countermeasures towards licensure or approval. The supported work will encompass work performed in the drug development pathway as well as the administrative foundation necessary to facilitate and coordinate these activities in partnership with NIAID. One Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract will be awarded to an organization to provide the comprehensive suite of product development tasks. The work will be directed and funded using Task Orders.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>

<CONTACT>Ashley N. Hawkins, Contract Specialist, Phone 9375224501, Email ashley.hawkins.8@us.af.mil
<DESC>Synopsis for Molecular Testing Reagent Kits:
<p>This is a combined Sole Source Synopsis / Solicitation published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Luminex Molecular Testing Reagent Kits for the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Epidemiology Laboratory Service Division (USAFSAM/PHE) located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. See Attachment 1, Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 325413: In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS 325413 is 1,250 employees. PSC/FSC code: 6550: In vitro Diagnostic Substances, Reagents, Test Kits.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Luminex, located at 12212 Technology Blvd, Austin, TX 78727-6131. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government, if received by Wednesday, 12 September 2018, 12:00 P.M. EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires reagent kits to perform testing for molecular samples to include flu testing for the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Epidemiology Laboratory Service Division (USAFSAM/PHE) located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. PHE requires supporting reagents that meet College of American Pathologists (CAP), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards and methodology. The proposed sole source, Luminex, is the only known source able to provide the specific reagents that are required to function IAW Federal FDA regulations and on the Luminex MAGPIX instrument to produce required respiratory patient testing for USAFSAM/PHE.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 1 October 2018</p>
<p>Delivery Destination: USAFSAM/PHE<br />2510 Fifth Street, Area B<br />Facility 20840<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7913</p>
<p>Delivery Type: FOB Destination (As defined in FAR 2.101 - Definitions, the seller or consignor is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss.)</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance: Both inspection and acceptance will be by the Government at Destination.</p>
<p>Important Notice to Contractors: All prospective awardees are required to register at the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the contract. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. For a detailed description of the applicable SAM requirements and payment information, please review the clauses included in the attached solicitation. <br />Any information should be e-mailed to both jessica.stamper.2@us.af.mil and ashley.hawkins.8@us.af.mil no later than Wednesday, 12 September 2018, 12:00 P.M. EST. Only inquiries/information received through e-mail by this date will be considered.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is FA4418-18-Q-0129. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intents to award a sole source contract for a hydraulic test stand for 437 MXS at Joint Base Charleston - Air Base.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Hydraulic International Inc, 9201 Independence Avenue, Chatsworth, CA, 91311. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is for one (1) Hydraulic Test Stand. This purchase is necessary to meet the 437 MXS need to have Critical hydraulic parts tested and controlled to insure reliablity of aircraft parts and remove delays in aircraft operability. Current system in place manufacturer is no longer in business and replacement parts are expensive and increase cost and down time waiting for parts to be delivered.. This equipment is considered mission critical and is operated and maintained by 437 MXA personnel. The system is currently out dated and does not allow for testing of upgraded aircraft parts that need to be tested. The new Hydraulic test stand(MHC A/F27T-2) has been tested and approved by the AF to accomplish these task and is the only such system in place that has went through these test. Any other system would have to be tested and approved before use would be approved for use at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) One source is capable of providing due to prior AF approval and testing.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: Hydraulic International, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the MHC A/F27T-12. Other manufacturers' products will not meet the exact form/fit of components, and would need prior testing and approval from the Air Force before being used at Air Force installations. This is a lengthy and expensive process that would not fit current needs of the 437 MXS.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), and retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made for same service.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: Market research was conducted for competing brand manufacturers and it was determined that no other system has been tested and approved for use within the Air Force and getting such testing and approval do not fit the 437 MXS timeline for acquiring a hydraulic test stand.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: The current system that is being used does not meet current needs of the 437 MXS and is causing increases in cost to replace parts and slowing aircraft repairs down and effecting mission execution. The new MHX A/F27T-12 is suited to test all appicable parts for aircraft and has been tested and approved by Air Force for installation use.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Hydraulics International Inc.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />Future procurements for Hydraulic Test Stands are usually handed through AFLCMC Robins Air Force base and because of funding issues a waiver was granted to allow purchase at local installation. All future purchase will be handle through AFLCMC Programs office..</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), BLM-AK/Fairbanks District Office intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to:
COMPANY:	Reconyx, INC. DUNS: 557504326
FOR :	$18,864.56
ON:	09/12/2018
NAICS:	333316	Photographic and Photocopying Equipment Manufacturing 
AUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval
13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency. 
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:

Bureau of Land Management is continuing a project to verify the utilization of Â¿potentialÂ¿ DallÂ¿s sheep mineral licks in the Central Brooks Range on BLM land in Alaska.  The project involves monitoring of sheep utilization in remote locations throughout over the course of all seasons and requires a number of cameras for photo documentation of sheep utilization of these areas. Reconyx cameras are being used as monitoring devices to record the presence of sheep.  A custom database designed specifically to process Reconyx photos has been purchased, fine-tuned and utilized by the BLM Ecologist to process over 38K photos gathered from 2016 to date.

The type of cameras we need for this project are highly specialized and therefore only produced by a few companies.  Considering the logistics of completing field work in Alaska (i.e. remote locations, limited access, and severe weather) we have a number of qualifications that our cameras must meet in order to be useful for our project.  
Our cameras must be weatherproof as weather in interior Alaska is highly variable and often harsh.  The detectors will be deployed for long time periods in the cold, rain and wind and will be left out over the winter months.  Cameras need to be able to withstand temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Â¿	Our detectors shall be deployed for long periods of time in remote areas.  BLM thus needs detectors that are capable of providing sustained power and that have large data storage capacity.  Ideally deployments would last up to one year with periodic (opportunistic, expensive) replacement of data cards but storage capacity and battery life should be able to last deployments of up to a year considering field work logistic challenges.  
Â¿	It is important the cameras we purchase are able to record animal movements at night since weÂ¿d like to get a sense of seasonal utilization of mineral licks by DallÂ¿s sheep into the fall and spring months where darkness become an issue.  Therefore we need No-Glow Infrared Night Vision Capacity; wildlife can be sensitive and respond to flash photography or low-glow infrared signals that other cameras have.

<DESC>a. Acquisition, by noncompetitive contract, of services to repair (by replacement) the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) existing 1200 Amp switchboard. The Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) is the national research laboratory of the United States Forest Service, which is part of USDA.
<p>b. Proposed vendor: Square D through Schneider Electric</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF WORK, INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE</p>
<p>a. History: The purpose of the project is to upgrade an existing fusible switch and retrofit with a fixed mounted circuit breaker to address safety concerns. The bolted pressure switch is the main disconnect for facilities at FPL. For safety and warranty issues the old component must be replaced by components of the same company, Square D. Square D will not work directly with the Government and has offered, through their local partner, Crescent Electric. Square D will provide the materials and some of the labor requirements of the contract, but they will only be provided through the Crescent Electric contract.</p>
<p>b. Reason for the proposed Action: The existing switch is outdated and a safety concern in the event that power needs to be disconnected at the FPL. The circuit breaker is brand name mandatory to maintain current configurations/controls. The circuit breakers must conform to the design, materials, size, and operations requirements as they pertain to the electrical switchboard panels at the FPL.</p>
<p>c. General description of requirement: Remove (3) existing 1200A Bolt-Loc 120/208VAC, single phase fusible switch and retrofill with (3) fixed mounted Masterpact NW circuit breaker. The circuit breakers will allow an immediate discontinuation of electrical flow. The reliability of the circuit breakers is critical to mission and personnel safety.</p>

<DESC>Lignin is a byproduct produced from wood delignification and pulping process. The globe annual production of lignin is approximately more than 70 million metric tons. The kraft process is the most widely used pulping process and kraft lignin accounts for more than 90% of the world's chemical pulp lignin production. However, only 1~2% of lignin is isolated from wood pulping for commercial applications, the majority is burned onsite for heat and pulping chemical recovery. With the increasing awareness of environmental issues and the depletion of fossil fuels, there is a tremendous globe research interest in utilizing biomass like lignin for the production of sustainable and renewable fuels and chemicals and carbon-based nanomaterials like active carbons, carbon fibers, templated carbon, graphene and carbon foams through thermal conversion technologies.
<p>A novel method was developed by scientists at FPL and Ligsteel LLC to produce high-value carbon foams using lignin resources. Lignin is composing 100% carbon resource in this innovative process. The resultant carbon foam has a regular open-cell structure. Densities of the carbon foam products are generally in the range of about 0.01 g/cm3 to 1.0 g/cm3. The carbon foams exhibit compressive strengths of up to about 100 MPa. A batch type manufacturing process has been developed for converting Domtar BioChoice lignin to carbon foams. The recently developed batch processes demonstrate high carbon conversion and carbonaceous materials yield (&gt; 55% C in graphene products and &gt; 65% C in carbon foam products), but have low production rate; about 100 g graphene material is produced daily over the batch type manufacturing system in FPL.</p>
<p>Therefore, a research project was developed to investigate semi-continuous manufacturing modes and to demonstrate that both graphene and carbon foam production processes are scalable for high-volume production of valuable carbonaceous materials from lignin. Searching for the potential large volume applications of lignin-derived carbonaceous materials is another objective of current project.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to use Ligsteel expertise to advance our co-patented technology to develop high-value and high-volume applications for abundant lignin.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a fimr-fixed price 3-year Indefiniate-Delivery, Indifiniate-Quantity type contract on a noncompetive basis.&nbsp;</p>

The 109th intends to pursue a single source contract with Lamar Media Corp. because market research has revealed there are only three outdoor advertising companies registered with the Outdoor Advertising Association of America that operate in the Albany area; Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar and Lang Media. A phone call to Clear Channel Outdoors branch office in NYC revealed that the farthest north of NYC that Clear Channel operates is Saugerties, NY which is roughly 65 miles south of Albany and therefore would not meet the intent of a local advertising campaign. Additionally, after researching Lang Media, I discovered that as of October 30, 2015, Lang Media had sold their NY and MA Billboard assets to Lamar Advertising in or to focus on billboard real estate opportunities and therefore recommended that I contact Lamar Advertising. Based on this information, I have determined Lamar Advertising is the only reasonable source of acquiring billboard advertising in the Albany Area that will provide adequate visibility and impressions to effectively accomplish the goal of the recruiting advertising campaign.</p>

The 109th intends to pursue a single source contract with National CineMedia (NCM) because market research has revealed there that while there are a number of small, independently owned movie theaters in the Albany area, NCM represents Regal Cinemas, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark Holdings which are the three largest regional theater circuits in the US and can offer advertising coverage on 83 screens across 8 locations within a 50 mile radius of Stratton Air National Guard Base.

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE, NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>ACTION CODE: SPECIAL NOTICE</p>
<p>CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66 - Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Newport Corporation, Tunable External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL)</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB646030-18-03150</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: September 11, 2018</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with New Focus located in Bozeman, MT for an Tunable External Cavity Diode Laser.</p>
<p>Sole Source justification is based on the following: <br /> <br />The Material Measurement Laboratory's Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) Gas Sensing Metrology group (GSMG), has a project investigating the spectroscopy of carbon dioxide, in collaboration with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 mission. The group typically employs cavity ringdown spectroscopy and photoacoustic spectroscopy to produce high quality spectral data products, including molecular line intensities.  In an effort to advance the measurement goals of the group, a high resolution, continuously, and widely tunable External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL) source in the 2.0 &mu;m wavelength region is required.</p>
<p>GSMG currently owns additional quantities of the Newport ECDL laser systems. This laser will expand the existing inventory of lasers. The group has invested significant time and resources in developing software and laser-locking techniques that would require re-development to apply to differently branded systems. Implementing alternatively branded systems would require significant investment of labor among the research staff, while acquisition of the Newport system could be implemented immediately. Acquisition of the Newport laser system will allow consistency across various experiments within the Group and apply the currently functioning software and techniques across multiple laser experiments currently ongoing, and in development within the group. Additionally, procuring this system will allow for continued benefit from previous experiments gained working with the same Newport ECDL systems, and minimize training time for new researchers and postdoctoral fellows.</p>
<p>The system must consist of the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	A tuning range of 1975nm to 2075nm, or better<br />&bull;	Continuous, mode-hop free motored tuning over the entire tuning range<br />&bull;	Laser linewidth &lt;200 kHz at 50 &mu;s<br />&bull;	Output power of 2 mW or better<br />&bull;	Fast current modulation (DC coupled)<br />&bull;	Included fiber collimator with &gt;1 mW in fiber<br />&bull;	Attached fiber optic must be a PANDA PM fiber with narrow key FC/APC connectors with the slow axis aligned with the key<br />&bull;	Ability to tune laser from front panel<br />&bull;	USB or serial interface to PC<br />&bull;	Continuous wave (CW) output</p>
<p>Market Research has shown that Newport Corporation, is the sole company that can provide the Tunable ECDL system that is compatibility and inter-operable with existing Newport laser systems.</p>
<p>Given these facts, Newport Corporation is the only source reasonably available to provide the required instrument.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 9/11/2018@ 9:00 am EST, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Although an NMR waiver has been obtained, it must be emphasized this waiver does not waive other legal requirements applicable to the Berry Amendment or the Buy American Act.
 Moreover, the individual NMR waiver does not change the definition of a small nonmanufacturer.  Nonmanufacturers must have 500 or fewer employees to be considered a small business.
Subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Solicitation for Information of Planning Purpose, this announcement constitutes a request for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. This RFI should not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.
Responses to this Request for Information shall include the following information in this format:
1.	Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address.
2.	Contractor and Government Entity Cage (CAGE) Code
3.	How many employees are employed under the company 
4.	Statement indicating your interest in participating 
5.	Comments or feedback concerning the applicability of the nonmanufacturer rule waiver and the 500 employee size standard as solicitation N0018918R0007 is set aside for small business competition
6.	Capability statement displaying the contractorâ€™s ability to provide the minimum requirements, to include past performance information.
 If past performance information is provided, please include only relevant past performance on the same/similar work within the last 5 years.

<p>I. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL) is seeking information on commercially available digital forensics hardware and software tools to meet the needs of emergency responders and protective services.</p>
<p>This information is being sought for the DHS Science and Technology Directorate's System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. The SAVER program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercially available equipment and systems and develops knowledge products that provide relevant equipment information to the emergency responder community. Information provided by the SAVER program will be shared nationally with the responder community, providing a life- and cost-saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders. For more information on the SAVER program, visit the SAVER website at https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/saver.</p>
<p>SAVER provides information on equipment that falls within the categories listed in the DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL). The AEL item number for the subject equipment is FEMA AEL Number 05HS-00-FRNS, Software, Forensic. The target audience for this information is emergency response personnel, law enforcement officials, public safety providers, and their purchasing agents. <br /><br />II. SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>Respondents are required to complete a written Product Summary Questionnaire for each product. The questionnaire may be obtained via e-mail from the technical point of contact, Andy Chen, at andy.chen@hq.dhs.gov (see below). The Product Summary Questionnaire includes questions seeking the following specific information: <br /><br />1. Company's name<br />2. Company's address<br />3. Point(s) of contact (name, title, e-mail, and phone number)<br />4. Business type and size (manufacturer or distributor, small or large business)<br />5. Product name, type, description, and specifications<br />6. Cost information (purchase price and General Services Administration [GSA] schedule information).</p>
<p>All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used in SAVER program documentation; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI. <br /><br />Responses to this RFI must be submitted to Andy Chen not later than 4:00 PM EST, September 28, 2018. All technical comments, inquiries, and responses should be directed to Andy Chen via e-mail at andy.chen@hq.dhs.gov; all non-technical questions should be directed to Ms. Sharon Flowers, DHS Contracting Officer, via e-mail at Sharon.Flowers@hq.dhs.gov<br /><br />III. OTHER<br /><br />The submitted information will be evaluated for inclusion in SAVER projects and reports. Determination as to an individual product's suitability will be made by NUSTL based on the objectives of this request. Therefore, requests for feedback should not be made through the Federal Business Opportunities posting agency. Vendors may be contacted following submission for more detailed product information. Vendor provided information may be reformatted for publication in SAVER program documents.<br />&nbsp;<br />This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Submission of vendor information constitutes consent to publication of that information in SAVER program documentation.</p>
