<p>3. Submission requirements:<br />&bull; Submit up to five (5) relevant projects designs complete or substantially completed within the past five (5) years that best demonstrates your relevant experience to the synopsis requirements. Firm is at risk of receiving a lower rating if fewer than five (5) relevant projects are submitted.

Firms are however limited to no more than five (5) Past Performance Questionnaires total. Ratings will not be affected by a firm that supplies more questionnaires than another. The number of ratings merely helps to clarify a firm's true past performance record.</p>
<p>4. Basis of Evaluation: <br />&bull; Failure to provide requested data or to provide an accessible point of contact (POC) may negatively impact a firm's rating. <br />&bull; The evaluation of past performance will include but is not limited to the assessment of the firm's commitment to customer satisfaction, timely delivery of quality work, the firm's record of conforming to specifications, successful implementation of quality control procedures; adherence to schedules; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior. <br />&bull; Firms unable to demonstrate proven competence to perform projects similar to the requirements of the synopsis may be considered ineligible for award. <br />&bull; Evaluating past performance may include information provided by the firm, inquiries with previous customers, Government databases [Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)], and any other publicly available sources. <br />&bull; While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance, experience, and safety information rests with the firm. <br />&bull; Higher ratings for this may be given when a proposal demonstrates: <br />&#61607; Excellent or very good ratings for past performance and customer satisfaction on projects relevant to the synopsis or;<br />&#61607; Demonstration of specific work within the Department of Defense Agencies, with the highest rating given to work with Department of the Air Force.</p>

Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Current qualified sources are:  Parker-Hannifin (Cage: 82106), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.

<DESC>The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 6 (NAMRU-6) in Peru is evaluating the development of an effective prophylactic to control enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) caused diarrhea. Individual vaccine candidates are being evaluated in an established Aotus nancymaae preclinical model of diarrhea. Continued used of the A. nancymaae monkey in these studies is essential for comparative analysis across studies and maintenance of an established model of disease.
<p>Background: Non-human primate models of human diarrheal diseases caused by ETEC, Campylobacter and Shigella have been developed at NAMRU6 using A. nancymaae. These models represent a unique asset to test the efficacy of vaccines targeting enteric diseases. To date, candidate vaccines against individual strains of ETEC have been tested in the Aotus non-human primate model. We will now test the protective efficacy of a human anti-ETEC antibody product using the Aotus nancymaae model for diarrhea caused by a CFA/I expressing ETEC strain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For the completion of these studies, we shall require&nbsp;39 Aotus Nancymaae (Owl Monkeys) non-human primates. All animals shall be of good health. For the scientific consistency and comparative analysis, the delivered Aotus Nancymaae animals must have an equal gender distribution (in so much as possible) and be at 12 months of age and weighing over &gt;700 grams at the time of the initiation of the study.<br /><br />Delivery: November 20 2017 at NAMRU-6 Facilities in Lima Peru.<br /><br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, then NAMRU 6 intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) to The Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura (IVITA), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima Peru, for the requirements of the collaborative effort with NAMRU-6. <br />The Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones Tropicales y de Altura (IVITA), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos maintains a large, closed colony of Aotus nancymae (owl monkeys) which are made available for research purposes. This species is the principal animal research model for several infectious diseases of interest to our unit's mission. This source is selected for the following reasons:<br />1. Known health status and genetic composition of the colony. Animals from wild-caught sources in the Amazon basin, because of their unknown health history and parasite burden, are not desirable for biomedical research. Also, the use of the captive-bred population at IVITA negates any impact of acquisition on wild populations of animals and eliminates the possibility of inadvertently supporting the illicit trade of animals.<br />2. Use of this source eliminates the additional cost and administrative burden required to obtain permits required by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as the shipment does not cross an international boundary.<br />3. Our institution has used this source for its primate purchases over the past 10 years and a considerable body of our research data is based on the use of this animal source. Changing that source will adversely affect the diarrheal model previously established over the past 10 years through potential changes in incidences of disease, and a changing source will make comparisons with historical data impossible.<br />4. Acquisition within Peru eliminates the transportation stress to the animals associated with extended air travel (relatively short transport by air from Iquitos to Lima). The reduction in transportation associated stress results in decreased requirements for acclimation to the new housing arrangement and greatly reduced rates of stress-induced diarrhea.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 12:00 AM Local Time,&nbsp;October 27th, 2017. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: Javier.b.gil.fn@mail.mil Please use subject line "N44852_AOTUS_39".</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to award a purchase order toAlliance Pharma Inc. for Sample analysis of 48 total samples to quantify ManNAc and Neu5Ac.
<p>The Nationall Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, &amp; Kidney Diseases is currently conducting a clinical trial entitled "A Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of ManNAc in Subjects with Primary Podocyte Diseases " (16-DK-0036 ; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NTC02639260). ManNAc is converted inside cells to sialic acid (Neu5Ac). The basis for this clinical trial is that there is evidence that some subjects with primary glomerular diseases do not put enough sialic acids on glomerular proteins and so ManNAc therapy may increase sialic acid production and sialylation of glomerular proteins in these subjects. For this clinical trial, it is important that concentrations of ManNAc and sialic acid (Neu5Ac) will be measured in plasma at various times before and after oral dosing of ManNAc. These results will inform about the absorption of ManNAc by the GI tract/cells and the subsequent production of sialic acid in subjects with primary glomerular diseases.</p>
<p>Alliance Pharma developed validated (per FDA guidelines) LC/MSMS assays to measure ManNAc and Neu5Ac in plasma. We have been working with this company since the start of this trial and they have already performed these assays for 4 subjects under a different contract.&nbsp; The purpose of this project is to provide analysis of the compounds ManNAc and Neu5Ac.</p>
<p>In compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   It is anticipated that the RFQ NIH-NICHD-18-001 will be available fifteen (15 days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.

<DESC><p>The Government is conducting Full and Open market research to identify potential sources that possess the repair data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to perform depot repair of avionics components for use by the APY-1/2 surveillance radar system applicable to the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. Items for repair are National Stock Number (NSN) 5996010676729CW, part number (PN) 582R171A04 Radio Frequency Amplifier (3 each); NSN 5841011178555, PN 690R247G01 Receiver Subassembly (4 each); NSN 5841015975751CW, PN 707R158G02 Phase Shifter Driver Unit (PSDU) (2 each); and NSN 5841014520822, PN 3D60706G01 Radar Set Subassembly (2 each). Potential sources must possess the ability to repair, test, and provide fully functional APY-1/2 units meeting the E-3 AWACS specifications and requirements.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition strategy is a one-time repair contract planned for award in the 2018 calendar year depending on funding approval. The proposed services are required to repair the APY-1/2 components and are expected to provide the United States Air Force (USAF) with a sustainable and affordable solution to support the AWACS platform.</p>
<p>The APY-1/2 radar system is mounted in the E-3 aircraft fuselage and the rotating radar dome mounted above the aircraft and provides surveillance and situational awareness for the aircrew operators. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811219. The Repair Method Code/Repair Method Supply Code (RMC/RMSC) for these NSNs is R3/R: Repair, for the second or subsequent time directly from the actual manufacturer. The Government does not own the data or rights to the data needed for contract repair of these parts from alternate sources. It has been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer these radar components. This code is used when the Government did not initially purchase the data and/or rights. If only one source has the data rights to repair these components, RMCs 3, 4, or 5 are valid. If two or more sources have the data rights for repair then RMCs 1 or 2 are valid. The data for this repair effort was determined to be the property of the Westinghouse Corp, now Northrop Grumman Systems Corp, CAGE 97942. The Government has determined that these NSNs are non-commercial items. The level of security clearance required is SECRET for access to or generation of data and reports.</p>
<p>There are no hardware samples available for potential repair contractors to evaluate. If necessary, potential contractors shall furnish all material, support equipment, tools, test equipment and services needed to fill this order. The contractor is responsible for providing, maintaining, and calibrating all support equipment required at their facility or a subcontractor's facility. Contractor furnished material or parts used for repair shall equal or exceed the quality of the original material or parts and meet counterfeit prevention plan guidelines as outlined in Data Item Description, DI-MISC-81832.</p>
<p>Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. The following company has been identified as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the APY-1/2 radar system.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation<br />1580A W Nursery Rd<br />Linthicum Heights MD 21090-2202<br />CAGE: 97942</p>

Veterans Health Affairs, Network Contracting Office 5, is issuing this request for information/sources sought notice in order to identify sources that have the resources and capabilities to provide the following services:
Summary of Needs for Contracting to Support
ORH-funded WHS Clinical Skills Training in Women Veteran Health Care Training initiative
Background
The VHA patient population of women Veterans is growing rapidly. Such growth brings increasing demand for high quality gender-specific health care. Approximately 26% of enrolled women Veterans reside in rural and highly rural areas of the county, areas in need of more trained primary care providers who are also designated as Women s Health Primary Providers (WH-PCP) as well as nursing staff trained in women s health. 
WHS has developed and delivered a comprehensive education and training model called the Women s Health Mini-Residency since 2008 for clinical staff to address gaps in knowledge and skills in women s health topics.  This model has been adapted into a blended learning approach providing online lecture content in advance of an onsite, face-to-face 1-day mini-residency training program delivered at rural VHA clinic training sites. 
Description of Needs
Physician and Nurse Instructors
WHS is seeking professional services of physician (MD/DO) and nurse (RN) instructors to deliver the 1-day training to VHA primary care providers (MD/DO, NP, PA) and nurses (RN, LPN/LVN).  This includes small group case facilitation on women s health topics and instruction for hands-on simulation activities focused on breast and pelvic exam preparation, support and exam technique in a multi-site training program at rural and VHA clinic sites.  One (1) physician instructor and one (1) nurse instructor are required for instruction at each training site.  Each training site will have 2-12 VHA primary care provider and nurse participants.  All curricular content, materials, and equipment used in the training will be provided by WHS as Government Furnished Information (GFI) and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Travel of physician and nurse instructors to the training sites will be required.  
Equipment and Set-up Support 
WHS is also seeking services of an individual to support all aspects of GFE used in each 1-day training. This includes facilitating transportation to/from training sites, onsite set-up and break-down, packing and preparation for receiving and shipping.  Onsite assistance to support training activities will be required. GFE includes simulation equipment such as breast and pelvic task trainer models, consumable items such as gynecologic supplies, and AV equipment such as laptops and projector.  Travel of this individual to support equipment and set-up needs to the training sites will be required.  Equipment and set-up support must be provided from an individual separate from the physician and/or nurse instructors.
Timeframe
Contracts submission in time sufficient for contract award by Jan 2018
Training program to start approximately April 2018 and last for a calendar year with two (2) option years thereafter
Location
Rural VHA clinic training sites within continental U.S. will be identified by WHS.  In the first year, tentative training sites are anticipated in western Oregon, northern California, western Nevada, central Kansas, central South Carolina, southeastern Ohio and western New York (subject to change). Training sites in option years thereafter are TBD.
Up to 30-40 training sites are planned each for calendar year starting approximately April 2018

<CONTACT>Rene Brown, Phone 732-323-2780, Fax 732-323-2359, Email rene.brown@navy.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information. <br />The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting information from industry in order to identify airfield lighting manufacturers capable of producing airfield lighting to be integrated into the US Marine Corps Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Legacy Hardwired Lighting System. The EAF Legacy Hardwired Lighting System has been in service for over 30 years. The legacy Constant Current Regulators (CCR) are nearing a point of technological obsolescence, leading to capability gaps and an inability of continued support. In order to address these issues, while still accomplishing the mission, NAVAIR is considering integrating modern CCRs with the legacy high intensity runway edge and threshold lights to support airfield operations. Broad industry participation is desired but NAVAIR is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or near production. Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the Government.<br />1. PURPOSE: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request that is properly marked will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.<br />2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed EAF requirements<br />3. BACKGROUND: The mission of the NAVAIR EAF program is to equip the US Marine Corps to support Naval Aviation with the flexibility and capability to rapidly deploy and establish survivable, self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments. The EAF Concept is a shore-based, aviation weapons support system which permits deployment of landing force aircraft within effective range of ground forces. This concept allows for the construction of portable, reusable, forward-deployed airfields that can be assembled in a building block concept for the rapid introduction of air power. The EAF family of systems supports a myriad of airfield configurations, ranging in size and complexity from single-aircraft vertical take-off and landing sites, to short runways for tactical aircraft, to extended runways for heavy cargo lift, through the deployment of airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, airfield terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. The EAF Legacy Hardwired Lighting System has been in service for over 30 years. The approach and strobe light subsystems are nearing a point of technological obsolescence, leading to capability gaps and an inability of continued support.
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: Legacy EAF CCRs utilize Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) power transformation and are similar to FAA Type L-828 Classes 2 and 1 in performance, except that instead of providing discrete intensity steps, output is infinitely variable between 7.5 and 20 amps (for 15-kilowatt model) or 2.5 and 6.6 amps (for 4-kilowatt model) through use of a potentiometer-based control circuit. <br />It is desired that future CCRs produce a sinusoidal waveform with amplitude adjustment to control the legacy incandescent lamps via isolation transformers, and also have the capability of transmitting powerline communications, such as Frequency Shift Keying, to allow for independent control of dual-source lighting elements (such as, but not limited to, visible and infrared) in the future. Desired output current of the CCR shall be adjustable to 20 amps. The CCR shall be shall be suitable for operation from 120/208 VAC, 3 -phase, 50/60 Hz electrical sources.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Submit your response in a Microsoft&reg; Word or compatible format document in no more than twenty single-sided, single-spaced pages, 12-point, Times New Roman font, using a minimum of one-inch margins.</p>

<DESC><p><br />Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p>N64498-15-RFI-5153</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE is being issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division (NSWCPD). NSWCPD has a requirement to procure hardware items in support of Navigation and Ship Control Systems currently installed on the following multiple classes: CVN; MCM, LSD; LPD; LHA; and LHD. It is the Government's intention to procure these hardware items, utilizing other than full and open competition, from Rocky Research IAW FAR 6.302-1, as only Rock Research meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Rocky Research hardware is required to ensure continued operational capability of numerous critical systems aboard aircraft carriers and other surface combatants. Rocky Research, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is the sole designer and fabricator of this equipment, and, as such, is the only contractor with the complete technical data necessary to furnish the required hardware. No other firm possesses the prerequisite technical data as this information is proprietary to Rocky Research. The Government does not possess full legal rights to the technical data. Only Rocky Research possesses full legal rights to this information. Based on above, Rocky Research is the only contractor which qualifies to perform the efforts associated with the specifications under this requirement.</p>
<p>Rocky Research is not willing to sell complete technical data and software source codes to the Government since most of the equipment has been developed for the Navy by modifying Commercial-Off-The-Shelf hardware.</p>
<p>Access to this information is required to continue the support of the Rocky Research equipment currently in use on highly critical Navigation and Ship Control systems installed in the fleet.</p>
<p>Without direct access to Rocky Research for their hardware and engineering knowledge, there is a high risk that the currently installed systems will suffer from inadequate support and eventual failure. Serious issues, such as the inaccurate targeting of combat systems equipment and the safety of navigation with regards to steering control, could arise if the necessary support was not in place.</p>
<p>Certification efforts have been completed using the Rocky Research hardware specified. Including Combat Systems Integration, Steering Control and Navigation Qualifications. Modifying the hardware that has already been certified will cause recertification efforts to occur, costing the Navy approximately $3,000,000 in total potential requalification efforts. This cost impact is related to the additional funding required to procure and test new hardware equipment, as well as accounting for the amount of labor expended to develop and qualify the associated systems and components. It is estimated that the time required for another vendor to produce products that meet the required certifications is 36 months, which is unacceptable to meet U.S. Navy ship installation schedules.</p>
<p>. NSWCPD intends to issue a solicitation to the specified vendor to meet mission requirements. Prior to issuing a brand name only solicitation, NSWCPD is requesting information in order to make an informed determination regarding procurement strategy. A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES: Responses shall include specific details regarding the ability to provide the required hardware items to meet the needs of the Government. Responses shall discuss how your product/service will meet the requirements found in the SOW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses are not to exceed more than 10 pages. Responses shall be in electronic format. A cover page for the response shall be included. The cover page shall include the company name, address, CAGE Code, Business Size Status for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of this RFI and points of contract (names, email, and telephone numbers) at a minimum. The cover page is not considered in the total page count.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSWCPD will accept only electronic unclassified submission of responses. Responses shall be sent to Michael Woody at michael.woody1@navy.mil with the subject line " RFI N64498-15-R-5153" All responses shall be unclassified and submitted by no later than 18:00 on 10 November 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This RFI is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. The Government is NOT seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. This RFI Notice is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI, and the Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the response to this RFI. The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is conducting a market survey for maintenance and repairs to the North Jetty feature of the Federal Navigation Project in Scituate Harbor, Scituate, Massachusetts. This announcement is to determine the interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns in this project as described below. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued on or about December 2017. The construction period for the project is anticipated to be early spring 2018. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00
<p>The work of this project consists of repairing several sections of the North Jetty at Scituate Harbor. The nose of the north jetty (i.e. seaward end) along with other smaller areas along the structure were damaged during Winter Storm Juno in 2015 and subsequent storms. Approximately 2,000 tons of new armor stone will be required to make repairs to the nose section of the jetty. The new armor stones will vary in size from 6-8 tons. The work includes dismantling, removing, stockpiling, reworking and reinstalling existing armor stone as well as acquiring and installing new armor in the jetty repair areas. The repaired areas must be properly interlocked and be within specified design tolerances. The new armor stones will be required to be delivered via waterborne plant and placed upon the shore behind the State spur jetty for further placement into the structure. No over the road transport of stones will be allowed. Due to significant eelgrass beds adjacent to the structure in the interior of the harbor, stone placement work will be required to be performed from the top of the structure.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) and what type of equipment the firm is proposing to use. Firms must submit documented information that demonstrates experience with a minimum of two examples of construction projects, similar in scope and magnitude to this project that the firm has successfully performed in the last six years. The examples must clearly demonstrate breakwater or jetty repair projects (or other stone work in a marine environment) beyond typical earthwork construction and demonstrate experience with acquiring and placing large armor stones (up to 10 tons) with both land and marine equipment; the ability and capability of simultaneously performing this work by land and barge and demonstrate experience in working in a dynamic and restricted marine environment (ocean waves, tides, time of year, etc.); Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on stone structures.</p>
<p>Please indicate your team subcontractors that will be used to support your effort and include their prior experience and qualifications. Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are due November 1, 2017. Responses should be sent electronically to Elizabeth Glasgow, Contract Specialist at elizabeth.k.glasgow@usace.army.mil. Responses are limited to twenty pages. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.</p>

Stops will be made at Little Goose and Lower Monumental dams to load additional fish or to pick up an additional fish barge for transport to the release site. The initiation of barging operations is based on runoff projections. During years when runoff is forecasted to be near or above normal or average runoff, barging of fish could begin as late as May 1. During low flow or drought years, barging of fish may begin as early as 21 April. Transporting of fish by barge from Snake River dams will therefore begin sometime between April 21 and May 1, as directed by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative, and should last until approximately mid-August. The Contractor will routinely transport a loaded fish barge from Lower Granite Dam, stop and pick up a loaded fish barge at Little Goose Dam, and then continue on the trip downstream to the release site. <br /><br />During the 2018 transport season and possibly the 2019 transport season, fish transportation during the month of May may take place once per day for up to 31 barge trips. From June through mid-August fish transportation would take place every other day for up to 40 barge trips. In addition, during the 2018 transport season and possibly the 2019 transport season, up to 4 barge trips may take place once per week during the month of April in support of fish research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Offerors are hereby notified that the Request for Proposal (RFP) N00024-17-R-6308 for the Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) requirement has been posted.</p>
<p>Information related to the XLUUV requirement was previously posted under notice: Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) Presolicitation Notice (https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=721b725bc9de88727da6552c8d79339e&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1).

All Architects and Engineers (A-E), including subcontractors, are cautioned to review the restrictions of FAR 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest and 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms. Any A-E, including subcontractors, that prepares a Design-Build Request for Proposal for a particular project will be restricted from participating in any contractor task order for the Design-Build of that particular project. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and if requested other Corps of Engineers Districts. Typically, the contract will be for one basic ordering period (three years) and one option period (two years) with a total contract limit of five years or $20,000,000. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. Task Orders will be primarily for large projects with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330 size standard $15.0 million. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.

If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 219.7004 as part of the Request for Proposal package. The following subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan to meet the Savannah District small business targets. Of the subcontracted work, 50% of the work would go to small business; 17% to small disadvantaged business (a composite of small business); 18% to women-owned business (a composite of small business); 10% to HUBZone small business (a composite of small business); 4% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business and veteran-owned small business); and 8.5% to Veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business). The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFARs Subpart 5119.7 and AFARS Appendix DD. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

AMENDMENT (A00001) OF RFQ VA262-17-Q-2037   CONTRACT MONITOR TECHNICIANS; VALBHS

Q: For Factor 2 - Past Performance, will the VA accept past performance of key personnel rather than past performance of the business?

A: No, the past performance of a business will be the only factor evaluated. 

The current proposed NAICS code is 561320 Temporary Help Services. The 2017 NAICS code definition for 561320 is:  establishments primarily engaged in supplying workers to clients' businesses for limited periods of time to supplement the working force of the client. The individuals provided are employees of the temporary help services establishment. However, these establishments do not provide direct supervision of their employees at the clients' work sites.   https://www.census.gov/cgibin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?input=561320&search=2017+NAICS+Search&search=2017

This contract is for one year, with 3 one-year options, with an annual hour allotment of 20,800 Hours (83,200 cumulative); by definition this service cannot be considered or categorized as  temporary  by the federal government, nor will the resultant Technicians be providing services to the VA for  limited periods of time . 

 We respectfully request the Long Beach VA re-examine the NAICS code with its SB liaison. Q: Can the NAICS code be changed to the more appropriate NAICS Code 621999 - Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services? (which is defined as  establishments primarily engaged in providing ambulatory health care services (except offices of physicians, dentists, and other health practitioners; outpatient care centers; medical and diagnostic laboratories; home health care providers; ambulances; and blood and organ banks)).   https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch

 Further support for the 621999 NAICS code grouping, comes from the ONET portal as these technician belong to the 621 category  Health Care and Social Assistance  grouping, as supported by the multitude of cross-reference labor codes and definitions:  https://www.onetcodeconnector.org/ccreport/29-2031.00. 

A: After re-examination, NAICS code 561320 is the appropriate NAICS code for this acquisition. Personnel are required on an as-needed basis to supplement existing VALBHS staff. The requirement of 20,800 hours is the estimate needed for the base year of the IDIQ Contract only. 

Changes to the Schedule of Service and Price will be amended to be as follows:

Per B.5 of the solicitation: 

#1 -  There is a there is a  Call  requirement, Contract Monitor Technician providers shall reside within commuting distance of the VALBHS (within 50 miles).  

#19.3 -  Contract Monitor Technicians shall be available to work 24/7; including holidays, and shall participate in call coverage a minimum of two (2) weeks per month.  

 There is nothing in the solicitation that explains the call requirement or on-call process, nor is there any line item for on-call rate billing. Q: Can you please provide a detailed explanation to the on-call portion of this requirement and what the process will be for the organization that wins this contract, the monitor techs that are providing services, and how it affects the scheduling and billing for providers? 

A: Contract Monitor Technicians are scheduled in advance on the bi-weekly unit work schedule. The VALBHS requires the contractor to find coverage when a contractor is unexpectedly unable to report for duty. The VALBHS may also call the contractor in an attempt to find coverage when VALBHS staff is unexpectedly unable to report for duty, but does not expect the vendor to guarantee availability to cover VALBHS staff call-outs. 

Consequently, the language of  call  and  on-call  as well as  Contract Monitor Technician providers shall reside within commuting distance of the VALBHS (within 50 miles) will be removed. 

The remaining language will state,  Contract Monitor Technicians shall be available to work 24-7.  

Q: Can you please provide the current contract number for which these services are being provided by AHP, and the current number of hours and FTEs attached to the contract? 

A: Current FSS Contract V797D-40320; Task Order VA262-17-F-4237. The period of performance is for four (4) months in an estimated quantity of 17,410 hours for Contract Monitor Technician services. 

Per B.5 #2 Monitor Technicians are also referred to as  EKG Monitor Technicians  which corresponds with the SCA Code 12030 EKG Technicians attached to the solicitation. In order for pricing and competition to be level amongst the responding organizations, please confirm that the VA is categorizing these services as SCA code 12030 EKG Technicians with a minimum $30.63 hourly rate, as there are no other relevant codes that correspond. Q: If the VA is not categorizing these technicians under the 12030 SCA Code, can you please advise the appropriate code? 

A: SCA code 12030 for EKG Technicians with a minimum $30.63 hourly rate will be utilized. 

Q: In reference to the solicitation "10 FTE-EQUIVALENT MONITOR TECHNICIANS Sol No. VA26217Q2037", the SF 1449 states due date as Oct 25, 2017, but FBO states due date is Oct 20, 2017. Is Oct 25, 2017 the correct due date?

A: The Offer due date will be amended via RFQ VA262-17-Q-2037 as A00001 to October 27, 2017 (10-27-2017) for 12:00 Noon, PST. 

On page 52 of 88 in the solicitation under item 12030 the wage determination amount is listed for EKG Technicians as $30.63. Q: Can you please confirm that this amount; $30.63 is the correct wage determination amount for an EKG Monitor Technician?

A: The wage determination listed for EKG Technicians under Section D.1 of the solicitation is the most current and up to date wage determination for the California county of Los Angeles. 
 
On page 44 of 88 of the solicitation, it is stated that FAR clause 52.222-17, Non-displacement of Qualified Workers is applicable to this contract award. Q: Is there currently EKG monitor technicians performing work that would need to be considered upon award of this contract?

A: Yes, see the answer for question 4. 

Q: Can the contracting team please confirm that it is anticipated that work will be performed "on-site" at the VA Tibor Rubin Medical Center at 5901 E 7th St. Long Beach, CA  90822?

A: Yes, the Contract Monitor Technician work will be performed on-site at the VA Tibor Rubin Medical Center at 5901 E 7th St. Long Beach, CA  90822. 

On pages 10 - 11 of 88 in the solicitation the contracting team states that employees could be drug tested on-site, but it does not specify whether or not employees need to be drug tested prior to starting work. Q: As this is a common requirement, we anticipate that employees should be drug tested prior to starting work; can the contracting team please confirm this requirement?

A: Yes, employees will be drug tested prior to starting work. 

Related to the on-boarding of employees, can the VA please outline what specifically what they are looking for in terms of background checks? We acknowledge the HHS/OIG Requirement listed as item 15, and the VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and security Program, but are unable to find specifics in regards to what tier monitor technicians are classified as, and what level of background checks will be required prior to approval and starting work. Q: Can you please clarify? 
A: A National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) is the minimum level of investigation required of federal employees as a condition of employment with the federal government. This investigation is appropriate for positions designated as public trust positions that require responsible and trustworthy employees, but with no national security impact such as Contract Monitor Technicians. 

The solicitation likewise references liability insurance on pages 49 and 50 of 88 in the solicitation. Q: Is the VA able to comment in any further degree of specificity regarding liability insurance requirements beyond the $1,000,000 limit? 

A: In accordance with VAAR 852.237-7 Indemnification and Medical Liability Insurance the following minimum liability insurance coverage levels shall apply to this contract:

General Liability of not less than:  $1,000,000.00 per occurrence.

The Contractor must present to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, evidence of general liability insurance without any exclusionary clauses that would void the general liability coverage. 

Q: Can the contracting team please state what the dress code requirements for the employees will be? 

A: (see below)

Personal Hygiene and Appearance. Contract Monitor Technician staff shall be neat, clean, well-groomed, and shall otherwise exercise good personal hygiene. Appropriate and professional attire shall be worn at all times; a laboratory style coat must be worn over scrubs when Contract Monitor technician staff is not performing duties in a clinical examination area, emergency or procedure rooms. Medical scrubs are not to be worn outside the facility.

Identification Badge. An identification (ID) badge will be issued by the VALBHS to Contract Monitor Technician staff providing services under the contract. The appropriate ID badge shall be worn at all times while on Government facility grounds, clearly displayed on the outermost garment (i.e., scrubs, coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, blouse, lab coat etc.).

On page 65 of the solicitation, under the General Instructions for Bidders, the solicitation refers to a CD being included with the submitted responses. Q: Would a thumb drive also be acceptable?

A: Yes, a thumb drive is acceptable. 

Q: Where the solicitation has been released as an IDIQ contract, is it anticipated that additional employees beyond the initial 10 EKG Monitor Technicians will be required? 

A: No, it is not anticipated additional employees beyond the initial 10 will be required. 

Q: Can the contracting team please provide a current job description for the telemetry (EKG) monitoring technician position?

A: Telemetry monitor technicians are primarily responsible for noting changes in the condition of patients via continuous monitoring of EKG records on a central station monitor, as well as admitting and discharging patient from monitoring equipment and ensuring all telemetry boxes are returned and cleaned per hospital policy upon patient discharge. Technicians are also responsible for alerting appropriate clinical providers of changes in patient condition which require assessment, and proper preparation of documentation of patient statuses for placement into patient records.

On page 65 of the formal solicitation section (b)(i) it indicates that a CD with an electronic version of the offer needs to be included as part of the proposal. It then states in section (c); three paragraphs down that the priceless shall also be included on a compact disk. Considering the granularity of the proposal submission and formatting requirements we'd like to confirm that a pricelist needs to be submitted on a separate CD. Q: Is that correct?

A: Yes, please include the pricelist on a separate CD (or thumb drive per question 14). 

Q: Will the Post-Award Conference be conducted on-site or via conference call?

A: Unknown at this time. 

Q: Can you please provide the OT historical utilization averages on a daily, weekly, and month basis? 

A: Unknown at this time.

A: Estimated 10 contract monitor technicians multiplied (x) by an estimated 2,080 hours per technician = estimated 20,080 hours.  

10 x 2,080 = 20,800 hours (estimated) 

Q: Who prepares the scheduling of routine, OT, and on-call coverage requirements?

A: The Nursing Supervisor of the assigned work area is responsible for the scheduling of contract personnel, including routine shifts and OT. On-Call scheduling is not used for contract monitor technicians.

A: Facility will only consider resumes and may request to conduct interviews with potential candidates on a case by case basis.  

Q: What is the on-boarding turn-around time from point of candidate profile acceptance by the facility?

A: Depending on background processing times at national program office, turn-around time is approximately 30-60 days. 

Based on the minimum of eight (8) and maximum of ten (10) candidate profiles required with submission of bid response Q: what is the number of techs (beyond the 10 FTEs, if any) that the Facility will review and approve as back-up/replacement provider staff?

A: The facility does not have a requirement in terms of a number of contractors to be reviewed/approved for back up staff. The number of back up staff needed may fluctuate based on the availability of Contract Monitor Technicians accepted from the contractor. Facility will request profiles for back up staff based on the ability of the contractor to cover requested shifts.

Q: What is the frequency of Holiday rotation for the existing staff (and what FTE count is that based on   i.e., 17, 10, etc.)?

A: Unknown at this time. 

 Holiday pay is not authorized  Q: Does CA Department of Labor require an OT Pay rate for any worker providing services on any of the ten (10) national holidays?

A: Hours worked on holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays are treated like hours worked on any other day of the week. California law does not require that an employer provide its employees with paid holidays, that it close its business on any holiday, or that employees be given the day off for any particular holiday. If an employer closes its business on holidays and gives its employees time off from work with pay, such a circumstance exists pursuant to a policy or practice adopted by the employer, pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, or pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement between the employer and employee, as there is nothing in the law that requires such a practice. Additionally, there is nothing in the law that mandates an employer pay an employee a special premium for work performed on a holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, other than the overtime premium required for work performed in excess of eight hours in a workday or 40 hours in a workweek.

Per the State of California website at http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_Holidays.htm  

Q: Must all specified Training requirements (specified within this section and previously mentioned within the Solicitation) be completed prior to the candidate commencing services, or are these training requirements completed on the first day of assignment?

A: All specified training requirements must be completed prior to the commencement of services. 

In the interest of providing continuity of service and recognizing this Right of First Refusal pertains to  Government Personnel.  Q: how soon after contract award will the Government provide new incoming contractor information like the listing of names and numbers of contracted incumbent staff the Facility would like to retain?

A: This information will be disseminated in conjunction with the COR and contracted incumbent staff upon contract award(s). 

Based on this IDIQ procurement model will additional Task Orders be applied to this contract over and beyond the ten (1) FTEs and On-Call Staff?

A: It is unlikely there will be over 10 contract monitor technicians staffed at the VALBHS. 

Q: Is a formal Phase-in/Phase-out Plan required as part of the bid response submission?

A: Formal phase-in/out is not required.

Q: Can you kindly advise as to which Occupational Code and Title is recognized by the Facility for the hiring of the Monitor Techs? 

A: SCA code 12030 for EKG Technicians with a minimum $30.63 hourly rate will be utilized.

Q: Will the Facility authorize EPAs to address the incremental increases arising throughout the contract period for Health & Welfare or should that estimated value be calculated in to the pricing proposal?

A: The estimated value of incremental increases should be calculated into the pricing proposal (Section D.1).  

Q: Can you please clarify the Facilities  interpretation as to  pricing will be evaluated based on fairness and reasonableness. 

A: A fair and reasonable price determination assessment by the Government will be conducted so that an offeror s proposed price for the services requested can be considered  fair and reasonable  on the basis of applying one or more price analysis techniques.

There are two different schedules provided in the RFQ: 1) in Section B.4 (p. 7) which asks for overtime rate but doesn t provide hours; and 2) in Section D.1, Price Worksheet (p. 50) that requires unit price and estimated amount for 20,800 hours, but does not address overtime. Q: Which schedule does the Government want completed?

A: The government requests both schedules be completed. Overtime is not given in quantities as all hours are estimates only (IDIQ contract); this includes the provision of overtime. The proposed overtime rate (e.g., 1.2x, 1.3x in accordance with CA state law) is all that is requested. 

Q: Must a candidate resume include references? If so, how many and must they be supervisory or PEER references?

A: Yes, 2-3 references are required. Peer or Supervisory are acceptable, however supervisory are preferred.

Must the candidate resume include exact description as pertinent to each candidate s experience/training regarding the nine (9) Skill Set requirements listed on Page 9, 3.1., or is an addendum to the resume acceptable that would address candidate s capability within each of the listed requirements from this Section within the PWS?

A: No, a standard resume detailing work history and skills is acceptable. 

Q: Can you please verify that based on best-value trade-off evaluation, if all candidate submissions by multiple bidders are equitable in skill set and quality the second ranking factor will then be bidder s Past Performance, and third factor being Price? 

A: Correct please refer to E.4 under BASIS FOR AWARD. Award will be made to a responsible offeror(s) on the basis of a best-value trade-off. The evaluation factors are identified in paragraph 2 (pg. 66) and are listed in descending order of importance.

Q: Can you please clarify specifics regarding the  Call  requirement additionally, can you kindly provide historical hourly utilization on the existing contract of regarding  Call  usage rate?

A: The  Call  usage rate has been nullified and removed from the RFQ. 

Q: Will a pricing CLIN be added for on-call coverage requirements?

A: No, a pricing CLIN will not be added for on-call coverage requirements. 

Q: Will a pricing CLIN be added if an  On-Call  beeper is necessary?

<DESC><p align="left">The objective is to provide quality upgrades to the existing Western Range Command Destruct equipment through procurement of hardware and software that is tri-mode capable Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) with 10 kW transmit power that meet range safety requirements within the timeframe of the National Security Agency (NSA) mandate of 2020. The upgrade of highly specialized equipment will be identical to the recent modernization effort accomplished at the Eastern Range. These new Command Destruct System elements will provide the functionality of the existing Command Destruct System, plus add the new EFTS capability to support Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launches. The EFTS capability is being added because the NSA will no longer support High Alphabet (HA) code generation. The HA capability will exist in the new system as it must be designed to support the transition from HA to EFTS until HA is retired by the NSA.<br /><br />The&nbsp;Prime Mission Equipment (PME) Procurement for the WRCDM Program is being cancelled do to the fact that the wrong version was post on FBO.&nbsp; We will re-post the correct version later sometime this week.</p>

Please see attachements for details<br /><br /><strong>Pre-Solicitation Notice - M205 Tripod</strong><br /><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE of a proposed requirement regarding the M205 Lightweight Tripod (NSN: 1005-01-586-5702) for Heavy Machine Guns. The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey-Soldier Weapons (ACC-NJ-SW) on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW) intends to award a Single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders. The contract will include five (5) ordering periods to cover FY18 - FY22 Army and Department of Defense (DoD) M205 requirements. This requirement is 100% set aside for small business. The anticipated contract minimum is $630,000.00. The anticipated contract maximum is 19,024 M205 tripods. This notice of intent is NOT a request for draft or formal competitive proposals.<br /><br />The M205 Tripod is used with the M2/M2A1 Heavy Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun and will be produced to a Government Technical Data Package (TDP). The M205 is an improved ground mount which will replace the heavier and larger M3 Tripod for ground mounting the M2/M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine Gun and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG). An integral Traverse and Elevation (T&amp;E) Mechanism is included as part of the M205 and provides controlled manipulation in both T&amp;E. The M205's primary mission is to provide a stable, easy to-use, mounting platform for the M2/M2A1 and MK19 for delivering controlled, sustained, and accurate fire at extended ranges to support combat operations in offensive and defensive roles.<br /><br />Any offeror awarded a contract resulting from the solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT). A crucial aspect of FAT is a Live Fire Test requirement to be performed by the successful offeror(s). The Live Fire Test requirement(s) will be solely performed by the contractor. The awardee will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished machineguns,<br />ammunition, and equipment in order to be considered for award. The Firing Test requirement(s) will be outlined and included with the solicitation. The FAT and Lot Acceptance Test requirements will be outlined and included in the solicitation. Should a resulting contract be awarded, the First Article Sample would be submitted to the<br />Government 180 days after contract award, and monthly production deliveries would commence within 60 days after Government approval of the First Article Sample. Production deliveries would ramp up from 50 per month to 400 per month by the sixth (6) delivery. Delivery schedules for future orders will be establish at time of award.<br /><br />The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M205 Tripod is categorized as Distribution D and is restricted accordingly. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.<br />Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level. The manufacture of the M205 Tripod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of<br />the TDP. (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/for instructions and information). At time of the Request for Proposal (RFP), TDP requests shall be submitted in writting using AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire along with a signed DD 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement form, a fully executed Non Disclosure<br />and Non Use Agreement and a fully executed Shipping Request Form. All required documents will be provided at solicitation release. In order to provide the data to foreign subcontractors, offerors must apply for an export license. An offeror's delay in applying for a DD 2345 certification or an export license will not be a basis to extend<br />the closing date of any future request for proposal. Only contractors who have completed and signed the required documents as prescribed in the solicitation will be granted access to the technical data. Drawings will not be provided as part of this PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. At the conclusion of the solicitation process, all respondents in receipt of data will be required to complete a Certificate of Destruction notifying the USG that all data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed.<br /><br />This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<a href="mailto:SRSLiquidWaste@emcbc.doe.gov">Procurement Email Address</a>
<DESC>This notice is considered to be a synopsis in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2 for the Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste Services procurement.
On March 31, 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Environmental Management, issued a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for liquid waste services at SRS.  DOE intends to conduct a pre-solicitation conference, site tour, and industry one-on-one sessions for this procurement during the week of April 18, 2016.  Interested parties are encouraged to review the Draft RFP prior to the pre-solicitation conference, site tour, and industry one-on-one sessions.  Interested parties should continue to monitor the SRS Liquid Waste Services procurement website for specific details at: https://www.emcbc.doe.gov/SEB/SRSLiquidWaste/. 
The SRS Liquid Waste Services include but are not limited to: operations of existing radioactive liquid waste facilities for storage, treatment, stabilization, and disposal of waste; waste removal from tanks and tank closures; construction of additional saltstone disposal units; operation of the Salt Waste Processing Facility after facility commissioning, startup, and one year of operation; and liquid waste program and regulatory support.
Interested parties are encouraged to review the Draft RFP and provide suggestions, comments, questions, and changes in writing by April 29, 2016, to: SRSLiquidWaste@emcbc.doe.gov.  DOE will not respond to or post on the procurement website any oral or written questions or comments pertaining to the Draft RFP; however, DOE will respond to and post questions and answers on the Final RFP after its release.
A dedicated webpage has been established for this procurement.  All news/announcements, documents (including the Draft and Final RFP), questions/answers, pre-solicitation conference information, and related links will be posted to the following webpage: https://www.emcbc.doe.gov/SEB/SRSLiquidWaste/.  The Draft and Final RFP will also be posted to the FedBizOpps and FedConnect websites.
DOE personnel may contact responding firms to clarify comments, proposed changes, questions, and other matters as necessary.  The Draft RFP is NOT a formal request for proposals.  Proposals are NOT being requested in response to the Draft RFP and will NOT be evaluated.
In developing the Final RFP, DOE will consider all comments, proposed changes, and questions received.  DOE tentatively anticipates issuance of the Final RFP, for which proposals will be requested, late in the third quarter of Government fiscal year 2016.  No additional synopsis will be released prior to issuing the Final RFP.  The contract award resulting from the Final RFP is expected to be in or about the 2nd quarter of Government fiscal year 2017.
The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract that includes a hybrid fee structure for both award fee and performance based incentives (PBIs).  The expected total period of performance is ten years, including option years.  This procurement will be 100% full and open competition.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 562910 with a size standard of 750 employees.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item or service using FAR Part 12.

The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contracts, are for a variety of Architect/Engineer services primarily for Air Force Reserve projects nationwide (including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa). Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the Government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.</p>
<p>Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $9,000,000. This is a five year contract, with no option years. The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>Up to five firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between Offerors considered as technically equal. Once selected, the following factors will be used in deciding which selected Offeror will be utilized for task orders: past performance, quality of deliverables, capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience. Estimated start date is March 2018.</p>
<p>As a contract specifically procured by the Louisville District for the Air Force Reserve, the selected firms and relevant sub-consultants will be required to attend one two-day partnering workshop within 12 months of the award of the IDIQ contract. This workshop will require the attendance of representatives from project<br />management, architecture, engineering and interior design disciplines to define the Government's expectations of the offeror, create a positive working atmosphere, encourage open communication, and to identify common goals. Cost for these sessions will be borne by the selected offeror.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $35,000 will receive a performance evaluation. A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for Architect-Engineer Services.</p>
<p>2.) PROJECT INFORMATION: The selected offeror will be solely responsible for the designs that they produce, and will become the designer of record or Design-Build RFP preparer for each individual project on their contract.

<DESC>The Government intents to award a &nbsp;contract pursuant to this solicitation to support Operations and Maintenance of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC). This requirement is being handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Mobile, Alabama.&nbsp; The request for proposal (RFP) number is W91278-17-R-0054.<br /><br />The term of the contract is limited to a base period of 12 months&nbsp;with one (1) option period of 12 months.&nbsp; The total dollar capacity for this contract is estimated to be between $30 million and $49 million.&nbsp;
<p>OBJECTIVE:&nbsp; The O&amp;M contract is intended to provide operation, maintenance and minor repair of medical facilities, healthcare and laboratory (MTFs), in a continuous and satisfactory condition on a 24 hour basis, 7 days per week. Requirements include preventive, predictive, and emergency maintenance of all facility systems and components including architectural, mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation. Minor construction incidental to the O&amp;M mission may also be required. Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of the functional operation relating to the efficient use of the facility, equipment, facility support systems, and building structures. Since the facilities will be in full operation, the contractor will be required to minimize interference with the daily operation of the MTFs and will be required to implement infection control processes. The Contractor will be required to comply with requirements of a number of regulatory and accrediting bodies such as the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The facilities to be covered by the intended contract include Bio-safety Levels (BSL)-2, 3, and 4 research laboratories and laboratory support functions, Animal Bio-safety Levels (ABSL) -2, 3, and 4 animal holding facilities for small and large species to include non-human primates and vivarium facilities, veterinary treatment facilities, public health/analytical laboratories, field laboratories (dry labs), food analysis and diagnostic laboratories, laboratories working with chemical agents, and facilities that use specialized equipment/chambers. MEDCOM laboratories focus on research, development, testing and evaluation of medical products related to health hazards associated with aviation, tactical combat vehicle systems, selected weapons systems, airborne operations, environmental hazards, combat casualty care (trauma, burn and critical care), medical hazards of laser radiation, and exposure to extreme thermal conditions (heat, cold, high terrestrial altitude). The performing contractor's personnel will be required to meet security and health screening requirements. In addition, there may be facilities or portions of facilities that require medical testing and/or immunization of Contractor employees, beyond basic OSHA requirements, before the employees are authorized to work in the controlled room, area, or facility. This requirement may be due to the containment requirements in bioresearch laboratories, the potential for exposure of workers to toxins or communicable diseases, etc. Work may range from reconfiguration of a single room or repair of a single utility system component to renovation of a facility functional area to include both repair of failed and failing systems and components, and minor construction of new systems and components. Joint Commission Environment of Care requirements and other applicable requirements must be met, including maintenance of records of preventive maintenance on all critical systems and compliance with/ implementation of the facility's Utilities Management Plan. This acquisition is for two years to include a base plus one year option with an anticipated value between $30,000,000 and $49,000,000. The requirement is handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Mobile, Alabama. Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around October 2017.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.<br />The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Fort Detrick, MD is the contracting activity.<br />The requiring activity is the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), located at 3650 Chambers Pass, Building 3610, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.<br />The contract action being proposed is the award of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders to provide NAMRU- SA with STA Compact Coagulation-analyzer specific reagents. The proposed source is Diagnostica Stago, 5 Century Drive, Parsippany NJ, 07054. Diagnostica Stago is the only manufacturer of the required products and there are no known distributors.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.<br />These reagents must be compatible with the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments currently in operation at NAMRU-SA. The reagents must be compatible with the positive barcode identification feature of the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments. The use of the positive barcode identification provides the instrument and the user with the reagent name, lot number, expiration date, reagent volume, and on-board stability and allows for the continuous monitoring of these reagent characteristics, which is vital to ensuring that the results of the coagulation analysis will be comparable within an individual project, as well as across studies.</p>
<p>The reagents must be calibrated and validated for the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact<br />coagulation instruments from the manufacturer of the reagents.</p>
<p>The proposed IDIQ contract will provide for the delivery of up to 50 STA Deficient XII assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient XI assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient IX assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient VIII assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient X assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient VII assay (6 x 1mL vials), 50 STA Deficient V assay (6 x 1mL vials), and 50 STA Deficient II assay (6 x 1mL vials). The ordering period for this IDIQ contract is divided into a base and four option periods, each consisting of 12 months, for a total of 60 months (if all options are exercised).</p>

<p>5. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.<br />41 U.S.C. 1901, as implemented by FAR 13.501; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>6. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.<br />Market research was conducted to ascertain what reagents are available in the commercial marketplace that will meet the requirements of the Government, as outlined in section 3.<br /><br />These reagents must be compatible with the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments currently in operation at NAMRU-SA. Diagnostica Stago is the sole source located by market research that produces reagents that are compatible with the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments. The reagents must be calibrated and validated for the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments from the manufacturer of the reagents. Diagnostica Stago is the sole<br />source located by market research that produces reagents that are pre calibrated for use with the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments and have been validated by the manufacturer of the reagents.<br /><br />NAMRU-SA currently has two Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments that support ongoing research in the study of hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock. The Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments are equipped with positive barcode identification for the identification of reagents. The use of the positive barcode identification provides the instrument and the user with the reagent name, lot number, expiration date, reagent volume, and on-board stability and allows for the continuous monitoring of these reagent characteristics, which is vital to ensuring that the results of the coagulation analysis will be comparable within an individual project, as well as across studies. Therefore, the reagents must be compatible with the positive barcode identification feature of the Diagnostica Stago STA Compact coagulation instruments that are currently in operation by NAMRU-SA. Diagnostica Stago is the sole source<br />located by market research that produces reagents that are compatible with the instruments positive barcode identification Market research looked to see Diagnostica Stago, Inc had more than one distributor for the required reagents. Market research did not locate any distributors for Diagnostica Stago, Inc regents except for the OEM manufacturer.<br /><br />Market research located one manufacturer of reagents that will meet the requirements of the Government. Market research determined that Diagnostica Stago, Inc. (the OEM manufacturer of the instruments) is the sole manufacturer of reagents that will meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>7. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.<br />To date, no other sources have written to express and interest in this requirement. NMLC will post a notice of intent (NOI) on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202. Any sources capable of distributing the PromoCell brand stromal cells will receive consideration.</p>
<p>8. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.<br />The Contracting Officer will perform a cost analysis in order to determine that the anticipated cost to the Government of the services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>9. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.<br />For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 6, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the type of services covered by this document. If other potential sources emerge, NMLC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. If future requirements exist that do not involve the same research efforts, the government will solicit through full and open competition to remove barriers.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br />1. Contracting Activity.
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Fort Detrick, MD is the contracting activity. The requiring activity is the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), located at 3650 Chambers Pass, Building 3610, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved. <br /><br />NAMRU-SA has a requirement for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells, human adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells and human umbilical mesenchymal stromal cells. The proposed source is PromoCell GmbH, located at Sickingenstr. 63/65, 69126 Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The proposed IDIQ contract will provide human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells, human adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells and human umbilical mesenchymal stromal cells to continue ongoing studies at NAMRU-SA. The cells must be extracted from their respective tissues using the exact same process and are frozen down at passage one (1), as the stromal cells used in the earlier studies were.</p>
<p>The estimated IDIQ minimum would be two (2) vials of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, two (2) vials of human adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells and two (2) vials of human umbilical mesenchymal stromal cells for a combined minimum of six (6) vials. The estimated minimum is per 12 month period and the IDIQ will not have a guaranteed minimum ordering quantity past the base period.</p>
<p>The estimated IDIQ maximum per 12 month period will be would be 30 vials of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, 30 vials of human adipose derived mesenchymal stromal cells and 30 vials of human umbilical mesenchymal stromal cells for a combined maximum of 90 vials. The IDIQ will not have a guaranteed minimum ordering quantity past the base period.</p>
<p>The cells must be extracted from their respective tissues using the exact same process as the stromal cells used in the earlier studies were.</p>
<p>The cells must be frozen down at passage one (1) or earlier and aliquoted into a 1mL volume of 500,000 cells per vial because stromal cells are capable of differentiating up to passage 4. Beyond passage 4, the cells lose their differentiation ability. Because there is a need to expand out the cells to passage 3 to obtain a sufficient number of cells to differentiate at passage 4, the cells must be delivered having been frozen down at passage 1 or earlier.</p>
<p>The cells must aliquoted into a 1mL volume of 500,000 cells per vial.</p>
<p>The ordering period for this IDIQ contract is divided into a base and four option periods, each consisting of 12 months for a total of 60 months (if all options are exercised). Funding will be provided on the firm fixed price delivery orders and are expected to be FY 2017 Research Development Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds.</p>
<p><br />4. Estimated Dollar Value.</p>
<p>The estimated value of each of the base and option ordering periods is up to $56,390.00. This estimated price includes shipping costs for up to 5 shipments. The total estimated contract value is $281,950.00. The flat rate price for packaging and delivery per shipment is $52.</p>
<p>5. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>41 U.S.C. 1901, (as implemented by FAR 13.501); Brand Name Only</p>
<p>6. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted by the Subject Matter Experts (SME, CDR Sheppard and Dr. Alexander Burdette) at NAMRU-SA. Upon completion of this research, it was determined that amniotic membrane mesenchymal stromal cells are available from multiple sources. However, each company extracts them from their respective tissue in different ways which significantly alters the cell's ability to grow and differentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare, for example, human amniotic membrane mesenchymal stromal cells from company A to human amniotic membrane mesenchymal stromal cells from company B.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this research, it was determined that although stromal cells are available from multiple suppliers, only PromoCell sells the cell type that is required for this project, which were extracted from their respective tissues using the exact same process and are frozen down at passage one (1), as the stromal cells used in the earlier studies were. PromoCell was the sole supplier of stromal cells to the earlier studies.</p>
<p>No stromal cells except those provided by the same company (PromoCell) that provided the cells for the previous research will meet the Governments requirement. The stromal cells to be purchased under this IDIQ will be used to build upon and advance the research conducted in previous studies. PromoCell is the only company that can provide cells compatible with the previous body of historical research and subsequent data that future research will build off of. Any other company's stromal cells are incompatible with the historical data and would require all of the previous research to be re-conducted to establish a body of historical data compatible with a non PromoCell stromal cell. This is impossible due to funding and time constraints. All experiments would require a complete start-over and the resources thus far utilized for the project would be wasted.</p>
<p>NAMRU-SA has already verified that these 3 cell types from PromoCell differentiate into osteoblasts. Therefore, all 3 cell types being compared in this project must be obtained from PromoCell in order to complete the project with consistency and continuity with the previously collected data.</p>
<p>Market research determined that Promocell has two authorized distributors: VWR International, LLC and Fisher Inc. Based on the information attained during market research, this J&amp;A is being executed to limit offers to those of the manufacturer and authorized distributors that can provide the brand name product that is the sole product that will meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>7. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>NMLC will synopsize this requirement on the FedBizOpps website (FBO.gov) with a combined synopsis / solicitation. In accordance with FAR 13.501(a)(1)(iv) and FAR 5.102(a)(6), because this solicitation will restrict proposals to those of the manufacturer (Promocell) and their authorized distributors (VWR International, LLC and Fisher Inc), NMLC will post a redacted copy of this J&amp;A with the combined synopsis / solicitation.</p>
<p>8. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will perform a price analysis in order to determine that the anticipated cost to the Government of the services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>9. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 6, (NMLC) has no plans at this time to solicit for future contracts for the type of supplies covered by this document using full and open competition. If another potential source emerges, (NMLC) will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. If future requirements exist that do not involve the same research efforts, the government will solicit through full and open competition to remove barriers.</p>
<p>10. Contracting Point of Contact.</p>
<p>The point of contact at Naval Medical Logistics Command is Jennifer M. Reed, Code 05, (301) 619-1200 or by e-mail at Jennifer.m.reed20.civ@mail.mil.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition



Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 08, Bruce W. Carter, Miami VA Medical Center.   

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract for the project titled:  Chapel Hallway Renovation , to MILICON Inc. DBA Zuto, Miramar, FL. Project will be awarded under the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB) Vets First program.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs: Renovate chapel Hallways in accordance with any and all federal, local, state or any other governing body-policy, procedure, legal or otherwise doctrine for the proper intended renovation of the Chapel Hallways to include demo damaged wallpaper, clean, patch and prepare walls to a smooth texture finish. Remove flooring with asbestos mastic and Ductwork with asbestos mastic. Remove ceiling tiles, grid and non-working mixing boxes, all damaged handrails and cove base. Seal, prime and paint walls, paint door/window openings, install new ceiling grid and tiles, install new flooring material and cove base, install new handrails for the chapel hallway.


Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 ( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (X)  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
A contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided:
(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;
(2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5;
(3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance;
(4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price; and
 (b) The contracting officer s determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
(c) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure businesses are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.
The anticipated award price is less than 500K. A separate determination of the contractor s responsibility has been made in accordance with FAR 9. A sole source award is proposed pending negotiation of fair and reasonable price.
MILICON Inc. has successfully completed other services and is familiar with the special requirements.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  This project was originally intended to be issued under the Miami CTOC #3 where MILICON Inc is the contract holder. The proposal came in above the maximum allowable threshold for issuance of a task order. To avoid delaying the project further by re-soliciting, the Government intends to Sole Source this project to MILICON Inc. meeting the customer s needs.  
Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Based on the authorities cited in this justification, a sole source award under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 is dependent on negotiating a fair and reasonable price. 

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

The VIP database was queried in accordance with VAAR 810.001, Market research policy MILICON Inc. is listed in the VIP database.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:   
Multiple SDVOSB firms exist in the VIP database; however, the determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.  

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
  
The VA usually capitalizes on the advantages of the competitive procurements.  Per VA requirement, most construction projects are either competed as competitive SDVOSB set-asides or under pre-existing SDVOSB IDIQ contracts. Due to the solicitation process having already been completed, and not being able to issue a task order off the CTOC (IDIQ contract) due to the amount exceeding the maximum threshold, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, to attempt to enter into a sole source contract with MILICON Inc. Miramar, FL.  The recommended contractor has been verified, both in terms of responsibility, as well as its current status as a certified SDVOSB.

<p>IAW FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), only one vendor is capable of providing the supplies and incidental service because at the present moment only one vendor possesses the certification necessary to perform work on a DoD based network.</p>
<p>The NETCENTS-2 Products contract is a mandatory source for the purchase or lease of Netcentric products for USAF customers. T-Metrics is the company that manufactured Langley's current telephone equipment and software solution for ACC and has the proprietary ownership of the equipment and software required. General Dynamics is the only NETCENTS-2 vendor authorized to obtain and perform the installation of T-Metrics equipment. T-Metrics is not a NETCENTS-2 IDIQ vendor. The required equipment cannot be obtained from another company and similar products cannot be modified to meet the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>Market research determined this requirement should be awarded on a sole-source basis as the equipment and service needed for this effort are only available from one responsible source on the mandatory NETCENTS-2 contracting vehicle. Presently, the T-Metrics solution is the only verified Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) approved system for the EFI&amp;T upgrade. JITC is DoD's Joint Interoperability Certifier and only non-Service Operational Test Agency for Information Technology (IT)/National Security Systems (NSS). This certification allows products and services to operate on DoD based networks. Additional market research identified two other vendors, to include CISCO and Digium, who possessed the capability to EFI&amp;T an upgrade of Air Combat Command's Consolidated Operator Answering System, but these systems were not presently JITC approved. The Air Force will continue to monitor different JITC approved solutions in the commercial market place in order to maximize competition.</p>

<DONBR>GS-03F-0154V
<DESC>This is requirement is for a new time &amp; materials task order to Vastec, Inc. under the GSA Schedule 36 (Office, Imaging, and Document Solutions) Contract GS-03F-0154V. Vastec, Inc. will continue the operation and management of a program to scan and digitize paper documentation applying optical character recognition into a searchable online secured database allowing the Agency to meet a December 31, 2019 deadline. Per the Office of Management and Budgets directive on Managing Government Records Directive (M-12-18), OJP has a requirement to transition its paper records to a searchable, digital format.<br /><br />Previously, OJP procured services from Vastec via an interagency agreement with the Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The intent was for this agreement to provide services until the end of the 2019 calendar year; however, the Agency was notified that the NTIS would no longer be providing these services and OJP would need to find another means to procure the services necessary to meet the OMB directive.
<p>Vastec, Inc. will continue the Agency's effort to digitize its legacy, paper records and documents through implementation of the following tasks: a) Program Management; b) Document Discovery; c) Scanning; d) Document Preparation; e) Onsite and Offsite Digitization; f) Indexing and Image Correction; and g) Conversion to Adobe PDF.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this task order will be a 12-month base period and 2 12-month option periods commencing September 26, 2017 and ending September 25, 2020, if all options are exercised. The task order not-to-exceed amount is $682,653.12.<br /><br />Under FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), a compelling and urgent need exists, and following the FSS ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. An award to Vastec will increase the project's continued success as the Department has made significant progress towards the goal of transitioning to a paperless records storage and retrieval system. A repeatable workflow has been created, and by collaborating with Office of the Chief Information Officer's (OCIO) SharePoint Development Team we have created an efficiency in the creation of the customer records centers in SharePoint which has reduced our reliance on the SME labor categories. This project is at a critical point in its process, and a proper transition would take 180 days to enact, at which time OA-BRD will no longer no longer be able to utilize the current agreement with Department of Commerce to use Vastec, Inc. This downtime will have a significant effect on the current progress, and jeopardize the Department's ability to complete our transition to a paperless document storage and retrieval system by the end of calendar year 2019.</p>
