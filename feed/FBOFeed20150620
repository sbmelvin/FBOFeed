<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with RHK Technology of Troy, MI, for the procurement of a Regenerative Grid Simulator System for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML).
<p>The NIST Semiconductor and Dimensional Metrology Division (SDMD) of the PML provides leadership in conducting research in the areas of dimensional, nanometer-scale, surface, and acoustic pressure metrology; accelerometry; silicon Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology; Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS); power electronics; nano electronics; and flexible/printed electronics.</p>
<p>The technical programs, their goals, technical strategies, activities, and accomplishments described here for each Division project clearly demonstrate the impact of the SDMD's leadership and effective service as it continues to respond to the needs of industry and to contribute to the scientific and engineering communities.<br /><br />SDMD has an existing RHK Pan Scan STM that is used to image Si (100) surfaces with atomic resolution. It is equipped with an RHK SPM 1000 controller. NIST is seeking an upgrade of the controller, for improved imaging resolution, lithography and spectroscopy measurements on silicon surfaces. The resolution of the STM is currently limited by the noise floor of the SPM 1000.<br /><br />The existing RHK Pan Scan STM is the cardinal instrument in the Physical Measurement Laboratory and the success of the projects depend heavily on the performance of the RHK Pan Scan STM.</p>
<p>RHK Technology is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the controller compatible with the existing system. No other vendors' controllers are capable of providing 100 percent compatibility with the existing system.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition 334516, with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by July 6, 2015 will be considered by the Government.</p>
