WNaN networks should adapt to changing conditions by adjusting the topology of the network and the operational mode of the nodes to reduce the demands on the nodes in particular on the physical and link layers.  By working around the limitations of the low-cost nodes that form the network, and by utilizing the rich interconnection fabric created by dense deployment, the WNaN network should provide reliable and highly available battlefield communications at a low system cost.

Previous practice has been to build high cost and hence sparsely deployed nodes, and to organize the network around these nodes.  This program aims to shift the approach used to design military wireless networks from design for radio range to design for node density. Proposers should assume node densities associated with deployments in which each warfighter and each vehicle has a WNaN radio node.

This BAA is for Phase 1 only. The objective of Phase 1 is the development of a proof-of-concept wireless demonstration platform using readily-available low cost RF hardware components.  Later phases will refine the platform using new components as they become available.

WNaN wireless nodes should be based on an RF processing circuit which can be replicated to support a variety of network radio capabilities, such as MIMO, dynamic spectrum, multiple-channel beam-forming, and nulling.  Although this phase will not require the development of new networking technology, WNaN nodes developed in Phase 1 should be able to form a small ad hoc wireless network and simultaneously participate in a 100BaseT network.  In addition, WNaN wireless nodes should serve as platforms for subsequent development of adaptive network technology in later phases.  Phase 1 proof-of-concept wireless nodes should be traceable to a production unit with an expected large quantity procurement cost to the Government of no more than $500 per unit.

Proposals should cite the quantitative and qualitative success criteria that the proposed effort will achieve at the end of Phase 1. 

•	Build and demonstrate 4 RF channel wireless nodes, based on available inexpensive RF circuits, in which the shortcomings of the physical layer can be mitigated at the network layer.
•	$500 unit cost (excluding NRE) in quantities of 100,000.

Determination of estimated cost should be based on production node quantities of 1,000 and 100,000, and should include a detailed basis and analysis of the learning curve, a curve plotting performance against practice, to manufacture the nodes.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA05-50) on or before 12 Noon, November 15, 2005, Eastern Standard Time (EST). 

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs) and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small, or small and disadvantaged businesses due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations.

The Proposers’ Day Workshop was held on 15 September 2005.  The information from this workshop is available on the WNaN website: www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/WNaN/index.htm.  Attendance at the Proposer’s Day is not a prerequisite to responding to this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  Therefore, in order of importance, the technical evaluation criteria include: 1) Technical Approach with elements: (a) Program Scope and Robustness, (b) Device Performance, (c) Networked Radio Performance, (d) Flexibility and Risk Avoidance, and (e) Radio Production Cost; 2) Management Approach; 3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission; and 4) Cost Realism.  For the purpose of award under this BAA, the technical evaluation criteria are more important than cost.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA, and to make award without discussions.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA and instructions on how to respond. NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IDENTIFIED BELOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS NOTICE. ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE SENT TO WNAN@darpa.mil.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 7/5/2005.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 8/4/2005. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in descending order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal Agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions. 
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<RESPDATE>102105
<ARCHDATE>11302005
<CONTACT>Bryan C. Rice, Inventory Forester (907) 586-7088
<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is responsible for the management of the resources on restricted Native allotments in the state of Alaska. These allotments total nearly 15,000 parcels comprising approximately 1.2 million acres. To effectively manage these numerous parcels of land that are dispersed over a vast area, divisions were made into twelve land management units for the purposes of planning and monitoring. Management unit boundaries are based upon and consistent with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Regional Corporation boundaries.  The Koniag Management Unit (KMU) encompasses approximately 12,000 acres of Native allotted land comprising approximately 145 Native Allotments delineated on the attached map. The  purpose  of  the  forest  inventory  is  to  determine  current  stand conditions  and  forested  acreage  by ownership and timber type to provide estimates  of  stand  inventory.  Aerial  photography  digitization will be required  to  identify  stand  types  and stand examinations shall include: cruise  design, stratification, target sampling errors, field measurements, data  processing,  and statistical analysis, in order to â€œground truthâ€ the digitized  stand  type  data.  The  Contractor  shall provide the necessary personnel, equipment, materials, transportation, and supervision to perform the  inventory  project  in accordance with the provisions of the contract. The  US  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Alaska Region,  â€œField  Manual  for  the Forest Inventory of Alaskan Native Landsâ€ (2005),  shall  be  the  procedural  guide  for  the  collection  of forest inventory  data.   The  contract will be awarded to the individual or party submitting  the  quote,  which  is  most  advantageous  to  the  Government considering all terms, conditions and prices. Location and Description The  restricted  native  allotments  are  located on Kodiak Island, Afognak Island, some of the small surrounding islands and a small section along the mainland across Shelikof Straights on the far western area of KMU. The maritime climate is greatly influenced from the relatively warm Alaskan current  that  circulates  from the northeast past Kodiak and Afognak.  The weather  is  characterized  by  heavy  precipitation,  cool  summers,  warm winters,  and  persistently strong surface winds.  Winter storms are common with  associated  high  seas.   Fog  is  heavy  throughout  the year but is especially common from May to September.  In the town of Kodiak, the length of  the  growing  season  averages  134  days  (i.e. days where the minimum temperature  is  greater  than  32f and the mean is greater than 40f).  the average  number  of  frost-free days is 148.  In general, snow doesnâ€™t fall until  mid-November  and  is  gone by early May.  The cool temperatures and short summer make for slow decomposition of litter and logging slash. The  Kodiak  Mountains that form the Kodiak Island Group are a continuation of  the  Kenai  Mountains.   The  land  is  steep,  rugged  and extensively glaciated  (only  a  few  glaciers  remain  on  Kodiak  Island  and none on Afognak).   The coastline is cut by deep fjords and there are numerous deep bays   and   excellent  harbors.   The  combination  of  steep  slopes  and accommodating bays make boat travel much easier than travel by land. The  land  is  drained  by short, swift and clear streams and there are few lakes  greater  than  one  mile  in length.  Many ponds and chains of lakes scatter  the  glacially sculpted landscape. The coastline is still changing and the land sank in places five to six feet with the 1964 earthquake. BIA Furnished Property The  BIA  shall deliver the following list of materials and property to the Contractor.   The  Contractor will be liable for the loss or damage of such property  until  they  are  returned  to  the  BIA COR (Contracting Officer Representative) upon the successful completion and final acceptance of work required  under  contract.  BIA property will be returned within 30 days of contract completion or the termination of the contract.  Final payment will not  be  processed  until all BIA Furnished Property is returned to the BIA COR 1.    List of Native allotments (parcels) within the Koniag management unit including legal descriptions and acreage 2.    One set of aerial photographs (1:18,000) with stereo coverage of Native allotments and the flight line index 3.    One set of compact disks containing orthophotography of Native allotments within the management unit 4.    One set of USGS Quadrangle maps 5.    Stand Record Tally Sheets and Tree Tally Sheets (data recorder use is acceptable with data printout accompanying electronic information.) 6.    U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Alaska Region â€œField Manual for the Forest Inventory of Alaskan Native Landsâ€ (2005) 7.    Plot & Tree Tally Sheets (data recorders may be used) Damage to BIA property will be charged at the rates listed below:                   Aerial photos                       $10.00/photo                   Compact disks                 $10.00/cd                   Photo series guides                 $40.00/guide Qualifications The  minimum  technical qualifications required for all field personnel are listed as follows: 1.    Each crew must have a crew leader with at least B.S. degree in forestry and a minimum of one year experience conducting stand examinations in Alaska 2.    Crew members must have undergraduate course experience in forest mensuration, tree identification, and photogrammetry 3.    Crew members must be able to interpret aerial photography The   Contractor   shall  use  only  personnel  meeting  minimum  technical qualifications  for  performance of work under this contract.  The BIA will require  the  Contractor  to provide transcripts and or resumes documenting the qualifications of all personnel.  The BIA reserves the right to require the  removal of unqualified personnel from the worksite and resubmission of any data supplied by unqualified personnel. Accuracy Standards The  statistical  accuracy  requirements  for  the  forest inventory are as follows: 1.    For any given strata within the management unit, the statistical accuracy will be within 20% standard error of the mean based on basal area 2.    For all strata within the management unit, the statistical accuracy will be within 10% standard error of the mean based on basal area All  errors  noted  through  BIA  inspection  will be corrected and reports resubmitted  to  the  BIA  within  14 days of receipt by the Contractor.  A revisit  to  the stand will be required to collect any missing or incorrect information. Sample Design The  stand  boundaries  within  each  allotment  will  be delineated on the digital  Orthophotography  and  assigned  a  stratum.  Each stand will be a contiguous  area  and  will  stop  at  the end of the stand or at a logical breakpoint  if the stand overflows outside the allotment.  This is required due  to the fact that many of the allotments have not been surveyed and may shift  in the future after an official survey is complete.  If a shift were to  occur, small pockets of non-typed ground would exist.  Therefore timber typing  will shall continue for a distance of not more than 100feet outside the allotment or to a logical breakpoint if it exists. A  percentage  of  each  stratum  will  be  measured  based on the relative occurrence  of each type within the total forested sample area.  A sampling grid  will  be  designed within each sample stand with enough plots to meet the  statistical  requirements  stated  above.   The  sampling grid will be designed to uniformly sample the stand.  Each plot will be located at least 2  chains  from  the  stand boundary.  A minimum of 3 plots will be located within  a  stand.   Locations of plot center points will be recorded in the field  using a mapping-grade global positioning system (GPS) unit (i.e. the Trimble  Pro XR).  A photo point will be established within every stand and photos  will  be  taken facing north, south, east, and west from that photo point using a digital camera.  Stand pictures will be representative of the stand  conditions  of  which  they  were  taken, sequentially numbered, and documented  in  the  field  notes.   Using the photo series for quantifying natural  fuels manual (green 3 ring binders), a photo series number for the photo  that  best  describes  the  fuel  and  vegetation conditions will be recorded  on  every  plot  (this  information  is  used for fire management purposes).   A  digital  photograph & GPS coordinate will be taken of every structure  located  within  the allotment boundary.  Refer to the BIA field manual for review of additional field procedures. Pre-work Meeting The  BIA  COR  and  the  contractor  will arrange for a pre-work meeting to discuss expectations, work plans and dates and allow each party involved to address  matters requiring specific attention.  At the pre-work meeting the contractor will be required to present and submit: a.    action plan outlining specific calendar dates b.    names and resumes of field personnel to be utilized c.    expected production rates, logistic & technical concerns d.    name, address and phone number for the contractor, subcontractor or any other designated representative.

To reduce the risk  and  chances  of  misplaced  and disorganized data, materials will be submitted  by  parcel, stand, strata or any other unit which is appropriate to  organize the results.  If issues, questions or queries arise before the submission   date,   contact  and  communication  with  the  BIA  Technical Representative is required for mitigating circumstances. Stage 2 works will be inspected when complete and submitted. Stage  3  works will be inspected in conjunction with implementation of the field  work  stage  of  this  contract.  Clear and direct communication and coordination  of  the travel and cruise plan will be required to facilitate the  field  inspection.   The  BIA  Technical  Representative  will inspect approximately  10%  of  the  stands  which  have been selected for sampling through the cruise design process.  The purpose of this inspection or check cruise  will  ensure that standards set in the â€œField Manual for the Forest Inventory  of  Alaskan  Native Landsâ€ are followed to create consistent and valid field data.  The results will be averaged to preclude the random plot with significant discrepancy. Stage 4 works will be inspected after submission. The BIA COR shall inspect all deliverables from the stages within 10 business days of receipt. Acceptance If  the  error of the Office Edit Summary exceeds 10% or Sample Point (dbh, height  &  defect) Check exceeds 8% on any inspected stands within a group, editing  will cease and the entire group will be returned to the Contractor (with  all  the related documents).  The Contractor will be responsible for correcting  the  identified  errors and editing the balance of the group to insure  that  the  submission  is  error free.  After corrections have been made,  all  the related documents will be resubmitted to the BIA COR and he will  re-examine the group of stands.  The rechecked stands and points will not  necessarily be the same ones that were previously examined.  The group of  stands  will  be  accepted or rejected upon the re-inspection using the same basis as the initial inspection.  More than one re-inspection required on  any  group  may  result  in  a  charge to the Contractor for additional inspection time and expense. If  the office edit has less than 10% error and all the stands selected for field  inspection  in a group submission have less than 8% errors the group submission  will  be accepted for final editing.  The BIA COR will identify any errors and return only those stands containing errors to the Contractor for final correction.  Upon submission of the final corrections the BIA COR will edit and authorize payment for work completed. Payment The information for this project will list itemized costs, including totals for each stage as well as the final project bid amount. Stages  1&3 will be paid on a 40% midway and 60% completion schedule.  When the  stages are completed half way (measure by acreage) 40% payment will be released.   After  final  submission, inspection and acceptable results are found the final 60% will be released. Stages  2&4  will  be paid 100% after submission, inspection and acceptable results. Default The BIA may, by written notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate the Contractorâ€™s right to proceed with this contract if the Contractor fails to meet the specifications contained in this contract. Contract Period The contract period will extend until the end of FY06.       Due dates       Stages 1 & 2 (completed before stages 3&4)       Stages 3 & 4 Contact  (Fax  907/586-7120, ATTN: Bryan C.

<CONTACT>Bryan C. Rice, Inventory Forester (907) 586-7088
<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for preparing management plans for the restricted native allotments throughout the state of Alaska. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act provided for 12 management units placed strategically throughout the state, but before any management activities take place on an allotment there is certain information that must be determined.  In allotment resource management, this preliminary data collection is a giant task and one that will be ongoing as more data becomes available.  When a solid resource analysis is completed from the data collected, appropriate documents and a thorough management plan may be written to address the needs, wants, and objectives of the landowners affected.  The first stage of this work includes typing of forest covers on an aerial photograph layer, followed by a ground truth of the information. SCOPE The   Contractor  will  type  forest  cover  on  approximately  225  Native allotments  within  the  Cook  Inlet  Management Unit in the late summer of 2005.   The  purpose  of  the  timber  typing is to determine current stand conditions,  and to determine forested acreage by ownership and timber type to  provide estimates of standing timber volume.  The inventory information is  essential in developing forest management plan goals and objectives for Native  allotments.   The  Bureau  of Indian Affairs (BIA) forest inventory field  manual  shall  be  the procedural guide for the collection of forest inventory  data  including  a  section  describing timber typing procedures which is currently being written. DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION OF UNIT The  Cook  Inlet  Management  Unit  (CIMU) is one of twelve land management units  established  by the BIA for the purposes of land management planning and  monitoring.   Management unit boundaries are based upon and consistent with  the  Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Regional Corporation boundaries.   The  CIMU  encompasses  approximately  18,000 acres of Native allotted  land  of  which 75% is considered forested land.  The majority of the allotments is located on flat ground and is accessible by road. BIA Furnished Property The  BIA  shall deliver the following list of materials and property to the Contractor.   The  Contractor will be liable for the loss or damage of such property  until  they  are  returned  to  the  BIA COR (Contracting Officer Representative) upon the successful completion and final acceptance of work required  under  contract.  BIA property will be returned within 30 days of contract completion or the termination of the contract.  Final payment will not  be  processed  until all BIA Furnished Property is returned to the BIA COR 1.    List of Native allotments (parcels) within the Koniag management unit including legal descriptions and acreage 2.    One set of aerial photographs (1:18,000) with stereo coverage of Native allotments and the flight line index 3.    One set of compact disks containing orthophotography of Native allotments within the management unit 4.    One set of USGS Quadrangle maps 5.    Stand Record Tally Sheets and Tree Tally Sheets (data recorder use is acceptable with data printout accompanying electronic information.) 6.    U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Alaska Region â€œField Manual for the Forest Inventory of Alaskan Native Landsâ€ (2005) 7.    Plot & Tree Tally Sheets (data recorders may be used) Damage to BIA property will be charged at the rates listed below:                   Aerial photos                       $10.00/photo                   Compact disks                 $10.00/cd                   Photo series guides                 $40.00/guide Qualifications The  minimum  technical qualifications required for all field personnel are listed as follows: 1.    Each crew must have a crew leader with at least B.S. degree in forestry and a minimum of one year experience conducting stand examinations in Alaska 2.    Crew members must have undergraduate course experience in forest mensuration, tree identification, and photogrammetry 3.    Crew members must be able to interpret aerial photography The   Contractor   shall  use  only  personnel  meeting  minimum  technical qualifications  for  performance of work under this contract.  The BIA will require  the  Contractor  to provide transcripts and or resumes documenting the qualifications of all personnel.  The BIA reserves the right to require the  removal of unqualified personnel from the worksite and resubmission of any data supplied by unqualified personnel. Accuracy Standards The  statistical  accuracy  requirements  for  the  forest inventory are as follows: 1.    For any given strata within the management unit, the statistical accuracy will be within 20% standard error of the mean based on basal area 2.    For all strata within the management unit, the statistical accuracy will be within 10% standard error of the mean based on basal area All  errors  noted  through  BIA  inspection  will be corrected and reports resubmitted  to  the  BIA  within  14 days of receipt by the Contractor.  A revisit  to  the stand will be required to collect any missing or incorrect information. Sample Design The  stand  boundaries  within  each  allotment  will  be delineated on the digital  Orthophotography  and  assigned  a  stratum.  Each stand will be a contiguous  area  and  will  stop  at  the end of the stand or at a logical breakpoint  if the stand overflows outside the allotment.  This is required due  to the fact that many of the allotments have not been surveyed and may shift  in the future after an official survey is complete.  If a shift were to  occur, small pockets of non-typed ground would exist.  Therefore timber typing  will shall continue for a distance of not more than 100feet outside the allotment or to a logical breakpoint if it exists. A  percentage  of  each  stratum  will  be  measured  based on the relative occurrence  of each type within the total forested sample area.  A sampling grid  will  be  designed within each sample stand with enough plots to meet the  statistical  requirements  stated  above.   The  sampling grid will be designed to uniformly sample the stand.  Each plot will be located at least 2  chains  from  the  stand boundary.  A minimum of 3 plots will be located within  a  stand.   Locations of plot center points will be recorded in the field  using a mapping-grade global positioning system (GPS) unit (i.e. the Trimble  Pro XR).  A photo point will be established within every stand and photos  will  be  taken facing north, south, east, and west from that photo point using a digital camera.  Stand pictures will be representative of the stand  conditions  of  which  they  were  taken, sequentially numbered, and documented  in  the  field  notes.   Using the photo series for quantifying natural  fuels manual (green 3 ring binders), a photo series number for the photo  that  best  describes  the  fuel  and  vegetation conditions will be recorded  on  every  plot  (this  information  is  used for fire management purposes).   A  digital  photograph & GPS coordinate will be taken of every structure  located  within  the allotment boundary.  Refer to the BIA field manual for review of additional field procedures. Pre-work Meeting The  BIA  technical  representative  and  the contractor will arrange for a pre-work  meeting  to  discuss expectations, work plans and dates and allow each  party  involved  to address matters requiring specific attention.  At the pre-work meeting the contractor will be required to present and submit: a.    action plan outlining specific calendar dates b.    names and resumes of field personnel to be utilized c.    expected production rates, logistic & technical concerns d.    name, address and phone number for the contractor, subcontractor or any other designated representative.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates awarding a fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity multiple-year (base year, plus 4 option years) contract for new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations.  A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz.  The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher.  The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel.  It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy.  The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios.  Services will include:  project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training.  In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space.  Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent). In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.

This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets.  This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition.  Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement.  Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:  

1.  Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;
2.  Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;
3.  On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;
4.  Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;
5.  Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;
6.  Telephone technical support; and 
7.  Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.

It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements.  Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment.  One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.

Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged.   Faith-based and Community-based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.  To be considered, firms must have at least five (5) years experience with projects of similar scope.  Failure to identify all site personnel and provide requisite resumes may disqualify an Offeror from further consideration or result in a lower technical score.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are, with the exception of price, listed in descending order of importance:  past performance (descending order of subfactors: Past Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment to Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), technical (descending order of subfactors: Technical Capabilities, Proposed Key Organization and Key Personnel, Quality Control/Quality Assurance, and Corporate Resources and Ability to Effectively Manage the Contract, with the following sub/subfactors:  Corporate or Company Resources dedicated specifically to the management of this contract; Staff Training Program to include technical, health and safety, and supervisory training; Recruiting and Retention Plan; Health and Safety Plan; and Drug Free Workplace Policy), small business subcontracting, and price.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Business Subcontracting.

In accordance with FAR 9.104-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The Government reserves the right to award to one or more vendors who will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each technical proposal will be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation.  A finding of Unacceptable in one technical factor may result in the entire technical proposal being found to be unacceptable.  Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price.  Prospective Offerors are forewarned that an acceptable technical proposal and marginal past performance (if included as a factor) with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced proposal affords the Government the best value.  The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror whose non-cost/price evaluation factors (e.g., technical and past performance, if included) are superior.

This agency will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources.   The solicitation, which includes instructions for submitting a quote, will be available on or about 
August 29, 2005.   This solicitation is unrestricted.  Point of Contact of inquiries and clarifications is Laurie L. Williams, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, 320

<DESC>Request for Information
10 Print Scanner Requirement Workshop
September 29, 2005

1.0 Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of State (DOS), National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Department of Defense Biometric Fusion Center (DOD/BFC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have jointly defined an urgent, near-term demand for faster, smaller, more mobile, 10 fingerprint slap capture devices to meet critical national security needs.  These departments have organized a unified User Group in order to develop standardized requirements and to co-sponsor a “Challenge to Industry” as a first step towards meeting these common needs.  

The purpose of this notice is to invite all fingerprint scanner hardware and software vendors to a 10 Print Scanner Requirements Workshop, to be held at NIST on October 13, 2005 at 1:30PM.

2.0 Background

One of the key drivers behind this initiative is the DHS requirement to biometrically register and screen foreign visitors to the United States based on an Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Standard (EFTS) compliant 10-print slap capture at enrollment and 2-print slap verification thereafter. Meeting this mandate will enhance the ability to match enrollees against latent prints; streamline the criminal background check process by eliminating the need for data extracts; mitigate concerns about false negatives when matching enrollees against poor quality prints; and ensure fast processing time in resolving false positives, especially as the size of the matching pool grows.  

DHS plans to deploy currently available 10-print capture technology to selected locations where the current technology is operationally feasible, but the size, mobility, speed, and power requirements of these existing devices have critical impacts to many of the current facilities. Enhancements are necessary to support viable operations at other locations.

The User Group has determined that the DHS requirements in this area are shared by other Departments, and has expressed their common and critical needs for new scanner technology with operational performance characteristics for use within their existing biometric applications.  The User Group is sponsoring a “Challenge to Industry” to provide 10-print capture devices meeting the processing time and size requirements and meeting FBI and industry format and quality requirements within the next 12 months to support the critical mission needs of the user community, and, specifically, to meet the aggressive mission requirements of DHS.  

To achieve these joint objectives, improved 10-print capture devices and capture software are needed to support the fast capture of 10 print slaps.
  
The User Group is very interested in challenging industry to expedite technology improvements to ensure needed capability can be deployed as quickly as possible.  For planning purposes the anticipated scale of enhanced device deployment, within the next 12-18 months, may range from 3,000 – 10,000 units across government agencies.

The User Group invites fingerprint capture hardware and software vendors to an 10 Print Scanner Requirements Workshop, to be hosted by NIST on Thursday, October 13th, 2005, at 1:30 pm at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD facility.  

This workshop will provide more detailed information about the requirements, clarify business and technical questions that may be raised, and begin the process of determining the potential for industry to meet the requirements in the needed timeframe.

3.0 Requirements of Ten Slap Print Capture Device 

The current version of the requirements generated by the User Group is attached to this notice, but may be refined as a result of our engagement with industry. 

4.0 Market Research

This workshop is intended as  “market research” by the Government, to determine whether industry can develop innovative technology to meet the requirements of all the agencies participating in the workshop within an abbreviated timeframe.  

The Government intends to continue working with industry over the near term on this ten print effort, however, interested parties are advised that none of the participating Departments are under any obligation to take any further action with any party as a result of this market research effort.  

Following this workshop, the User Group may conduct a series of one on one meetings with selected members of industry to gain additional insight into the state of the market and how industry proposes to meet these new requirements.  The Government will schedule these meetings based on its review of the five-page overview of the vendors approach to meeting these new requirements within the necessary time frame.  

All information supplied in response to this request will be shared within the User Group. The working group consists of both Government and non-Government participants.  All proprietary information shall be appropriately labeled to ensure proper handling of sensitive corporate information. 

5.0 Desired Response

The Government requests that firms interested in this requirement provide the following information:

a.	A summary paper must be submitted with each response to the RFI. The purpose of the summary paper is to help the government understand how you intend to meet the attached requirements within 12- months or forecasting what capabilities can be delivered within this timeframe. 

The summary paper requested should not be a marketing tool. It is an information tool that will be used by the US-VISIT program and other government agencies in their search for new technologies, and to familiarize all stakeholders with the technologies you describe.  The information on the summary paper should be accurate, succinct, complete and descriptive of the technology.  The summary paper should not exceed 5 pages using 12-point Times New Roman type. 


b.	Any descriptive literature for existing product that can be enhanced or modified to meet these new requirements. 

Please submit the information requested by noon, October 27, 2005 in three hardcopies and one electronic copy to Shelby Buford, Jr. at Suite 1800, 1616 N. Ft. Myer Drive, Arlington, VA 22209.  No email submissions will be accepted.

6.0 Comments

Please submit questions and comments on the attached Requirements by noon, October 10, 2005 to Ms. Myrtle Miller, US-VISIT by email at myrtle.v.miller@DHS.gov.

7.0 Workshop Registration

10-Print Capture
Scanner & Software Requirements

Version 0.9 – September 29, 2005


Prepared by
Homeland Security 10-Print Capture User Group

Consisting of representatives from the
Department of Homeland Security
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Department of State
National Institute of Justice
Department of Defense Biometrics Fusion Center
National Institute of Standards & Technology

 
1.0 Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of State (DOS), National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Department of Defense Biometric Fusion Center (DOD/BFC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have jointly defined an urgent, near-term demand for faster, smaller, more mobile, 10 fingerprint slap capture devices to meet critical national security needs.  These departments have organized a unified User Group in order to develop standardized requirements and to co-sponsor a “Challenge to Industry” as a first step towards meeting these common needs.  These requirements represent the consensus position of the participants of the User Group.  

The User Group identified the need for a 10 print capture scanner device (the “Scanner”), along with client- and server-based utility software (the “Software”), including slap quality, segmentation, sequence verification, fingerprint image quality, compression, and other utilities. The Scanner and Software shall be interoperable, that is, any approved Scanner shall work with any approved Software and vice versa. 

The essential operational requirements of the Scanner and Software, some of which are not met currently by the Industry, include the following general objectives: 
 
1.	Meet the current space requirements (6”x6”x6”) constraints of the deployment facilities.
2.	Be mobile so as to support multiple operational scenarios.
3.	Perform all the ten print capture processing steps including individual finger segmentation and image quality checks within 5 seconds per slap, from the time the subject places his/her fingers on the Scanner, to the moment the capture Software has segmented, analyzed image quality, and delivered status to the operator. 
4.	Be powered without an additional 120v power plug in order to meet power capacity and power cabling constraints of the current facilities. 
5.	Comply with the current biometric industry standards
6.	Meet or exceed fingerprint quality requirements contained in the latest version (7.1) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification, Appendix F.  

The size of the Scanner, power requirements, and speed of both the Software and Scanner will have critical impacts on current facilities and operations. Although we are not aware of any technology existing today that is able to meet these parameters, we intend to minimize the negative impacts of 10-print capture deployment to environments and populations where delays in processing are intolerable.  
 
2.0 Requirements

Below are the Scanner and Software Requirements.   The term “shall” indicates a mandatory requirement.  The term “should” indicates a strongly desired requirement, but not mandatory.

2.1 General Scanner and Software Requirements: 

1.	The Scanner and Software shall capture the ten fingers using 2 four finger slaps and one 2 thumbs slap.   
2.	The Scanner and Software shall support slap capture of both identification slaps and individual finger flats.
3.	The Scanner and Software shall output fingerprint images in accordance with format standards identified in section 2.6, below.
4.	The Scanner and Software should support rolled fingerprint capture. 
5.	The Scanner and Software shall be able to auto sense or auto capture finger when a finger is placed on it. 
6.	The Scanner and Software should have an anti-spoofing capability (e.g. live finger detection).
7.	The Scanner shall be factory calibrated and shall provide automatic recalibration.
8.	The Scanner should be mobile enough to be used by subjects who cannot reach the countertop. 
9.	The Scanner shall have the capability to be firmly mounted on the counter-top.
10.	The Scanner shall operate in the following environment
        .  Temperature Range 35°F to 120°F (2°C to 49°C) 
        ·  Humidity Range 10-90% non-condensing; splash resistant 
        ·  Direct sunlight and/or in variable outdoor conditions. 

2.2 Scanner Form Factors

1.	The Scanner shall be no larger than the following dimensions: Length 6", Width 6", and Height 6". 
2.	The Scanner shall capture a slap size image of no less than 3.2 inches wide by 3 inches tall.
3.	The weight of the Scanner shall not exceed 5 pounds.
4.	The Scanner shall have a mean time between failure of at least 5 years of 7x24 operational use. 
5.	The Scanner shall have sealed, rugged container with high tolerance for shock and vibration
6.	Other proper human factor design should be considered, for example, but not limited to 
        ·  tilting capture area angle to increase pressure on the platen to achieve better print quality,
        ·  be designed to support both handheld and counter mounted use.
7.	The Scanner should provide visible indication of power and status (e.g. off-line; ready, processing). 

2.3 Scanner Interface and Drivers

1.	The Scanner shall interface with Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP environments.
2.	The power for the Scanner shall be drawn from the desktop computer to which it is connected and not require an additional 120v plug. 
3.	The Scanner interface to desktop computers shall be supported through a single, 6’ cable to provide both data transmission and power supply.
4.	The Scanner shall be provided with device drivers.
5.	The Scanner drivers shall run in Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP environments, in both 32 and 64 bit operating modes.
6.	The Scanner shall support upgrading and managing of the software/firmware in the unit from the connected PC.
7.	The Scanner shall be UL certified.

2.4 Scanner Fingerprint Image Quality

1.	The Scanner image quality shall be certified to be in compliance with or exceed the FBI's EFTS Appendix F Image Quality Specifications (IQS) for Identification Flats.
2.	A means should be provided to verify that the Scanner continues to meet EFTS Appendix F image quality requirements at operator selected intervals throughout the useful life of the Scanner.
3.	The Scanner shall eliminate the Halo Effect: the effect of condensation from placing warm, moist fingers on the platen.
4.	The Scanner should have the ability to capture print images when the fingers are dry or wet.
5.	The Scanner shall be able to captures high quality fingerprint images regardless of skin color or age of the subject.
6.	The Scanner and Software shall provide means to distinguish and eliminate ghost (residual latent fingerprint) images.

2.5  Scanner Support Utility Software (“Software”)

1.	The Software shall be in the form of a Software Development Kit (SDK) for easy integration with both client (PC with Scanner attached) and server (an application server without the Scanner attached) applications. 
2.	The Software, operating with the Scanner, shall deliver segmented, quality assessed and sequenced images to the client component in no greater than 5 seconds per step, from the moment the subject first touches the scanner platen, through capture of one of the three slap images.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Mark VII is a Laser Target Locator which integrates an eyesafe laser range finder, a digital mangetic compass and inclinometer, and an image intensifier tube (for use at nig ht).  The MARK VII by itself is capable of determining the distance, direction and elevation angle of a far target relative to the operator's position.  When connected to a global positioning system (GPS) device, either a precision location GPS receiver (P LKGR) or a defense advance GPS receiver (DAGR), the MARK VII exports its data to the GPS device.  The GPS device uses its self location and combines that with data from the MARK VII to calculate a ten digit grid coordinate of the target.  Northrop Grumman Laser Systems (Litton Systems) is the sole manufacturer of the MARK VII and retains all proprietary technical data.  They alone have the technical expertise and trained personnel to support the repair of the MARK VII.  Offerors who can demonstrate they can  meet the Government's reqpuriements will be considered for award. No hard copy of the solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 039 (29 SEP 05) – Response to Industry Question Concerning Program Protection Plan The CSAR-X Program Protection Plan (PPP), as identified with the PRV Security  Classification Guide, is a Government document providing information to CSAR-X  test and operational users on the requirements to protect the CSAR-X aircraft  within the test or operational environments.  The draft RFP includes the  requirement for the offerors to propose the efforts necessary to support the  CSAR-X program office in developing the CSAR-X Program Protection Plan.  The  PPP should not drive any design requirements.  All design efforts for the CSAR- X program should focus on the technical requirements as set forth in the CSAR-X  SRD and RFP. Technology that needs to be protected in the test and operational environment  includes, but is not limited to, the following; 1.  Technology used to defeat a threat 2.  Information used to accomplish a threat defeat. 3.  Examples: sensor performance, countermeasures performance, intelligence  receiver performance, CNI performance, encryption/decryption methods/equipment. 4.  Any deficiencies related to the above. The CSAR-X Extended Reference Library document has also been updated to include  a link to TO 00-35D-54 in the unrestricted documents section. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 038 (22 SEP 05) – Draft RFP Sections L+M The CSAR-X Flight has issued an updated draft RFP Sections L+M for SDD and  initial Production efforts for industry review and comment.

The CSAR-X Extended Reference  Library document has also been updated and moved into the regular document  library. COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE-X AMENDMENT 037 (17 AUG 05) – Response to Industry  Request for Cargo Air Load Model The Air Force no longer supports the Cargo Air Load Model (CALM).  The current  program is the Automated Air Load Planning System (AALPS), and is available at  https://www.tis.army.mil/aalps/default.htm.  AALPS helpdesk requests must be  directed to 1 (866) 822-4672. The AALPS program is available on 3 disks and is  free of charge.

Please contact the individuals listed below to establish date for  discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release (i.e. data  items). PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 031 (12 MAY 05) - Draft RFP The PRV Flight has issued a draft RFP for SDD and initial Production efforts  for industry review and comment.  Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.

The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email  request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson,  by COB 18 March 2005.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document).

<CONTACT>William Thoreen, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-692-4359, Fax 202-205-9028, Email William.Thoreen@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), is pleased to present this solicitation for the EAGLE (Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions) program. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. 


The objective of the EAGLE procurement is to establish contracts to provide IT support services in five functional service categories (FC), stated below in their entirety. These contract-level service descriptions are intended to provide sufficient scope and flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements. Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the task order level. 


(FC1) Infrastructure Engineering Design, Development, Implementation, and Integration. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of system design and development through deployment to ensure DHS IT solutions will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives. These efforts include the full range of infrastructure engineering design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, integration, implementation, and deployment. 


(FC2) Operations and Maintenance. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all operations and maintenance (O&M) solutions, processes, and procedures necessary to sustain systems within the DHS Enterprise at the highest levels of service and availability consistent with cost, schedule, and performance objectives. These solutions may be required across the DHS Infrastructure, to include, but not limited to, the following operational areas: Data Center, Help Desk and Field Support Services (e.g., Desk-side support and LAN Administration), Network and Security Operations, and Collaboration Services (e.g, E-mail, Voice, and Video Services). This functional category includes the full range of O&M solutions, from maintaining and upgrading individual pieces of hardware and software to full managed service solutions. 


(FC3) Independent Test, Validation, Verification, and Evaluation. As ordered, the contractor shall provide the full range of independent test, validation, verification, and evaluation solutions to ensure that all IT products and services meet DHS standards, and are performing to defined design, cost, schedule and performance specifications/capabilities. The contractor shall provide best practices, technologies, tools, and support to quality and operational assessments, integration testing and system test and evaluation, including security certification and accreditation, for IT systems. The contractor shall also provide independent verification and validation through the monitoring and evaluation of projects through activities such as, but not limited to, assessments, process and procedure audits, project and performance management, and systems analysis and design. 


(FC4) Software Development. As ordered, the contractor shall provide any and all phases of software design and development including deployment to ensure DHS applications and databases will enable their users to meet their mission goals and objectives. These efforts include the full range of software design, development, implementation and integration, including, but not limited to, concept development, planning, requirements definition and analysis, systems design and development, coding and testing, production, deployment, implementation, integration, and software application maintenance.  


(FC5) Management Support Services. The contractor shall provide, as ordered, the full range of business and technical management services that assist in the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of policies, procedures, guidelines, and directives. These documents and guidance will allow DHS to comply with the requirements of law and legislation, and operate the enterprise in an efficient and effective manner. These services encompasses all areas of IT policy and planning including, but not limited to, enterprise architecture, security, training, enterprise resource management, business process reengineering, IT transformation and strategy, organizational change leadership, and enterprise and program management office support (e.g. business case development and performance management).  


The single EAGLE solicitation will include two separate and distinct source selections, one unrestricted and one set-aside for small business. Source Selections for both of these evaluation tracks will be conducted at the functional service category level. Vendors will be allowed to propose on one, any or all of the functional service categories. EAGLE contracts will be awarded to vendors in the functional service categories for which they are determined to provide the best value to the government. Proposal requirements will emphasize qualifications rather than technical solutions. The following factors comprise the basis for award: past performance; quality awards and certifications; program management and quality control program; ability to recruit, train and retain high quality personnel; ability to achieve results through teaming; knowledge and understanding of DHS; small business participation (unrestricted track only); and pricing. 


Multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded to highly qualified contractors that possess the capabilities and demonstrated experience to serve as EAGLE prime contractors in one or more of the five functional service categories. The Government carefully developed evaluation criteria to identify the most highly qualified offerors which demonstrate the capability to provide, as a prime contractor, the full range of services envisioned in the respective functional category being proposed. Although the contract-level source selection will focus only on prime contractors and their experience as prime contractors, offerors are free to form teams as they see fit, particularly in the interest of providing a more definitive small business subcontracting plan. The number of contract awards resulting from the unrestricted and small business set-aside tracks will be limited to a number sufficient to maintain competition for task orders. Prospective offerors are encouraged to conduct a self assessment against the evaluation criteria to determine if they will be competitive in a functional category for either the small business set-aside or the unrestricted evaluation tracks. Prospective offerors that do not believe they will be among the most highly rated competitors should instead pursue subcontractor/teaming opportunities with the EAGLE contract awardees. Task orders will be competitively awarded for the specific work to be conducted under these functional service category contracts. In the course of task order competitions, EAGLE prime contractors will be expected to establish the best solution (and team) for the specific task order requirements. The EAGLE program will strongly encourage teaming throughout the life of the contracts.


For the set-aside portion, only small businesses will be considered for prime contract award. NAICS codes will be used at the Functional Category (FC) level. The NAICS codes and size standards are as follows: (FC1) NAICS 541512 - $21M size standard; (FC2) NAICS 517110, 541513, 811212, 518210 with an overall the size standard of 1500 employees; (FC3) 541512 - $21M size standard; (FC4) 541511- $21M size standard; (FC5) 541611 - $6M size standard.  The NAICS 541519 listed in the general information section of this synopsis was selected for announcement purposes only because of its breadth of coverage.  


The unrestricted portion will require offerors to include goals for subcontracting with small business concerns. As applicable, offerors will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR Part 19. Proposed subcontracting goals will be addressed as an evaluation factor in the selection of the unrestricted awardees. Additionally, evaluation sub-factors will be included for prime contractor participation in the DHS Mentor-Protege program and small disadvantaged business participation. Further information regarding subcontracting and mentor-protege opportunities can be found by www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. The website provides a detailed description of the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program and provides an application to apply for it. Processing time is ten (10) calendar days.  



EAGLE contracts will promote the use of performance based contracting, accommodate the issuance of task orders for all types of pricing arrangements (Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, T&M, etc.) and will allow for various incentive contracting features. Specific program or project requirements will be defined in task orders that will be competed at the functional service category level. Task orders will be competed using the Fair Opportunity provisions of the FAR. EAGLE contracts will have a five year base and two one-year option periods. Individual tasks will specify delivery or performance period requirements that may run up to 24 months beyond the term of the contract. EAGLE will allow for task order performance at any location in the United States (CONUS) or outside the US (OCONUS). IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. This amount is intended to provide consideration for the IDIQ award. The scope of the contracts and the limited number of IDIQ contract awards will provide each vendor with adequate opportunities to receive task orders. 


A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on October 13, 2005 in the U.S. Department of Commerce Auditorium at 14th and Constitution Ave, Washington, DC. The conference is expected to last approximately one hour and will be limited to a review of the RFP proposal requirements. No technical or strategic topics will be discussed. Attendance is not mandatory. Multiple sessions may be held, depending upon the volume of interest. Registration is required. Registration details will be provided on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) and www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness on October 3, 2005. Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and a maximum of only two representatives from each company will be allowed. Please do not send registration requests to the DHS EAGLE email address. 


Due to the anticipated level of interest, the ITAC will not entertain requests for contractor visitations or marketing calls. All RFP questions shall be submitted in writing via email to dhseagle@dhs.gov and must include a reference to the RFP section, paragraph, and page number.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to:  (1) clarify the technical objectives; (2) change the recommended date for FY 06 submissions to 28 Oct 2005; (3) change the individual award time periods and dollar ranges under Award Information; and (4) change the technical point of contact.  No other changes have been made.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 06 by 5pm Eastern time on 28 Oct 05; FY 07 by 01 Nov 06; and FY 08 by 01 Nov 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    


FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development and operation of information management technology in accordance with AFRL Information Management technology goals.

This solicitation is divided into two technical areas :

Area (1):  COI Creation and Deployment Frameworks and Tools.  This area seeks to provide formalisms, capabilities, and tools that will enable the creation and management of COI infospaces.  These formalisms, capabilities, and tools will be both interactive and automated depending on their use context, and will provide a meaningful and substantive foundation from which to evolve practical, operations-ready COI infospaces.  The users of these formalisms, capabilities, and tools will be primarily non-programmer Information Management Staff (IMS) personnel.  

The goal of this research area is to provide the IMS with the ability to scope, define, specify, and characterize the COI information producers and consumers as well as the processes and information flow requirements, and to capture this information within a formal framework. The intent is that the formalization and capture of this information will provide the mechanisms by which functionally operational COIs are dynamically instantiated and maintained.  Further, the semantics and structure of the information produced and consumed must be captured to facilitate the mediation and/or transformation of disparate but semantically similar information.  In addition, the semantics of the COI infospace must also be captured to facilitate interoperability at the COI level.  

Successful proposals in this research area will contribute innovative approaches to the mitigation of the slow and arduous COI information engineering process by providing formal approaches, capabilities, and tools that enable the rapid creation and deployment of COI infospaces.

Area (2):  Agile, Survivable, Reconfigurable, and Self-healing Information Management Infrastructures  .  Current research in the area of net-centric technologies is focused primarily on static ground-based infrastructures.  Very little consideration has been given to the architectural, design, deployment, and operational requirements for establishing similar information management and dissemination capabilities in environments that are highly mobile and operate under extremely uncertain conditions.  In order to enable and exploit the promise of net-centricity across the spectrum of military operations, it is essential that we begin to understand the technical challenges these environments present and begin to architect practical solutions that address these challenges. 

In future military operations, dynamic mobile networking will provide the information sharing "plumbing" over which net-centric operations will enable the promise of significant improvements in situational awareness and control.  The true promise of these improvements will only be realized when the middleware that exploits these networking capabilities can provide a sophisticated infrastructure that facilitates value-added information sharing. This information infrastructure must be agile and adapt to the continuously changing networking and information environment.  

Ground-based information management infrastructures assume that the producers and consumers of information are known a priori and change very infrequently. Further, these infrastructures assume that the network is always operational and the connections are fast and clean.  By contrast, in highly mobile environments (Airlift, CSAR, TST, etc.), assets that produce and consume information enter and leave the information domain (or COI) constantly, and with little or no advanced warning.  Indeed, the sum total of information available and/or required within a given information domain is constantly in flux.  The network environment is continually subject to interference, instability, intermittent connectivity, and wide variations in quality and availability.  Regardless of these circumstances it is critical that information management infrastructure continue to work effectively and efficiently in order deliver the right information to the right person at the right time.

We are seeking research proposals that are considerate of the entire scope of this problem domain but are themselves focused on addressing the specific issues of agile, survivable, reconfigurable, and self-healing information management infrastructures that continue to function effectively and efficiently in highly uncertain mobile environments. Successful proposals will suggest innovative approaches that will enable these capabilities in limited network and computing environments where bandwidth, latency, compute, and storage are premium.  Further, proposed demonstration of research results within the context of a reasonable Air Force scenario will inform the selection process.


II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $15M.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY 05.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $0.7M; FY 06 - $4M; FY 07 - $4.3M; FY 08 - $3.6M; and FY09 - $2.4M.  For Area 1, individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 to $200,000.  For Area 2, individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months with dollar amounts ranging between $300,000 and $400,000.   Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.


SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 5pm Eastern time on 28 Oct 05; FY 07 by 01 Nov 06; and FY 08 by 01 Nov 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 September 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  Submission of white papers will be regulated in accordance with FAR 15.208.

<DESC>BOAT DAVIT/MARINE CRANE REPLACEMENT
MARKET RESEARCH 


PURPOSE OF CONTACT: 
The Coast Guard is conducting market research in order to identify vendors who can provide commercially available boat davit/marine crane units for a unique application with specific constraints.  

SYNOPSIS:
1.	General   
1.1.	The government is considering replacement of outdated articulated crane boat davit units on the existing Coast Guard 270 WMEC Class cutters.  The equipment will include the port side boat davit/crane unit and cradle located on the port side of the fantail.  The boat and cradle will be GFE.
1.2	This will be a unique davit/crane installation due to physical constraints imposed by the requirements for landing helicopters.  
1.3	The government is seeking information and interest from potential vendors who could provide equipment delivery.

2.	Equipment: 
2.1 	The boat davit/marine crane will be used to lift, move to boarding position, launch, and recover a fully loaded nominal 24’-0” x 9’-0” RHIB with two people onboard in advanced sea states.  Total lifting/launching weight will be 6555 pounds including allowances for weight growth and boat replacement.  
2.2 	U.S. Coast Guard standard operating procedure is to lift the RHIB from the storage cradle and boom or slew it to deck edge where it is held while the coxswain and engineer board the RHIB.  The RHIB is then lowered to the water with the crew of two on board.  Once the RHIB is in the water the remaining boat crew members climb down and board the boat.  With everyone on board, the RHIB is then powered away.  Recovery will be the same operation in reverse.
2.3	The davit/crane may be powered by either electro-hydraulic or electric power.
2.4	The distance from the deck to the waterline at the stern of the 270 is approximately 9’-4” (see Figure 3).
2.5	The operating environmental conditions are: 
a.  The U.S. Coast Guard normally performs small boat operations in sea states up to sea state 4.  The Equipment Interface Accelerations (EIA) on the aft deck, at the boat location, in Sea State 4 are; Ax = 8.9 ft/sec2, Ay = 6.2 ft/sec2, and Az = 39.2 ft/sec2, where Ax is the longitudinal acceleration, Ay is the transverse acceleration, and Az is the vertical acceleration.
b.  Normal operations of the ship are carried out in sea states up to 8 (storm conditions) without damage to installed equipment.  The Equipment Interface Accelerations (EIA) on the aft deck, at the boat location, in Sea State 8 are; Ax = 68.6 ft/sec2, Ay = 49.9 ft/sec2, and Az = 96.9 ft/sec2.

3.	Equipment Layout:
3.1	The RHIB may be installed in either the bow forward or aft configuration, as determined by the crane or davit supplier.  However, when the boat is launched the bow shall be facing the bow of the ship.  Figure 1 shows the RHIB installed in the bow forward condition.  The orientation of the RHIB can be changed to suit the operation of the davit or crane.  The position of the RHIB on the port may be changed to suit the vendors proposed equipment arrangement.
3.2	The davit/crane may be located forward, aft or alongside the stowed RHIB.
3.3	No part of the davit/crane, when in the stowed position, shall extend above the obstruction free zone line for the HH-60J helicopter.  Only during boat launch and recovery operations is it permissible for the davit/crane to extend above the obstruction free zone line.  The obstruction free line is shown on Figure 1, i.e., if the davit/crane were installed at frame 222.17 the maximum permissible height of the davit/crane, when stowed, would be 8’-9¼” (2673mm).
3.4	Areas on the aft deck must remain clear.  These include boarding access located between frames 242 and 245, line handling access between the port side chocks and the capstan.  See Figure 2.
3.5	Davit/crane placement in the stowed position shall not interfere with the flight deck net deployment.  See figures 1 and 2.
3.6	The launch area is directly outboard of the ships propellers.  The davit/crane should have positive control of the boat to the maximum extent practical.   Davit/crane systems with either single or multi-point attachment and lift systems will be considered.
3.7	Launch control of the davit/crane and RHIB on U.S. Coast Guard cutters is normally carried out by a launch operator stationed at a control stand located at the deck at the edge where the operator has view of the RHIB at all times.  Launch controls from a location inside the RHIB are not necessary for the anticipated installation.

To obtain Figures 1 through 3 and drawing, please send request to Sharon.J.Jackson@uscg.mil  or call Sharon Jackson at (410) 762-6463. Please include your e-mail address or mailing address, which shall include company name, complete address (no P.O. Box), phone number and point of contact.

The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561720 and the small business size standard is $14.0.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NAAJ6400600001MAS.  It is the Government’s intent to award this contract for the base year with two option years to follow.  Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, supplies, cleaning materials, equipment and supervision to perform the work specified in the Statement of Work, except for the Government Furnished Equipment.  The janitorial services shall be completed between 6:30 P.M. and 6:30 A.M., Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays.  The Commerce Children’s Center, a.k.a. CCC, Building 26, is 685 square meters (7,369 square feet) with approximately 40 percent carpet, 11 rest rooms, 1 laundry room and 1 kitchen (floor plan of the building will be included in the statement of work).  The Contractor shall clean the Commerce Children’s Center on a daily basis to the HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS set forth in the Statement of Work; to the standards set forth by the State of Colorado Health Department; and to the standards set forth by the State of Colorado Department of Human Services, who licenses the Commerce Children’s Center.

Periodic inspections will be done at the discretion of the COTR to assure compliance with cleaning, health, and safety standards.  It is vital in the performance of this contract that cleaning be of a high quality for the health and safety of the children and adults housed in the Commerce Children’s Center.  The acceptable level of cleaning is almost that of a hospital environment.  This is not an office building, thus, the cleaning is specialized and exacting. The children are aged from infant to preschool and may be crawling on the floor, putting hands and found items in their mouths, etc.  We cannot emphasize enough the criticality of thorough, daily cleaning of the CCC.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that their employees comply with current and normal security measures at the facility and the site.  Upon award of contract - the Contractor shall inventory all Government furnished equipment to verify that all equipment as specified does exist at the facility.

Upon “Notice of Contract Award”, all contractors, sub-contractors, their supervisors in charge and all working personnel requiring access to the site shall be required to submit to a background security investigation in accordance with the Department of Commerce Security Regulations. All personnel requiring access to the site must pass the background security investigation, before they will be allowed access to the site or be issued a Photo ID.  The charge for the Security Background Check is $88.00 per each background security investigation performed. The Government will pay for all Security Background Checks performed by DOC Security on the Contractor employees, however, the above statement is limited to only those employees that pass the security background checks.  All background check fees associated with employees that fail the background check will be at the Contractor’s expense and will be back-charged/deducted from the Contractor’s Contract Award Amount. Please contact the Contracting Officer for a site inspection and visit, which will be coordinated with the COTR.  Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Provide Trunked Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Systems and Radio Communication Repair and Maintenance Services
<SOLNBR>RFPX000535
<RESPDATE>072505
<CONTACT>Laurie Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-0954, Fax 202-616-6055, Email llwilliams@bop.gov - Richard Formella, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-0954, Fax 202-616-6055, Email rformella@bop.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  This is not a request for proposals.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) requires new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations.  A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz.  The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher.  The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel.  It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy.  The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios.  Services will include:  project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training.   In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space.  Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent).  In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.

This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets.  This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition.  Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement.  Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:  
 
1.Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;
2. Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;
3. On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;
4. Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;
5. Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;
6. Telephone technical support; and 
7. Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.

It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements.  Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment.  One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.

Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE SMART OIL-WELL BOREHOLE CASINGS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE SMART OIL-WELL BOREHOLE CASINGS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to assist in advancing the technology and commercialize LLNL's Smart Borehole Casings for application in the oil recovery industry.

This invention is a technology capable of using a densely spaced network of sensors, emplaced along and outside oil well casings to monitor critical parameters in a subsurface oil reservoir.  Data from multiple sensor types will be combined with modern data fusion technology to yield unprecedented, real-time knowledge of the reservoir and processes such as primary and secondary oil recovery.  Sensors located deep within the reservoir are much more sensitive than sensors located on the surface.

There are three new aspects of this invention:
1.	Installing sensors on the outside of borehole casings before they are grouted in place.
2.	Installing multiple types of sensors that will produce complementary data.
3.	Processing these data sets using the "stochastic engine' [Ramirez et al., (2004).]

Examples of sensors that can be installed include seismic sensors, electrical resistance tomography (ERT) electrodes, tiltmeters, electromagnetic (EM) induction tomography coils and thermocouples.

Features of the Technology: 
o	Real-time, continuous data acquisition
o	Does not interfere with normal well operations
o	Low capital cost of instruments
o	Low operating costs for data acquisition
o	Data acquisition can be remote

Benefits of the Technology: 
o	The proposed technology enables continuous, real-time mapping and monitoring of subsurface fluid composition and distribution in deep oil reservoirs.  This provides several benefits for hydrocarbon recovery optimization:
o	Identifying bypassed oil and fluid-flow barriers
o	Mapping fluid-saturation changes
o	Optimizing well locations
o	Avoiding early water or gas breakthrough.



Applications Envisioned: 
Real-time reservoir mapping and monitoring to maximize oil recovery

LLNL is seeking R&D partners to further develop and license the technology for commercialization. The partner should have a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at 
http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Smart Oil-Well Borehole Casings should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise, capabilities and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

 
Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 109-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Smart Oil-Well Borehole Casings.

The Offeror shall submit a proposal/quote that completely addresses all evaluation areas.
