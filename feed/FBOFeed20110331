<DESC><p>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)&nbsp;intends to award a sole source contract modification to American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is estimated that ATRI's&nbsp;sole source&nbsp;contract will have modified period of performance from four years to eight years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the proposed contract modification, ATRI will continue to maintain a freight performance measurement (FPM) research program focused on measuring speed and travel time reliability on freight significant corridors and measuring crossing and delay time at major US international land border crossings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The data resulting from the FPM program will be used to identify areas of significant freight congestion and bottlenecks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another primary use of the data will be to monitor progress in the U. S. Department of Transportation's (DOT's) and FHWA's strategic objective of system peformance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key objectives of this work are to:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) develop and / or refine methods of collecting data on freight travel (congestion); (b) develop tools for analyzing and processing data; (c) derive measures for congestion and reliability; (d) develop data products and tools that will assist DOT, FHWA, and state and local transportation agencies in addressing surface transportation congestion; and (e) develop a rich freight data source that can be used to inform the development of strategies and tactics for managing and relieving freight congestion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key facets of the FPM program shall include:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) routine reporting of results to support FHWA's performance measurement and reporting; (2) development of tools and data products that will assist DOT, FHWA, State Departments of Transportation, and other public transportation agencies in managing congestion and bottlenecks in the freight transportation system; (3) development of data products and tools that add value to the freight planning process and freight modeling; (4) analysis of freight travel time data as it relates to delay caused by nonrecurring congestion, with an emphasis on construction / work zones, crashes, breakdowns, extreme weather conditions, and special events; (5) targeted outreach to enhance the public transportation agencies' and private sector organizations' knowledge and understanding of the importance of FPM data (freight-specific, intercity data on travel time); (6) development of a freight travel time database that can be used to guide investment decision at the state and local level and be used by FHWA and DOT to guide national policy and legislation related to freight management; and (7) engagement with state, regional and local transportation agencies and universities conducting transportation research on behalf of transportation agencies in specific projects and case studies that use FPM data.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span><br />ATRI alone is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform this&nbsp;sole source&nbsp;contract modification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through past / related research, ATRI has demonstrated a unique and innovative concept to provide the required services related to collecting proprietary truck travel time data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ATRI through its unique relationship with the motor carrier industry is able to collect truck travel time data that is regarded as proprietary in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proprietary data needed for the contemplated FPM effort is deemed to be available only from the original source (technology vendor) used in previous research, and the contemplated FPM effort is a logical follow-on to the previous work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ATRI is the only transportation research agency that is directly affiliated with the American Trucking Association (ATA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ATRI's relationship / affiliation with ATA uniquely positions ATRI to have access to over 35,000 motor carriers through the affiliated trucking associations in 50 states and to foster collaboration and cooperation with the trucking industry----all of which is indispensable to the success of the contemplated FPM effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through this relationship with industry ATRI is able to gain access to proprietary satellite location data and derive non-proprietary data and information on travel speed and travel time reliability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ATRI research team processes the proprietary data into non-proprietary data and information that FHWA uses for monitoring performance in one of its strategic goals and inform decisions on better managing congestion on the highway transportation system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Employing a new data collection methodology and new source of data would result in issues with accuracy and comparability of data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key to being able to meet the agency's data requirement in a timely manner is the establishment of a long-term contract to facilitate the continuous acquisition of the proprietary data and processing of the data into a non-proprietary format.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through previous efforts the ATRI research team has demonstrated a unique capability to gain access to proprietary data from commercial trucking firms and to use it to measure travel rates and travel time on freight significant highways in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The initial research ATRI completed for the FHWA involved the production of a major data management system consisting of highly specialized processing software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the highly specialized software developed for processing and managing data, and because of the nature of the data (proprietary data that belongs to the freight industry), and because of the unique relationship ATRI has with the trucking industry, and because of the FHWA's requirement for no lapse in data collection - ATRI is considered to be the only organization that is capable of performing the contemplated FPM effort. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned overwhelming factual basis logically favoring ATRI as the only organization capable of satisfactorily executing the contract modification envisioned herein, any organization&nbsp;other than ATRI believes that it can perform this project, then any such other organization shall submit a statement of their capabilities and qualifications, which demonstrates their ability to successfully perform this effort. All responses must be recived by COB (5:00PM EST) on April 15, 2011. All questions concerning this matter should be addressed directly to Ms. Jennifer Johnson at <a href="mailto:jennifer.johnson@dot.gov">jennifer.johnson@dot.gov</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IN APPROXIMATELY 15 DAY's, THE SOLICITATION FOR THIS SERVICE PROJECT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO VIEW AND PRINT. </strong></p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The 2007 Castle Rock Fire burned approximately 48,000 acres of Sawtooth National Forest and Twin Falls District-BLM public lands including the southern and western edges of the Bald Mountain ski area. The wildfire left hundreds of thousands of fire-weakened Douglas-fir within the fire perimeter. These stressed trees have become the perfect host for Douglas-fir bark beetles. Healthy Douglas-fir in and near the Bald Mountain Ski Area are now in jeopardy of becoming infested by beetles because of their susceptibility and proximity to exploding populations of beetles emerging from fire-stressed Douglas-fir. In 2010, to protect large diameter Douglas-fir trees from Douglas-fir beetle, Bald Mountain Ski Area was treated with the Douglas-fir beetle anti-aggregate 3-methyl-2-cyclohexene-1-one (MCH) flakes.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to continue protection of large diameter Douglas-fir (DF) trees from Douglas-fir beetle attack by evenly distributing plastic flakes laminated with MCH across the treatment area to prevent arriving beetles from colonizing DF host trees.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK </strong></p>
<p>The work under this contract consists of the deployment of MCH flakes evenly across the designated treatment area. This includes labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, clean-up, rehabilitation, and incidentals to complete all facets of the contract. The entire area to be treated is 1,500 acres plus or minus 15%. Work must be accomplished between the dates of May 24 and June 17, 2011 subject to weather or other circumstances beyond the Contractor's control.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATIONS</strong> <br /><br />The lands to be treated within the project area are in mountainous terrain with elevation ranging from 5,500 ft. to 9,200 ft. The treatment unit is 1,500 &plusmn;15% acres on and around the Bald Mountain Ski Area near Ketchum, Idaho.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTACT KATHY MATTHEWS, (208) 373-4239 FOR MORE INFORMATION. </span></strong></p>
<p>CONTRACT TIME WILL BE 3 calendar days with an estimated start date of 05/24/2011 through 06/24/2011. NAICS Code: 115310 Size Standard: $7.0. This proposed procurement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS set aside.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC/WSTF has a requirement for continuation of environmental services at theWhite Sands Test Facility.NASA intends to purchase these services from Enterprise Avdisory Services, Inc. (Easi),the current provider under NNJ06HC02C, the Facility Operations and Support Contract(FOSC). Easi was awarded the current contract through a Small-Business Set-Asidecompetitive procurement process in 2006.  The current contract period of performance endsApril 30, 2011. FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) states that full and open competition need not be provided whenthe services required by the Agency may be deemed to be available only from the originalsource in the case of a follow-on contract, for the continued provision of highlyspecialized services and when it is likely that award to any other source would result inunacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements. Therefore, under thestatutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Government intends to award the bridgeactivity to Enterprise Advisory Services, Inc., the sole source of these services for thegap period until the Follow-on Environmental Compliance and Operations Contract isactive. To award this bridge activity to any other source at this time would put WSTFenvironmental operations at risk as Easi is the only provider of these services who isfamiliar with WSTF's processes, procedures and the current regulations regarding WSTFenvironmental compliance and restoration. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon April 15, 2011.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) awarded a Purchase Order dated 22 March 2011, via a limited competition basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, to Eckert &amp; Zeigler Analytics, Inc., 1380 Seaboard Industrial BLVD, Atlanta, GA 30318, for the purchase of radioactive materials.
<p>Limited competition determination was based on the potential for severe financial harm to several Government agencies due to a potential for a significant delay of a testing campaign which will utilize the radioactive materials. NIST has entered into an interagency agreement with the Department of Homeland Security as a part of a Test and Evaluation Campaign of certain instruments. Other agencies are also involved in this campaign. These sources/radioactive materials are being used for calibration, characterization and verification of radiation detection systems performance as well as part of a proficiency test to assess laboratories' testing capabilities. The radiation detection systems will also be tested against ANSI standards N42.35 and N42.38. If the radioactive materials are not received, by April 12, 2011, there will be financial harm in the amount of approximately $1.0M for rescheduling. This financial harm will effect the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency</p>
<p>(a) Authority.<br />(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2).<br />(2) When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.<br />(b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where<br />(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competitions, and<br />(2) Delay in award of a contract would results in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.<br />(c) Limitations.<br />(1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.<br />(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.<br /><br />NIST received the request from Department of Homeland Security in November of 2010; however, it took NIST several months of extensive market research to locate the required uncalibrated radioactive materials. As the lead time for these materials is approximately 2-4 weeks from date of order and the planned testing was to begin in April of 2011, there was not sufficient time to process this order under the regulations governing this type of procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with TSI Incorporated of Saint Paul, Minnesota for the purchase of an Airborne Nanoparticle Measurement System under other than full and open competition. <br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The TSI airborne nanoparticle measurement system is a major component of a much larger system already purchased by NIST from TSI. The new system will be used in conjunction with the existing larger system to allow a more accurate measurement and to increase the flexibility of the overall system. The airborne nanoparticle measurement system will be 100% compatible and require no adjustments to work with the existing TSI system currently at NIST. Deviations away from the TSI system would cause needless replication of key equipment, compatibility issues and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in both hardware and man-hours. TSI Incorporated is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system. As a result, TSI Incorporated is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on April 14, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Medical Neurogenetics, 1 Dunwoody Park, Suite 250, Atlanta, Georgia 30338-6723 to provide genetic testing for Undiagnosed Diseases Program for rare and new genetic disorders, specifically, cerebral spinal fluid.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. 

The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. The DIR-NHGRI- Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238 are connected to this clinical testing.  Under this protocol, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. To date, the Undiagnosed Diseases program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 15% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date. Ongoing research continues to find diagnosis on the other patients who have been seen in the UDP to date.

Medical Neurogenetics Laboratories (MNG) is a CLIA-certified biochemical and molecular laboratory providing expert interpretations, and prompt reporting of rare or new genetic disorders, specifically found only in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Medical Neurogenetics (MNG) is a diagnostic laboratory functioning as an independent lab, research and clinical facility. MNG has devoted its efforts exclusively to providing biochemical and molecular testing for genetic disorders and inborn errors of metabolism found only in CSF for clinical and research programs around the country. Most of the programs MNG interacts with have complex clinical trials and/or patients with uncharacterized disorders like the patients seen here in the Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP). Accordingly, the MNG organization, staff, facilities, and work methods have been developed for the purpose of supporting clinical diagnostics and research, resulting in a high level of specialized expertise.  MNG supports the goals of the UDP and are unique because they have developed assays for CSF and can perform complex biochemical and molecular testing for a large range of genetic disorders across the lifespan with particular attention to research and diagnosis of CSF diseases that is not offered elsewhere in the United States. 

Contractor Requirements:

1.  The Contractor will provide a wide-range of tests as outlined in the attachment with family follow up as needed, as well as supports the ongoing collaborative research expertise needed by the NHGRI, UDP. 

2.  The Contractor will provide unique services specific to complex mitochondrial disorders as well as deletion and duplications studies for multiple rare biochemical disorders that meets the program goals of the UDP.

3.  The Contractors turn-around-time for UDP to receive results will be 2-4 weeks. 

4.  The Government will be contacted if any patient results need to be evaluated urgently for impact on caring for patients in the UDP.

5.  The Contractor will supply faxed copies of all patient reports for the study file and medical record.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology Branch (ORBP), within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institute of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 253-(1) and FAR 6.302 - 1(a)(2)(ii), a new contract for the continuation of the Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) Center - Lorazepam for Treatment of Status Epilepticus to the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington, D.C. A new contract is necessary for CNMC's continuation of effort in order to enroll an adequate number of patients and acquire the additional time to complete the study analysis. <br /><br />The study consists of two sequential phases: Study 1 is a pharmacokinetic study (which has been completed) and Study 2 is a double blind safety and efficacy trial. The results from this study will provide the scientific basis for the determination of the lorazepam dose that is used in the efficacy trial.
<p>The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-109) was enacted to enhance pediatric clinical studies leading to new pediatric labeling in accordance with FDA rules and regulations. Lorazepam as therapy for pediatric (SE) has been chosen by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and in consultation with the Commissioner of the FDA and experts in pediatric research, as a priority "off-patent" drug for which pediatric studies are most urgently needed.</p>
<p>In recognition of the unique circumstances pertaining to research in emergency situations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established regulations that provide a narrow exception to the requirement for informed consent from subjects or their legally authorized representatives in such situations. These regulations, known as the Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) for Emergency Research (21 CFR 50.24), are harmonized with the regulations set forth by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and known as the Waiver of Informed Consent Requirements in Certain Emergency Research (45 CFR 46.101(i)).</p>
<p>Since this study is the first to be conducted under a waiver from informed consent, the experience accrued by the current investigators will inform the implementation of future studies performed in life-threatening conditions in pediatrics. <br /><br />Award to new contractors would interrupt continuity in enrollment, collection of information and activities required by 21 CFR 50.24 and thus compromise their ability to complete the study in a timely and fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the lack of precedence in the implementation of procedures and the process for community involvement mandated under 21 CFR 50.24, provided the current group of investigators with the incentive to innovate and create a well structured program that includes activities to be conducted at the end of the study.</p>
<p>A separate contractor, unlikely to be familiar with the process, would be required to develop and complete an EFIC plan and program for each site with consequent delays and lack of continuity. It would cost the Government significant time and effort to train, recruit and duplicate the expertise acquired by CNMC over the past six and half years.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Ms. Carol Rodeffer, 3093 D. Woodrow Street, Arlington, VA  22206, for the recruitment, assessment, and research coordination of patients selected for the SCID/DNA Arm of the NIMH Genetic Study of Schizophrenia.

The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB)/Genes, Cognition and Psychosis Program (GCAP) is seeking a social worker to be directly involved in a project that explores the genetics of schizophrenia that involves subject eligibility determination for four CBDB/NIMH protocols and two drug studies, patient screening and recruitment (schizophrenics, siblings, parents and healthy controls), on-site and off-site DNA sample collection, assessment and research coordination, and review of medical, psychiatric records, and represent CBDB at local and national conferences.  Considerable skill is required to coordinate the research participation for the SCID/DNA arm of the outpatient genetic study of the Genes, Cognition and Psychosis/ Clinical Brain Disorders Branch.  The study requires specialized knowledge of the genetic study of schizophrenia and clinical skills to assess the appropriateness of a candidate and whether or not they meet the competency requirements to give informed consent.  Knowledge of and testing procedures and NIH policies governing research with human subjects is also imperative.  The Contractor to perform this requirement must also have the therapeutic skills to build the necessary alliances with very impaired individuals to assure their voluntary participation and informed decisions.   In completing the FIGs analysis of families, a great deal of diagnostic expertise is required.  

Ms. Carol Rodeffer has been part of the original research team that launched protocol 95-M-0150, the Genetic Study of Schizophrenia.  She has developed specialized knowledge and skills pertinent to this protocol and has served as an associate investigator on the study since 1998.  She has continued to work for the outpatient genetic study since that date and has been the chief coordinator for the SCID/DNA arm of the study.  Ms. Rodeffer has also recruited for the inpatient and outpatient programs and has screened for healthy volunteers for the Genetic study as well.  Because of her long-standing and considerable knowledge of the illness of schizophrenia and expertise in working with the patients and their families, she is considered uniquely qualified and a sole source for continuing to recruit patients and to coordinate the SCID/DNA research arm of the study.  Allowing her to retain her role on the research team also allows for the continuity of contact, which is necessary in building therapeutic research alliances for this target research population.  Changing research coordinators at this point in time would result in unnecessary delays in services and risk a less than satisfactory delivery of service.  Therefore, it is determined that Ms. Rodeffer is the only source qualified to perform the required services. 
 
The Period of Performance is 12 months with 2 additional 1-year option period(s).  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 11:00 AM E.T., April 11, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2023595 on all correspondence.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Ann Reifman, Ph.D., 3000 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC  20008 for the professional services of a clinician with expertise in schizophrenia to be a part of NIMHs research project investigating schizophrenia and genetics.
   
The Clinical Brain Disorders Branch (CBDB)/Genes, Cognition and Psychosis Program (GCAP) is seeking a Clinical Psychologist to be directly involved in a project that aims to screen potential CBDB Sibling Study participants, perform SCID evaluations for mental health diagnoses on probands and healthy controls,  modify and tailor the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders to better reflect the needs of the research, develop an interview process to give the severely mental ill subjects the ability to answer deep probing questions and establish and monitor inter-rater reliability among those performing various diagnostic assessments.

Dr. Reifman is highly qualified in the field of treating patients with schizophrenia.  Starting in 1970, she was a Social Science Analyst at the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia and later at the Neuropsychiatry Branch, both in NIMH.  Dr. Reifman also coordinated a Clinical Psychology Internship which focused on the treatment of people with severe mental illness. She was voted by mental health specialists (including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers) in the Washington, D.C. area to be one of a handful of top therapists for people with schizophrenia.  Based on her previous experiences and involvement with the studies at NIMH, Dr. Reifman is considered highly qualified and the best candidate for the requirement.  

The Period of Performance is 5 months with 2 additional 1-year option period(s).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit InterMed Video Technologies, Inc, 18 Commerce Rd Newtown, Ct 06470-1607 on a sole source basis for a firm-fixed price contract for a base quantity of six (6) each 17 inc (Part Number 90200036) and ten (10) each 10.4 inch (Part Number 90200035) ruggedized commercial of the shelf LCD displays to accomplish Craft Alterations on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) in support of the LCAC C4N Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  The contract will have provisions for purchase of up to an additional twenty-seven (27) 17 inch displays and forty-six (46) 10.4 inch displays that may be purchased under orders issued under the contract.
  The initial order will be placed on the base award and the additional quantities over two additional award terms.  The prices for the award terms will be evaluated at time of contract award.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The parts being purchased are slightly modified COTS items manufactured by InterMed Video Technologies of Newtown, Ct.   Inter Med Video is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these items.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC System Upgrade and the SLEP displays and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same units for the remaining craft.
  This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the display signals of the LCAC systems.  These installed displays are integrated into the display console and craft wiring, and are compatible with the Alarm Monitoring System AMS, Sperry Bridgemaster E Radar, Radar Interface Converter Unit (RICU), Navigation Processor Unit NPU, and Navigation Data Integrator NDI.  Other displays would require craft rewiring, qualification and extensive re-testing.  Also, the current required delivery dates would not support the development effort that would be required.  Delivery for the base quantity is 30 weeks after award to the Receiving Officer, Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSA PC) 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407.
  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.

FISCN Contracting Department is taking this action in an effort to improve both vendor access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time bids. All responsible vendors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com. Vendors who require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com.
 Vendors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the FedBid process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive process.

  The contractor shall retain title to the surrogate UAS (to include the aircraft and all equipment) at all times. The surrogate UAS (to include the aircraft and all equipment) shall be under the control of contractor personnel at all times.  The contractor will be required to provide and operate the surrogate systems.

The resultant contract will include three (3) options for surrogate unmanned aircraft systems to support for training events in Bridgeport, CA in June 2011, Ft Irwin, CA in August 2011, and Ft Polk, LA in September 2011.
 
It is expected that this procurement will result in the placement of a single FFP contract using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR PART 13.5.  The NAlCS code for this requirement is 488190, and the small business size standard is $7,000,000.00.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Division of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance (DECA) in New York, NY, intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part Thirteen, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to FLIR Systems, Incorporated of North Billerica, Massachusetts.  This purchase order will provide a FLIR GF320 infrared (IR) camera with one year of service.
The EPA currently uses FLIR IR cameras in support of EPA's air toxics initiative.  These cameras are specific and compatible with EPA investigative procedures for air toxics and volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring under EPA Reference Method 21.  The only other known manufacturer of gas imaging cameras does not offer a product that is suitably portable for DECA's investigative requirements.
The FLIR GF320 is only available directly from the manufacturer and, thus, FLIR Systems is the only source available for this purchase.
No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response; which, if received before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  
Responses to this posting must be made in writing.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions should be directed to Christine Cervellieri via email (see below).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The intent of this project is to construct a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) room for the US Attorney's Office (USAO) on the sixth floor at the Minneapolis Federal Courthouse. A SCIF is a Justice Management Division (JMD) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) accredited area, room, group of rooms, buildings, or installation where sensitive compartmented information (SCI) may be stored, used, discussed, and/or electronically processed. The physical security protection for a SCIF is intended to prevent as well as detect visual, acoustical, technical, and physical access by unauthorized persons. USAO SCIFs should preferably be located in the central interior spaces of the USAO office suites, and away from adjacent public spaces such as corridors, halls, lobbies, atriums, building shafts, and building exterior walls.</p>
<p>A firm fixed price contract will be awarded for the aforementioned services. Performance based contracting does not apply to this procurement as this acquisition is for construction services. The estimated project magnitude is between $25,000 and $100,000. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million. This project will be procured as Small Business set-aside. This solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available via the internet only. No hard copies will be mailed.

It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as Central Contract Registration (CCR), and is available for use by all Federal agencies. All government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award, as of October 1, 2003. You may access CCR at www.bpn.gov. On January 1, 2005 all vendors are required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process per the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).

A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  The VA Hospital in Milwaukee Wisconsin has a requirement for a one time purchase for the New SCI building of 31 Stryker S3 Medical Surgical (MedSurg) Patriot Beds with associated equipment (scale, bed exit, zone control, chaperone bed exit high tone siren, pendant fully loaded , Stryker pendant port, side-rail communication package with CC outside GF, docker cables, quick start guide, 110 volt outlets, adapter brackets for patient help, roller bumpers, wall saver, removable IV poles). The approximate cost is $262,583.22 

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) due to Unusual and compelling urgency.

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The VA Hospital in Milwaukee, WI, requires this product because it is the only Medical Surgical (MedSurg) bed that has:  1. An electric bed with a retractable frame, particularly at the head of the bed. This is essential when raising the head and neck, because it leaves the proximal area unchanged, reducing the need for repositioning.  2. The SCI buildings entire environmental control units were customized specifically for this exact model and it is not believed that any cost savings thru competition of a lesser brand would be such that it would be enough to recoup costs to further customize the control units thru construction or modification. 3. Television arms are customized to this exact model.  4.  Without these beds the patients will not be able to utilize the sip-puff technology used to control the TV, the phone, the nurse-call system, the lights and the bed positioning. 5. Without a retractable frame, spinal cord patients will not be able to use television and computer arm functions without repositioning from staff members.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  This will be posted to FBO. If another company is able to provide all required functions and meet compatibility requirements they can submit a compatibility statement to the Contracting Officer for review. If no company is able to meet the requirements and or are deemed not technically competent, then this will proceed as a sole source to the above named contractor.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Overall pricing will be compared to contractor's list prices and to previous awards for similar items.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The technical team at the Milwaukee WI VAMC conducted a thorough examination of all beds before submitting their request, they did not find another company that met their requirements. A search of GSA by the KO did not reveal any beds that met the requirements of the SCI staff. 



 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
For 31 Stryker S3 Medical Surgical (MedSurg) Patriot Beds with associated equipment for the New Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) building at the Milwaukee Wisconsin VAMC

9.	Other facts:  There is no other reasonable or practicable approach that VA can utilize to accomplish the things identified herein. The purchase of this patient bed would allow for more efficient and independent patient adjustment and less chance of patient and caregiver injury due to repositioning. The patients to fill the beds at the SCI due to the extent of their injuries need as little handling as possible and these beds meet that requirement.

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  The technical staff at the SCI investigated other companies but due to the nature of their requirements it is not expected that any other company will express interest due the fact that they are not able to meet our needs.

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  This will be posted to FBO for public viewing.

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Location and tracking technology for the first responder community is potentially a major contributor to reductions in loss of life and property due to fire. In order to prioritize the deployment of limited resources, an incident commander requires accurate and reliable information about the position and status of fire fighters inside a structure and, given the harsh operating environment, rapid intervention teams need to be able to rescue trapped and/or injured fire fighters as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing test methodology for evaluating the performance of fire fighter location and tracking systems. To this end, NIST is planning to purchase location and tracking systems (LTS) to help guide the development of the tests. Since LTS are currently a very active area of research and development, and there are several very different approaches being pursued to determine the geospatial position of fire fighters in GPS-denied environments, NIST is seeking sources of LTS that are commercially available or will be ready for commercial sale within 60 days and is requesting information about the technological approach used to determine position. Ultimately, the goal is to acquire several LTS, each of which employs a different technological approach. The number of LTS purchased will depend on funding availability. NIST has previously acquired an LTS that uses GPS-corrected inertial technology for fire fighter positioning, therefore an additional purchase of this combination of technologies will be redundant and will not be considered at this time.</p>
<p>To be considered for this project, the LTS must conform to the following technical specifications:<br />1. The LTS shall be fully functional in a GPS-denied environment.<br />2. The LTS shall be capable of locating at least 4 fire fighters simultaneously.<br />3. The LTS shall be fully functional in an environment in which flames, heat, smoke, dust and water are present.<br />4. The LTS shall not employ GPS-corrected inertial technology for determining position.<br />5. The LTS shall include a user interface and all necessary software, clips, harnesses, batteries, chargers, etc... for full operation.<br />6. The LTS shall provide position location to the user in near-real time.<br />7. The total cumulative weight of all body-worn LTS components shall be less than 4.5 kg per person.<br />8. The LTS shall locate the position of fire fighters in three dimensions.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334519, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. If two or more small businesses are identified, we will consider a set-aside.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture LTS, meeting the above technical specifications, are requested to email product literature and a letter describing their technological approach in enough detail to determine whether the LTS is representative of a particular location technology or combination of technologies to andrea.parekh@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The letter shall include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br />1. Name and size of the company that manufactures the LTS for which specifications are provided.<br />2. Name of the company(ies) that are authorized to sell the LTS, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number, and email address).<br />3. Indication of the number of days after the receipt of the order that is typical for delivery of such LTS.<br />4. Indication of whether each LTS for which specifications are sent to andrea.parekh@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).<br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documents must be sent to Andrea Parekh, contract specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. Email address: andrea.parekh@nist.gov.</p>
<p>Submission must be received not later than 3:00 pm local time on April 14, 2011.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541611, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of performing survey services for government agencies.</p>
<p>NIST Mfg. Ext. Partnership (MEP) Survey</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program (MEP), a program of the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a nationwide network that provides services to assist smaller manufacturers in becoming globally competitive. The network consists of 60 manufacturing extension centers serving all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Each MEP center is an independent, non-profit organization offering products and services that meet the specific needs of the region's local manufacturers.</p>
<p>Evaluation is a key element of all MEP programs and activities to continuously improve on current services and report successful activities or areas of needed improvement. The MEP centers cumulatively assist between 8,000 and 12,000 manufacturers in a typical year. Customers of each MEP center are surveyed between six months and one year after receiving services. The survey is conducted primarily via a web-based instrument, but clients have the option to call in to the survey vendor to complete the survey over the phone. The survey asks customers to comment on the impact the Center's assistance has had on the firm. Survey questions are developed by NIST MEP and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Results of this survey are used to evaluate the performance of individual centers. Results are also cumulated across all centers to provide indicators of program success at the national level.</p>
<p>The results of this survey are mission-critical, as they are mandatory per the regulations governing the operation of the MEP Program. Results are reported to Congress annually to continue justification and funding of the MEP system. Results are also used to evaluate MEP Centers and are an input into the decision on continued funding for each center.</p>
<p><br />II. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>To provide various survey services for NIST MEP on a quarterly basis in order to capture the necessary data to evaluate the centers and the MEP program, including administration of the NIST MEP Client Impact Survey.</p>
<p>III. STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>Task 1: Pre-Survey Data Preparation</p>
<p>The major sub-tasks involved are:</p>
<p>1-1. Consolidation and storage of data records for survey<br />1-2. Review of Survey Input File<br />1-3. Preparation of survey cover letters and activity lists<br />1-4. Mailing of pre-survey package to respondent<br />1-5. Final preparation of project records for survey interviewers</p>
<p>Sub-Task 1-1: Consolidation and storage of data records for survey</p>
<p>NIST MEP collects detailed project records from its Centers regarding their interactions with clients. This data includes contact information for the client firms and details regarding the type of services received. It is organized in a flat file database with each record representing an individual project with a particular client.</p>
<p>The records also include more detailed information about the client and the projects.</p>
<p>The survey organization will need to store both current and historic records in order to prepare the customized project lists and cover letters for each client. All the project records shall contain a center code field and client unique identifier field that can be concatenated to generate a unique identifier for each client. This unique identifier shall be used to identify all project records for each client.</p>
<p>All client data is considered confidential. The survey organization will need to ensure that this data is properly secured and encrypted to prevent unwanted disclosure of any MEP client data.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 1-2: Review of Survey Input File</p>
<p>The contractor will have to review all data records submitted by centers individually prior to preparation of project lists and cover letters to ensure that minimum professional standards are maintained. These standards include correct spelling, appropriate use of capitalization and punctuation, and no embarrassing or inappropriate content in project titles (i.e. Ms. Instead of Mr.).</p>
<p>The contractor should assign staff with appropriate customer service skills and technical knowledge to perform data confirmation process.</p>
<p>The contractor will work with NIST on a continuous basis to improve the data confirmation process.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 1-3: Preparation of Survey Cover Letters</p>
<p>The contractor will need a process for each MEP Center to submit letterhead, envelopes, and a signature of an appropriate center official which can be scanned and printed on to the survey letters with the appropriate center official title. The process shall allow for ad hoc updates from Centers as well. A formal plan for an annual update from every center, regardless of whether the center has made changes, will also be required. The contractor will allow center director titles and signatures to be customized.</p>
<p>Careful quality control to ensure that the appropriate stationery and signature is matched with each client is required. Cover letters must be consistently free of errors. Each quarter NIST MEP staff must review a sample of all materials before they are sent out to clients.</p>
<p>The letter text itself is standard across all Centers and shall be used on all letters.</p>
<p>The contractor shall generate a customized project list for each client based on the data sent by NIST. The contractor will also prepare a questionnaire that is included in the pre-survey package sent to each client selected for survey. These items are to be included in both the mail and email versions of the package.</p>
<p>Email versions of the Survey Cover Letters must also be available for center use, either as the primary initial contact with the client, or for center staff to generate to send to clients as reminders. The email versions of the cover letter must be in a text format (no attachments allowed) and shall include a live link with an embedded username and password to the individual client's unique survey. The email system will include basic email tracking mechanisms, including a notification or status showing if an email has been bounced back or delivery of the email has failed. The email must also include the generated customized project list similar to what is included in the mailed version of the letter.</p>
<p>Pre-survey materials will be mailed/emailed approximately a week before the survey opens. A schedule of when emails and letters are to be distributed will be provided to the vendor, and any deviation from the schedule is not allowed.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 1-4: Mailing and Emailing of Pre-Survey Package to Respondent</p>
<p>Once the cover letters, project lists and question list have been produced, they must be reviewed and approved by NIST MEP staff. The email template must also be reviewed and approved by NIST MEP staff before sending. The contractor should give careful consideration to the design of a process that will guarantee the proper letters will be matched to the proper project lists, envelopes and stationery.</p>
<p>Pre-survey packages will be mailed no less than 5 and no more than 10 business days prior to the beginning of data collection.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 1-5: Final Preparation of Project Records for Survey Interviewers</p>
<p>The contractor will make all of the relevant data available in some for to the interviewers so that it can be reviewed immediately prior to conducting the survey. The contractor will program all data elements into the Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system and the web-based survey instrument.</p>
<p>Task 2: Data Collection</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that standardized, time-tested quality assurance protocols will be in place. The data collection process breaks down into six subtasks: program CATI and web-based systems, prepare alternative survey administration methods, train interviewers, prepare web surveys, conduct the interviews, and track the data collection process to communicate with MEP centers. The base survey will contain no more than 20 questions. A random sample of clients may be asked more detailed questions in addition to the base survey.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-1: Program Survey Instrument</p>
<p>The latest available technology for the survey instrument must be used. The survey instrument should be designed following the current generally accepted standards for user-friendliness (examples: no scrolling, multiple related questions on one screen, and the ability for the end user to easily review and print a summary of what they reported). The survey instrument must be able to have multiple questions on one screen, and access/availability of certain answers must be based on selected answers. For example, if a client selects "no," then the dollar amount input field on the same screen must be "grayed out" or inaccessible for data entry. The system must be one seamless integrated system using only one type of software, with no merging or manual manipulation of files. The web-based survey must be operational and easily accessed by clients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Server down time is not acceptable, and appropriate backups should be in place to ensure the survey is accessible at all times. The survey contractor will be required to keep an off-site backup server in order to keep the web survey up and running in the event of emergency, power outage, natural disaster, etc., at the survey vendor's home office. This off-site backup must keep the web-based survey up and running in the event the main server goes down, and must be activated within 5 minutes of the main server going down. The off-site backup server must be a distance far enough away from the vendor's home office so that in the event of an emergency, it is highly unlikely that the off-site backup server would be affected. The off-site backup should be part of a Continuing of Operations Plan (COOP).</p>
<p>The survey instrument should be designed in such a manner as to allow for quick and easy updating of survey questions, and should have the ability to ask different sets of questions based on certain criteria (such as type of project work completed).</p>
<p>The survey instrument must display the appropriate center logo for each individual survey, based on which center completed the projects with the client.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-2: Prepare Alternate Survey Administration Methods</p>
<p>When clients to be surveyed can not or will not complete the survey via web, the contractor shall provide alternative methods of data collection, including telephone interview, emailed version of the survey, or fax. The contractor will be responsible for any data entry tasks associated with these alternative methods.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-3: Training Interviewers</p>
<p>The contractor shall assign professional, experienced interviewers to use on this requirement. Prior to data collection, the contractor must provide training to the interviewers. Special emphasis should be place on the unique relationship between NIST MEP, the individual centers, and the center's clients. The NIST project manager should have the opportunity to monitor and/or attend these training sessions.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-4: Survey Instrument</p>
<p>In addition to the initial programming performed under sub-task 2-1, the contractor shall prepare the survey instrument to ensure the Center names are correct and that the appropriate logos are uploaded to the web system. The contractor shall also test the system to ensure the exclusion program is working properly so that clients completing the survey via the web instrument are also not contacted by a live interviewer. This requires a real-time status update in the center and administrative portals. The contractor should be able to conduct multiple versions of the survey concurrently. These versions can vary based on the types of projects completed by clients, and will consist of a core set of questions across all surveys followed by substance-specific questions for that particular client.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also provide a test or sample web-based survey to NIST MEP and MEP center reporting and evaluation staff for continuous use and review.</p>
<p><br />Sub-Task 2-5: Conduct Survey</p>
<p>Each quarter, the contractor will conduct the survey over a four week period. The contractor should follow established protocols that have been successfully implemented in prior survey quarters. The contractor will provide NIST MEP the opportunity to monitor survey calls in real-time. The contractor should have the capacity to administer the surveys in Spanish. The contractor will record all telephone interviews and provide copies of these interviews to NIST MEP within 1 business day of the request. The survey will not be required to make outbound calls to clients, but must have an adequate number of interviewers ready in the event a client calls in to complete the survey. Clients shall not be kept on hold for longer than 30 seconds. A schedule of the survey periods will be provided to the vendor, and no deviations from this schedule are allowed.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-6: Maintain Survey Database</p>
<p>The contractor will track the completion status of each client and provide a general description of why a client has not completed the survey. Description is only required for CATI interviews where applicable. Client survey completion status reports will be provided by the contractor on a real-time basis via the Center Portals in Sub-Task 2-7. The completion status should be updated immediately once the survey is completed.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 2-7: Center Portals</p>
<p>The contractor will provide a web-based data portal for all MEP centers. Within this portal, MEP centers will have access to client data and real-time survey completion status. This portal will also have a function to allow center staff to generate the Survey Cover Letter emails to clients, which contain a live link to the survey. This portal will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during the survey period. The portal should be easily customizable to allow different access rights (such as administrator, view-only, etc) to different staff members, and each center must only be able to view their center-specific data. Certain MEP Center staff will need to have the ability to edit client contact information. The portal will only allow each MEP center access to its own clients. A portal with administrative access to all clients and information is required for NIST MEP staff.</p>
<p>Task 3: Post-Survey Reporting</p>
<p>NIST MEP expects that survey data will be made available no later than 7 days after each survey data collection period is completed.</p>
<p>Raw data output files should be supplied to NIST MEP in flat file format. The contractor will be responsible for providing the data file in a NIST MEP-specified format. The data file must be error-free due to tight NIST MEP deadlines, and the upload to the NIST MEP system must be successful on the first attempt. The output file must come directly from the database, and must be ready to export without any manual intervention or file merging.</p>
<p>Task 4: Overall Management</p>
<p>Sub-Task 4-0: Reporting to NIST Project Manager</p>
<p>The contractor will provide monthly written progress updates to the NIST project manager. These will be provided as documentation of project status regardless of the amount of contact between the NIST project manager and the contractor.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 4-1: Communicating With MEP Centers</p>
<p>The contractor must develop strong relationships with the centers through designing training tools and methods of communication to help MEP Centers understand and use the survey process properly or by any other acceptable method. Periodic email updates to the Centers, online presentation materials that provide an overview of different aspects of the process, and presentations at various MEP meetings shall be provided in the communication. NIST MEP and the contractor will work together to design and deliver ongoing communication and training messages. The contractor shall also be expected to engage in proactive identification of additional communication efforts that will aid the survey's success.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 4-2: Continuous Improvement of Methodology</p>
<p>The contractor shall arrange for regular debriefing of interviewers with the goal of improving the protocol. Immediate changes can be made to the instrument and the protocol as a result of these debriefings with the written permission of the NIST project manager. Other ideas for improvement can also be implemented as identified, with the written permission of the NIST project manager.</p>
<p>Sub-Task 4-3: Quality Control and Customer Service</p>
<p>The contractor currently have in place rigorous quality control procedures and demonstrate how those procedures will be applied to the NIST MEP survey contract. Quality control is of utmost performance in order to uphold the professional image of NIST MEP, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the MEP Centers. Emails sent to clients must be error-free (including but not limited to proper grammar and spelling, proper names and titles, neatly folded envelopes, and properly aligned printing). The survey instrument must be grammatically correct with proper spelling and portray a professional image. MEP center staff must have their questions and concerns addressed within one business day. Clients taking the survey must have their calls answered within 30 seconds and not be placed on hold for more than 30 seconds.</p>

<SOLNBR>M6785411R8056

<ARCHDATE>05152011
<CONTACT>Robert Daniel Dague, robert.dague@usmc.mil
<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS) is seeking to identify sources capable of manufacturing a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) four-wheel drive autonomous Robotic  Moving Target System (R-MTS).  This free ranging robotic target system will be used during live fire training on USMC ranges.  This robotic target system will consist of a suite of four to eight robots that can execute complex pre-planned scenarios, moving in and out of buildings through doorways and having the ability to move anywhere on the surface of a range with up to 7 (seven degree) slope that a human could walk without climbing steps.  Upon being shot by service ammunition of calibers 9mm, 5.56mm, .300 Winchester Magnum, and 7.62mm a robot must provide instant visual feedback to the shooter and wireless telemetry feedback to the instructor.
   Robot targets must demonstrate environmental awareness of the terrain and man-made structures such that they will sense and avoid obstacles and be able to seek concealment and cover behind structures when fired upon.  The robots movement may not be confined to tracks or bounded lanes but rather they must have the ability to roam freely within a two dimensional area defined as a play-box.  The system must be capable of operating day and night for continuous periods of up to six hours at a time.  The robots are required to be human-like in size, shape and speed.  The robot target must provide a 3-D human mannequin for the upper portion of the body beginning at the hips while the lower portion of the robot below the hips may be a rolling chassis.
  The human sized 3-D mannequin must be capable of sustaining hundreds of impacts from 7.62mm bullets round hundreds of times before being replaced.  A robotic target system is considered autonomous if the robots can move using path-finding and obstacle avoidance algorithms to simulate the movements of foot-mobile human beings.  This definition excludes static pop-up targets, targets confined to rails or guides, mobile targets requiring human-in-the-loop control of the targets movement.  Additionally, this system must operate without any additional infrastructure such as rails, magnets, fiduciary markers (e.g. reflectors), or sensing devices external to the robot in order for it to operate.   An autonomous robotic target system must include the following functional components:
Platform  the robotic vehicle (movement platform) which provides mobility over USMC urban and home station training area terrains.
Obstacle avoidance  responsible for detecting and avoiding obstacles, while moving in the desired direction.
Localization  refers to the ability of the vehicle to determine the position relative to a map stored in computer memory.
 
High level control  provides the robots ability to generate long-term plans, such as sequences and way-points or behaviors, to fulfill its goals and mission objectives.
If interested, furnish your detailed response and technical information

<DESC>RFI Number: M67854-11-I-0214
Notice Type: Sources Sought 
Date: 31 March 2011

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI.
 No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

1.0 Introduction: The G/ATOR Program is currently a Special Interest Acquisition Category II program with an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Increment I, Air Defense/Surveillance Radar (AD/SR) provides capabilities in the Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and Air Surveillance mission areas.  Increment II, Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) will address the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) Counterfire Targeting missions.  Increment III, Enhanced Air Defense/Surveillance Radar (EAD/SR) will provide technical enhancements of the air missions; and Increment IV, Expeditionary Airport Surveillance Radar (EASR), will address Air Traffic Control (ATC) missions.
 G/ATOR provides real-time radar measurement data to Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC), Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S), Composite Tracking Network (CTN), and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).  G/ATOR satisfies warfighter's expeditionary needs across the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) spectrum replacing five legacy systems with a single MAGTF solution. Increment III has been deferred and the time line for implementation will be determined at a later date.

1.1 Purpose: This RFI constitutes market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Marine Corps Systems Command is issuing this RFI, as part of the G/ATOR program, to assess industry's capability for the LRIP phase to include eight (8) Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units, Initial Operating Spares for LRIP units, spares to support Development Test (DT) and Initial Operating Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), adhoc Engineering Support Services, as needed, Engineering and Logistics Test Support, and Logistics Planning in support of Government DT and IOT&E.

1.2 Objective: Data submitted in response to this RFI will be used to assess the marketplace environment for providing the USMC with eight (8) G/ATOR systems and other test support as listed in paragraph 1.1 necessary to meet operational testing requirements.
  Presently, USMC has a contract option for obtaining two LRIP G/ATOR systems for the System Design and Development contract; however, there is a need for six (6) additional LRIP units.

2.0 Background: The G/ATOR performance Specification/Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase, including Increment I development, is currently being performed under contract in accordance with the Attachment 1 Government System Design and Development performance specification.  This contract requires the contractor to develop a hardware solution such that no equipment modifications are required to support implementation of follow on increments capabilities. Upgrading the G/ATOR system to add Increment II (GWLR) and IV (EASR) capabilities is planned to be accomplished in the future with the development of mission specific software integrated into the hardware and common radar operations system software.
  The acquisition strategy for future increments is in development and there is no information available to industry at this time. 

2.1.1 Increment I Operational Concept:
As a lightweight, highly mobile, rapidly deployable, and expeditionary Marine Corps ACE asset, Increment I (AD/SR) is the baseline system for the Marine Corps short and medium range radar requirement.  Increment I (AD/SR) is a key component of the Marine Corps Aviation Command and Control (C2) System of Systems (SoS) being developed to support Expeditionary Maneuver From the Sea in joint, MAGTF and coalition environments.  Increment I (AD/SR) provides MAGTF commanders with a highly reliable and maintainable battlespace sensor designed to protect the force from short to medium-range threats by complementing the AN/TPS-59 Long Range Radar.
  Increment Is (AD/SRs) multi-mission capability allows the MAGTF commander to selectively shape air defense zones that join maritime air defense and surveillance areas, reducing vulnerability gaps in the landward sector for naval forces operating in the worlds littoral regions. 

2.1.2 Increment II Operational Concept:
The Increment II (GWLR) will acquire threat indirect fire systems at greater range as well as provide greater accuracy, classification and deployability to fully support MAGTF counterfire and counter battery missions.  The principal functions of the system will be to detect, track, classify, and accurately determine the origin of enemy projectiles.  The Increment II (GWLR) primary mission is to locate enemy rocket, mortar, and artillery weapons and provide acquired enemy locations in a timely manner for counterfire and intelligence purposes.
 The Increment II (GWLR) secondary mission is to adjust and/or register the fires of friendly artillery units. The system will be forward deployed and, depending on the tactical situation, may be employed in any size MAGTF, ranging from Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) to the MEF level. 

2.1.3 Increment IV Operational Concept:
Increment IV (EASR) enhancements will improve G/ATORs overall performance in the areas of Federal Aviation Administration interoperability by allowing EASR facilities to safely and expeditiously move aircraft to and from military and civil airfields and associated airspace. The system's EASR capabilities will meet Federal Aviation Administration standards/requirements for air traffic control systems to include flight inspection, check and certification.
 It will incorporate weather detection capability for near real time advisories for aircrews to increase flight safety and will contain a dual frequency obstruction light visible to aircrew capable of visible red and infrared operation.  Lastly, it will employ a contingency mode which will allow the Increment IV (EASR) to operate independent of the MAGTF C2 node.

2.3 Description of Proposed System: G/ATOR consists of three configuration items (i.e. the Radar Equipment Group (REG), the Communications Equipment Group (CEG) and the Power Equipment Group (PEG) with a Pallet Assembly) along with the basic radar operation and the mission-unique software. The REG and its transporter are designed as an integral towed package.
 The CEG and PEG are mounted on existing Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) vehicles. The current configuration utilizes one MK25 Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) and one M1152 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  Additionally, one Mobile Electric Power (MEP) 806B 60KW generator is provided as GFE. The G/ATOR with GFE vehicles will be employed within the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and tactically moved by driving from one location to another. In addition to tactical movement, the G/ATOR can be configured for transport via MAGTF organic aviation assets such as: C-130, MV-22 or CH-53 or configured for commercial transport via tractor-trailer or rail assets. The software consists of two components; basic radar operations software, common to all increments; and mission software, unique to each of the G/ATOR missions.
 
 
2.4 Key Notional Events: The first LRIP unit will need to be completed and available for Government developmental testing in the third quarter of FY2015, with all eight (8) LRIPs delivered by the third quarter of FY 2017. The program schedule is success oriented in that it assumes a successful MS C decision in third quarter FY2013 and Increment I Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in the second quarter FY16. The successful IOT&E will allow for the start of Full Rate Production (FRP) in a timeframe conducive with meeting Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for all increments by fourth quarter FY2018. Additionally, a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) will be required no later than third quarter FY 2016 to support a Full Rate Production Decision.

2.5 Design, Test and Manufacturing Data: Northrop Grumman was competitively awarded the G/ATOR Increment I System Development and Demonstration contract in March 2007 with options for two LRIPs and up to 15 additional units towards full rate production.
 Northrop Grumman has developed the Government and contractor owned EDM. As such, they are responsible for the design, development, fabrication, and developmental testing of the Increment I hardware and software and will perform all aspects of system integration.  At this stage of the acquisition, Northrop Grumman retains a substantial amount of the data rights for the engineering and design data. Some of the data is proprietary and not releasable.  Northrop Grumman is not required to submit production baseline configuration data to the Government until after the Physical Configuration Audit (PCA).  The Northrop Grumman PCA is scheduled to occur in FY 2016.  Consequently, no design drawings, build to print specifications, quality assurance data, software code, test data, and limited production tooling are available.

3.0 Requested Information: Respondents who are interested are requested to provide information that identifies their capability and ability to: 1) produce the LRIP phase as described in paragraph 1.1 above, 2) certify (through testing), 3) meet the Governments delivery schedule and 4) support eight (8) LRIP units that are fully capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in Attachment 1 and meeting the key notional events as set forth in paragraph 2.3 above.

<DESC><p>The impact of narratives on human psychology ranges widely from what events we remember most easily to our choices about important foundational behaviors to include our degree of trust in others. Since the brain is the proximate cause of our actions, narratives have a direct impact on the neurobiological processes of both the senders and receivers of them. Understanding how narratives inform neurobiological processes is critical if we are to ascertain what effect narratives have on the psychology and neurobiology of human choices and behaviors, and can assist in everything ranging from exploring how Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is influenced by event repetition to better understanding the thoughts and feelings of others.</p>

<RESPDATE>040511
<CONTACT>Genevieve Colvin, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-283-4352, Fax 202-283-1534, Email Genevieve.Colvin@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service, National Office of Procurement, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bloomberg Financial L.P., 731 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10022 for two (2) Bloomberg Professional Service subscriptions.  The period of performance will be base and four (4) option years each. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

Bloomberg Professional is a subscription to access Bloombergs repository of financial data on its internet site. Pursuant to the subscription, Bloomberg Professional provides access to real time and historical market data for Equities, Futures, Options, Fixed Income and Currency Markets, historical dividend information, over the counter pricing from leading brokers, pricing data for oil and gas markets, financial data about foreign corporations and foreign stock prices, calculators to help price commodity swaps and options, credit default swap fundamentals and pricing, forward curve analytics, tools for calculating yield, spread, option-adjusted spread and total return, global foreign currency news, and other financial data and tools.

The Bloomberg Professional service is access to an online data suppository; therefore, deliverables include data queries including stock and bond issuance and pricing details, derivative values, derivative pricing models, foreign currency rates, market prices for securities traded outside of U.S. markets, and a mechanism to download financial data into Excel.

Bloomberg is the financial service used by many of our taxpayers and is the most comprehensive financial service available. Bloomberg is the only service that will provide access to a full range of global financial data. Such data is crucial to Financial Product (FP) Specialists in the examination of complex financial product transactions. 

Access to Bloombergs global suite of global financial data and pricing tools will assist FP Specialists to check taxpayers pricing of sophisticated financial instruments and to target areas of compliance risk. Further, because many of the larger taxpayers FP Specialists examine price their financial products based on data in Bloomberg, FP Specialists need access to the same data upon which taxpayers may have relied. A sole source is intended for this order; no other source is known that is fully capable and available to provide the required services.

Interested respondents shall demonstrate the capability to provide the same level of service, including user training, in a manner as cost effective as procuring services with Bloomberg. IRS will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 5 days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement (i.e. software costs, training for employees, contingencies, and professional environment). A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available.

If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that it is more advantageous to the Government, the IRS intends to negotiate a sole-source award to Bloomberg Financial L.P.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intended period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from the date of award, plus four (4) option years.

<DESC>Special Notice
<p>Classification Code: S - Utilities and Housekeeping Services<br />NAICS Code: 561720</p>
<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE to communicate TSA's intent to award a firm fixed price contract to Ka Lima O Maui, 95 Mahalani Street, Wailuku, HI 96793 on a sole source basis, for the purchase of janitorial services at checkpoint and baggage space at the Kahului International Airport (OGG). The period of performance will be a total of one (1) year.</p>
<p>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice. This contract is being awarded to a Nonprofit Agency serving people with other severe disabilities (AbilityOne).</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration was created in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. The Office of Field Real Estate Services (OFRES) is responsible for all TSA real estate space occupied by the TSA on and off airport. TSA currently occupies 11,603 square feet of checkpoint and baggage space at OGG. TSA space must be located on airport property for TSA to effectively carry out its mission. Airport space must be cleaned on a daily basis due to heavy passenger traffic.</p>
<p>An effort was made in 2010 to solicit potential sources for this requirement; however, sources on Maui were limited and there was little interest in the requirement. The TSA sought out other avenues to obtain services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration intends to negotiate with only one source; no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. Therefore, proposals will not be accepted directly on this requirement.</p>
<p>This contract will be negotiated with Ka Lima O Maui and ultimately awarded without further notice.</p>

<p>This is a brand name requirement. The IBM AIX Box, 740 Server with a 3 year warranty has been determined to be the only compatible source to maintain a consistent environment across the release process.</p>
<p>See Attachment #1 schedule of supplies and services for CLIN identification.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a firm fixed unit price for each CLIN and the total amount inclusive of shipping cost FOB destination. Delivery is required 30 days after receipt of order to DLA Information Operations at Ogden, 5851 F. Ave. Bldg. 849 Room A70, HAFB, UT 984056, Attn: Denise Sagel.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50 effective 16 March 2011, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Change Notice DPN 20110317 effective 17 March 2011, and Defense Logistics Agency Directive (DLAD) current to revision 5 and PROCLTR 2010-40. The complete text of the clauses and provisions in this notice may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated for purposes of this notice and will be included in the contract award document by either reference or full text:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (d) products samples, (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items; Evaluation for award shall be in accordance with FAR 13.106. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this notice on an all or none basis to the responsible offeror whose offer is the lowest price who can meet the delivery requirements for this brand name procurement.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. Addenda to 52.212-4; the following clauses apply:<br />The following clause is herby referenced by full text:<br />FAR 52.211-9 - Desired and Required Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 1 21<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />0001 1 30<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p><br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)<br />DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protest (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated by reference:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders-Commercial Items (in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply:</p>
<p>FAR 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government<br />FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor<br />FAR 52.222-19 Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies<br />FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of segregated facilities<br />FAR 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity<br />FAR 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans<br />FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities<br />FAR 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans<br />FAR 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases<br />FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer- Central Contractor Registration<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination</p>
<p>DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items. The following additional clauses/provisions apply:</p>
<p>FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities<br />DFARS 252.225-7012 Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities<br />DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports<br />DFARS 252.243-7002 Request for Equitable Adjustment<br />DLAD 52.247-901 Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material (WPM).</p>

DOE will only accept proposals from small businesses that do not exceed the small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts under NAICS code 484230 "Specialized Freight (except used goods) Trucking, Long-Distance."

<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />NIST has been tasked with testing the source code of applications that will be deployed on hand-held devices in various military theaters (e.g., Afghanistan). Given the sensitive nature of these applications, their target environment, and the data that they use, one of the goals of testing is to eliminate as many possible security weaknesses that might exist in the application's source code in order to reduce the risk of compromising sensitive information (which may, in turn, impact national security). The specification that identifies security weaknesses in software is referred to as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) (see http://cwe.mitre.org/). This specification specifies all known CWEs as well as the top 25 most dangerous CWEs (see https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/2010+CWE+SANS+Top+25+Most+Dangerous+Programming+Errors). One of the goals of this project is to test the software source code of these applications for as many of the top 25 most dangerous CWEs as possible. <br />To identify which product (open source or commercial) would provide the best top 25 CWE coverage (i.e., can detect the presence of more top 25 CWEs than any other product), NIST conducted a survey of all known open source and commercial testing products. Of these, NIST then identified those that detected any of the top 25 CWEs and found that Fortify provided the best coverage for identifying the top 25 CWEs; Fortify detects 23 of the top 25 CWEs while the next best product detects only 10 of the top 25 CWEs. Fortify is the only product that meets NIST's requirement because it detects a significantly amount more, 23 of the top 25 CWEs than any other known commercial product in its class which is required and critical for facilitating maximum security of applications in this sensitive environment. <br />All responsible offerors that are small businesses and Fortify-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

External storage unit shall be of an appropriate size for the facility, meet all codes set forth by the NFPA, OSHA, and other agencies, and shall be provided at no cost to VABHS.  It shall also contain proper ventilation, and waterproof lighting and power receptacles.   External storage unit shall be removed by the Contractor at completion of this contract at the Contractor's expense.  The Contractor shall coordinate with the VABHS and succeeding contractor to ensure no lapse in containment of containers.
3.	For each year of this contract, VABHS may request up to fifteen (15) additional containers per main campus and up to five (5) additional containers per CBOC at no additional cost to VABHS. The charge for additional containers beyond fifteen/five will be billed under a separate line item on current obligation.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>
<p>(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>
<p>(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.</p>
<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1)__Are,__are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3)__Are,__are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1)__In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2)__Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror__does__does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror__does__does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data to be accessed, and the type of information technology (IT) system access required. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause. The contractor shall: - Ensure that all non-U.S. citizen contractor employees are lawful permanent residents of the United States or have appropriate work authorization documents as required by the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Appeals, to work in the United States. - Ensure that no employees are assigned to High Risk designated positions prior to a completed preliminary screening. - Submit all required personnel security forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 24 hours of an assignment to a Department contract and ensure that the forms are complete. - Ensure that no contractor employee is placed in a higher risk position than that for which he or she was previously approved, without the approval of the Contracting Officer or his or her representative, the Department Personnel Security Officer, and the Computer Security Officer. - Ensure that all contractor employees occupying High Risk designated positions submit forms for reinvestigation every five (5) years for the duration of the contract or if there is a break in service to a Department contract of 365 days or more. - Report to the COR all instances of individuals seeking to obtain unauthorized access to any departmental IT system, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information. - Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment or access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information, promotes the efficiency of the service or violates the public trust. - Withdraw from consideration under the contract any employee receiving an unfavorable adjudication determination. - Officially notify each contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on a Department contract. - Abide by the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, "Contractor Employee Personnel Screenings."

<p>307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)<br />(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E).

In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest). <br />Offeror's Name ___________________________________________________ <br />RFP/Contract No. _________________________________________________ <br />Signature ________________________________________________________ <br />Title ____________________________________________________________ <br />Date ____________________________________________________________ <br /><br /><br />310-16 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)<br />The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract.

<p>314-1 PAST PERFORMANCE REPORT (MAR 1996)<br />Each offeror shall submit the following information as a separately bound part of its proposal for both the offeror and proposed major subcontractors. Major, regarding past performance, is any subcontractor that is subcontracted for a minimum of 25% of the total contract amount. Each major subcontractor shall identify the name of the prime contractor on each of its past performance forms. If the offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. <br />A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. If the offeror's last four similar contracts are all currently in process, submit the last three similar contracts currently in process, and the most recent similar contract completed within the last three years. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. Contracts with the parent or an affiliate of the offeror may not be used. Include the following information for each contract and subcontract: 1. Identification a. Name of the contracting activity b. Program title or product name c. Contract number d. Contract type e. Period of performance, including all option periods f. Contract Value: (1) Initial projected total contract amount including all option periods (2) Final or current projected total contract amount including all option periods g. Points of Contact (1) Contracting officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (2) Administrative contracting officer, if different from above, and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (3) Program manager, COTR or technical officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) 2.

Brief, specific examples of the offeror's high quality performance 3. If any of the listed contracts are award-fee or incentive contracts, include a table showing fees awarded and the minimum and maximum available fee for each period. 4. Paragraph E. below requires you to send a copy of the "Contractor Information Form" to each of your references. In your past performance report, include: a. The date you sent the "Contractor Information Form" to each reference. b. How you sent it (e.g., fax, mail, express delivery service, courier, e-mail, etc.). c. To whom you sent it including telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known). <br />B. The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in A above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Other than the information requested in A above, offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references. <br />C. Offerors should understand the difference between experience and past performance. Experience reflects the offeror's capability of performing a requirement. Past performance reflects how well it has performed similar requirements. In assessing past performance, the quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. <br />D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications(e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify which segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Information about awards will be considered in evaluation of each of the past performance subfactors described in "Evaluation Criteria." The offeror may describe how the award relates to one or more of the subfactors. <br />E. No later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation, send a copy to each of your four references of the "Contractor Performance Information" form attached to this solicitation. Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. <br />F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Past Performance" form identified in Attachment D will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br />311-6 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (APRIL 1998)<br />Offerors must submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist. Questions may be submitted via E-Mail, fax or regular mail to: Jessalyn Mastrianni, Jessalyn.Mastrianni@ed.gov and a concurrent copy to Desandre.Woodard@ed.gov.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Further, this controller should be able to provide some items to all in common or unison (floor maps of the building, for example, but with different "you are here" points at the different kiosk displays).  In other words, a controller that could add pictures, movies, audio, and streaming banners to each kiosk independently, or to all of them, quickly, if the need arises (emergency announcements, closures, etc).

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with GE Aviation Systems Limited, for the procurement of a maximum quantity of 114 V-22 Optical Blade Tracker Assemblies, part number 53100101. The anticipated contract will be a 5-year contract for 106 units in the base year and an option to procure two (2) additional units per year for four (4) years. These assemblies will be used at the Organizational Level of Maintenance to automatically measure the track of each proprotor blade on the V-22 aircraft, record vibrations, track data, and identify the required adjustments.&nbsp; The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not possess the drawings or technical data for the Optical Blade Tracker Assembly to permit full and open competition. GE Aviation, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of this Assembly owns the technical data and engineering drawings and all rights to this information. They are unwilling to sell this information or any data rights to the Government. Without that information, the Government is unable to organically design or solicit an Optical Blade Tracker Assembly with the proper interfaces that are required to ensure compatibility between the Assembly and the OBT end product. The Government intends to purchase these assemblies directly from the OEM. This is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The point of contact is Ms. Shannan Germond, shannan.germond@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research to determine the availability of firms for a potential competitive procurement. No award will be made from this Sources Sought. No solicitation, specifications, or drawings are available at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. Potential offerors having the skill, capabilities, and personnel necessary to perform the described ILMS services are invited to provide feedback via e-mail to Jonea Brown, Tom Sherman, or Vince Biller at jonea.m.brown@census.gov, thomas.m.sherman@census, or vincent.j.biller.iii@census.gov. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.<br /><br />Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential business sources for ILMS services at the U.S. Census Bureau, National Processing Center, (NPC), in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
<p>The NAICS INDUSTRY Code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and the size standard is $25 million (average annual receipts for preceding three fiscal years), and the Federal Service Code (FSC) is D317, Auto News, Data and Other Services.</p>
<p>The objective is to select and employ an ILMS using the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) model to deliver capabilities now missing from Census logistics activities. The Software-as-a-Service model in a Public Cloud Computing environment will assure lowest fixed cost and the economical scalability needed to best serve Census Bureau needs.<br /><br />SCOPE: The ILMS and associated vendor capabilities must be flexible enough to support a wide range of scope &amp; size in the number of users and transaction activity. The decennial census, performed every 10 years, is a 2-3 year long effort, when Bureau headcount rises by 750,000 plus and 500 field offices around the Continental US, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico are opened. It has been called the World's largest non-military undertaking. <br /><br />During the other 7-8 years, activities are similar, but smaller in scope &amp; scale.<br /><br />ANNUAL AVERAGE<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years 1-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years 8-10<br />Inventory Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,860&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 380,480<br />Outbound Shipments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67,369<br />In house Printing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38.8 Million&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 149.1 Million<br />Mail Pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.1 Million&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 46.6 Million<br />&nbsp;Kits* Built&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 Million<br /><br />* Kits are one or more cartons (avg. 18x6 3/4x13") containing an average of 20 line items in one or multiple quantities. There were over 700 variations during the last decennial.<br /><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Users will include personnel at 500+ field offices throughout the US and Puerto Rico. Large user population concentrations are at Bureau HQ in Suitland, MD and the National Processing Center at Jeffersonville, IN. Selected vendors, as well as quality personnel deployed at print vendor facilities, may provide direct inputs to the ILMS. Many decennial census users are temporary employees, so minimal training and ease of use are critical.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES: This section covers customer/user need and service imperatives.<br /><br />&bull; Phased implementation of a system to integrate planning and execution of Census Bureau logistics activity for decennial and all other censuses/surveys, including cross-functional visibility of activities/schedule completion.<br />&bull; Initial phase to include requirements for acquisition, inventory/order management and shipment consolidation.<br />&bull; Then process planning, scheduling and tracking, including vendor or in house print &amp; finishing operations.<br />&bull; Final capability provides complete material acquisition status from request through delivery (this information to be obtained from other systems or direct input by users).<br />&bull; Reduce number of steps and navigation required to perform routine inventory transactions.<br />&bull; Allow tailoring of screen layouts and reports at user level.<br />&bull; Control user access and manage restricted read/write authorization.<br />&bull; Planning/scheduling applications must readily interface with MS Project or other Bureau scheduling applications.<br />&bull; Provide materials catalog for online orders, with item image and description, plus ordering constraints.<br />&bull; Strong deadline/suspense capability/accountability to highlight delays in completing scheduled activity at any level; so all system users are informed and can assess potential impact by quickly identifying gaps and issues.<br />&bull; Internal messaging, so users can communicate direct on logistics matters or push messages to outside e mail or other tools.<br />&bull; Provide simplified user printer set-up.<br />&bull; Integral support for bar code data capture/input.<br />&bull; Incorporate data validation techniques, such as character sieves and field edits to ensure only valid data are entered. Provide associated control and auditing.<br />&bull; Collaboration tools to enhance cross-functional and parent-child interaction and permit highlighting priority tasks.<br />&bull; Strong scheduling tools at every level to compliment program and project master schedules, while permitting early identification of resource constraints and labor planning.<br />&bull; Easy item look-up.<br />&bull; Auto-generate Bills of Material from product/kit definition.<br />&bull; MRP II features and functionality, including demand planning, plus finite capacity scheduling and lean practices or other process analysis &amp; control approaches for optimal performance and productivity.<br />&bull; Inventory and warehouse management at central, regional &amp; local office levels; 5-600 separate inventories that roll up <br />&bull; Drill down capability to move directly from top level to detailed information.<br />&bull; Support standardized item description and stock numbering (Item master).<br />&bull; Separate Web testing, training and development site.<br />&bull; Strong Job Tracking features, including automation &amp; PLC interfaces, downtime reporting and schedule compliance.<br />&bull; Business Rules functionality for process control and improved productivity by sharing guidance among all system users, while ensuring consistency across functional areas.<br />&bull; HR, full Finance/Accounting and CRM are not required initially.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor, First Coast Service Options, Inc., under the current contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0008Z in the amount of $41,885 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment).</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA4814-11-R-0009
<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Dominion Federal (a small business). The vendor shall provide monthly lease and maintenance of permanent office facilities at United States Central Command (CENTCOM), Coalition-Joint Task Force (C-JTF), using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A)&amp;(B). "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".
<p>Dominion Federal is the only responsible source. This action is required to retain and maintain existing critical/mission essential work space that was constructed to directly support the Iraq War effort beginning in 2006. Because those efforts have now been re-directed to support troops in the continuing war against terrorism in Afghanistan, this facility is required for an additional unknown period of time. This 78,000 square foot modular office complex was constructed and configured to the specialized needs of the end-user. Costs are not expected to be recouped through re-competion of this requirement. Therefore, negotiations with the owner of the modular units which make up this mission critical complex/facility is in the best interest of the Government. The period of performance for this contract will include a base year and four option years.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted using various methods to include: Internet searches and telephone inquiries. No vendor expressed interest in participating in the requirement. The Government intends to award a contract to vendor specified above. The North American Industry Classification System is 531120 and the size standard is $7 million. "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to a previous notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The 6th Contracting Squadron will post this notice until 1:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 11 April 2011 and intends to award a contract after expiration of this notice. Note: No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. <br />Dominion Federal owns the modular facilities to be leased. Award to any other contractor would result in the Government incurring costs for installation of another company's modular building to include: removing and reinstalling secure and unsecure communication equipment and infrastructure, site preparation, electric, water, sewer, and storm drainage, and modular furniture. These costs are not expected to be recouped though a competitive acquisition, especially since another contractor would experience investment and start-up costs already borne by the government for the current modular facility, i.e., the government would be paying these costs twice. In addition, awarding a contract to another contractor would require temporary suspension of the 24-hour C-JTF operation. There are no existing facilities on MacDill AFB to accommodate C-JTF forces during the removal of the modular facilities. Due to the on-going war effort, USCENTCOM cannot bear disruption in its mission for any period of time. Additionally, the lay-out of the current facility accommodates secure mission workload and discretely partitions members from more than 60 Coalition nations allowing them to independently contribute to the war effort for their respective nations. There are no other sites on MacDill AFB that can accommodate this operation on a temporary or permanent basis. <br />USCENTCOM considered building a permanent facility for the collation forces but determined the real property portion of such an acquisition would not be feasible. As such, the project would be a Military Construction (MILCON) project and funding would require Congressional approval, taking up to 3 years to appropriate. Currently, no appropriation has been set-aside for this project because the Coalition is a Joint Task Force, which by design is a temporary force. DOD has no plans to permanently base the C-JTF. Further, the 6 AMW has no need or authorization for the type of permanent facility the C-JTF uses. Finally, the annual maintenance, repair and operation cost for a MILCON facility project would far exceed a 50-year life expectancy for that type of facility. These costs, coupled with the costs the government has already paid to lease the current modular buildings, means a permanent facility would be much more expensive than continuing to lease the existing buildings.</p>
<p>Finally, CENTCOM considered leasing off-base commercial space. Market research and information obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Facility Office revealed the cost would be too great to lease a commercial facility. CENTCOM estimates there would additional costs for infrastructure, security, maintenance, communications, furniture, equipment, and other direct costs if a lease were pursued. These costs don't include the cost of moving personnel and equipment, disrupting the operations/loss of mission capability all of which will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the CENTCOM's requirements as mentioned earlier in the J&amp;A. Also, the COE could take 6-8 months (or longer) to find a suitable location and negotiate the lease which will exceed the time remaining on the current contract. Additionally, from a security standpoint, an off-base lease is the least viable option because the personnel occupying the space are foreign nationals conducting very sensitive intelligence-related work and their US counterparts are located on MacDill AFB. Finally, this option is the least flexible contractually because the Government would have to enter a long-term agreement for the commercial space and may have to pay significant termination costs if the C-JTF operation ceases. On the other hand, by continuing to lease the current modular buildings, the government could end the lease by not exercising the next option year.</p>

<DESC>The Government is interested in further investigation into a Non-Thermal Treatment Process for ammunition related items that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies as exempt from consideration as an incinerator. This treatment process is targeted toward recovering valuable metallic components and other higher value residuals.  Classification as non-incineration can lessen the cost and complexity of implementation of such a capability at a commercial/organic demilitarized facility,  which will result in a cost effective approach to demilitarize select conventional and missile related ammunition items.   This is due, in part, to the lower cost of environmental permitting and subsequent cost per ton for operations.   Such a process should also allow for greater flexibility and more timely response to changing demilitarized requirements.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 
DUE TO SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT

1.  REQUIRING ACTIVITY:  Office of Information Technology

2.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  Atlanta VA Regional Office

3.  PROPOSED ACTION:  Sole source procurement of office relocation and facility services (temporary office space) for the VETSNET contractor group.

4.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  The Office of Information Technology requires relocation and facility services, including turnkey office space, conference room space, and VA-compliant IT infrastructure, for 38 contractors. The time frame during which these services will be required for 38 contractors, is from April 1, 2011, through September 30, 2011, with three one-month options to extend occupancy for any or all of the offices under contract. There is also an additional requirement for the same services for 8 contractors after the conclusion of the base year contract, to continue occupancy through Febuary 11, 2012.

5.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  FAR 6.302-1 

6.  NATURE OF ACQUISITION TO MEET THE AUTHORITY CITED IN PARAGRAPH 5:   
The Office of Information Technology is strongly recommending sole source procurement of the required services via contract with Regus PLC. The VETSNET contractor group is currently occupying short-term space in a Tampa Regus facility with point-to-point T-1 service already installed under VA contract. Remaining at this same facility in the offices currently occupied is essential for continuity of this VA network service. Relocation to another facility would entail moving this service, with an expected leadtime for such a move order being not less than two months.

Of the sources that might be available for this requirement, the Regus organization has especially demonstrated the ability to work with VA OI&T to provide physical network infrastructure and connectivity which meets VA network reliability and security standards. These are critical requirements when VA employees are operating in a multi-tenant environment, where network integrity and security are prominent issues. Because the time-sensitive nature of the requirement does not allow time for the move of T-1 service or careful vetting of the IT performance of other sources, VBA Facilities is requesting that this contract be awarded sole source to Regus PLC without further competition.

7.  DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONDUCT ANY MARKET RESEARCH TO LOCATE SOURCES:  
N/A. 

8.  CUSTOMER'S SUBMISSION OF PRICE ANALYSIS: 
The quote received for this scope of service is considered fair and reasonable based on historical costs incurred for this type service.

9.  ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SUPPORT OF SUBMISSION: 
N/A

10.	LISTING OF ANY SOURCES (IF ANY) THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT   
N/A

11.  FUTURE ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIER TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:    
N/A 
12.  This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my belief and knowledge.

<DESC><p>This Brand Name Justification is published for information only.&nbsp; This requirement is being competed under GSA E-Buy.<br /><br /><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S STATEMENT REGARDING<br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>Oracle License Technical Upgrades and Maintenance</p>
<p><br />1. Identification of Agency and the Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>US Forest Service, WO-CIO</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification approval is hereby requested for annual maintenance and technical upgrades for existing, perpetual Oracle software licenses required to support the FS information technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need Including Estimated the Value:</p>
<p>a. The contractor shall provide the government technical upgrades and maintenance of the software licenses identified in Attachment A - USDA FS Licenses - Oracle dated 18 January 2011.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall provide Oracle Premier Support, as follows:<br />&bull; Major product and technology releases<br />&bull; Technical support<br />&bull; My Oracle Support<br />&bull; Updates, fixes, security alerts, data fixes, and critical patch updates<br />&bull; Tax, legal, and regulatory updates<br />&bull; Upgrade scripts<br />&bull; Certification with most new third-party products/versions<br />&bull; Certification with most new Oracle products</p>
<p>4. Identification of the Justification Rationale (see 8.405-6(a) and (b)) and, if applicable, demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply and service:</p>
<p>Oracle is a leading supplier of database software products on the market in the United States. The procurement of perpetual Oracle software licenses and associated support for Information Technology solutions has been an ongoing relationship since the FS Server architecture migrated from a main frame to a distributed IP architecture as part of Project-615. As a result of this corporate decision, the Agency invested in perpetual and periodically renewable software licenses from Oracle and implemented the software across the IT infrastructure. This procurement provides for maintenance and support of both types of licenses as well as the renewal of non- perpetual licenses. Procuring Oracle brand name support for Oracle licenses offers the following advantages to the agency:</p>
<p>a) Leverage existing investment: The agency has already invested in the purchase of the perpetual Oracle licenses identified in Attachment A. In order to effectively use the perpetual licenses in the FS environment, the FS has an ongoing need to upgrade the licenses and obtain Oracle support of said licenses when necessary. By procuring the maintenance and technical upgrades to existing licenses owned by the FS, the FS can effectively leverage the existing software investment in which the information technology environment and infrastructure is built around</p>
<p>b) Reduce integration costs and time to market: FS support technicians will be able to use familiar programming software for initial installation and updates. This is critical to maintain continuity of services in existence today.</p>
<p>c) Reduce support costs: Agency technicians have had extensive agency/vendor training to support Oracle software.</p>
<p>d) Provide priority service: Due to the long-standing relationship with Oracle, the agency would be provided priority service with a dedicated account manager working through the prime contractor to support FS purchases and provide support.</p>
<p>e) Other product specific advantages: This product allows the FS to take advantage of our extensive work force that is trained to support Oracle software and its integration into the agency's infrastructure.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d):</p>
<p>Competition under the GSA Schedule will be used to procure the Oracle technical support and upgrades.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Market Research Conducted Among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and a determination was made that Oracle technical and maintenance support can be procured direct from Oracle or through authorized Oracle resellers. On 03 March 2011 the CO made a check of contractors with GSA contracts who could supply Oracle products to update the previous market research performed by the program manager. Nineteen (19) contractors were found; 15 SB and 11 LB. Of those 11 SB and 3 LB contractors had the two (2) SIN codes required for this effort. On this basis, the CO determined that full and open competition offered the best opportunity to maximize competition and assure the Forest Service of being able to acquire the needed Oracle support.</p>
<p>7. Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>8. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers That Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made:</p>
<p>The Oracle maintenance and technical support order will be written for a base and four (4) option periods. At that time, the market can be reevaluated to determine whether or not there is another source for the Oracle maintenance and technical support.</p>
<p>9. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>GS-P-06-11-TK-0014
<DESC>This justification is for a procurement between the General Services Administration, St. Louis West Field Office (6PFW), 9700 Page Boulevard and 4300 Goodfellow, St. Louis, MO and BHS, Operations and Maintenance Contract GS06P02GXC0066 at 4300 Goodfellow, Saint Louis, MO. This delivery order was for sole source emergency repairs to Boiler # 4 and Boiler #5 which provide heating to Building 103 at 4300 Goodfellow issued 3/11/11 via a written delivery order. Boilers #4 and #5 are the sole boilers serving all of Building 103 and therefore critical to run during the heating months for building protection and tenant owned equipment protection that cannot afford downtime due to mission requirements.
<p>During the course of repairs on Boiler #4 the contractor discovered cracks in the front section and in the rear section of Boiler #4 that would require additional repairs so that the unit could be placed back on line. In addition, a new leak developed on Boiler #5 while work was still in progress with Boiler #4. As it was a sensitive time frame with backup boiler #4 down, the situation became more critical as the operating Boiler #5 with the leak had the potential to completely malfunction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, performing the additional repairs on Boiler #5 would allow for cost savings while the work was in progress and a crane was already on site for work on Boiler #4. A reprocurement for repairs in boiler #4 would have also been more costly to the government with Boiler # 4 already torn apart and repairs too far in progress to stop and bring in another vendor. Therefore, in order to finish emergency repairs on Boiler #4 and Boiler #5, a purchase order was issued in the amount of $9,764.64. These additional repairs for the two units required further justification due to the dollar amounts involved; although the type of work is in the scope of the BHS contract.</p>

<DESC>DETERMINATION OF LIMITATION OF SOURCES 

VA Pacific Island Health Care System
459 Patterson Road
Honolulu, HI 96819

1.   Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Contracting Activity-VISN 21.

2.   Description of Action: This action limits competition for the acquisition of renting outdoor hotel spaces of the Hale Koa Hotel in Honolulu to provide recreation activities in conjunction with the National Veterans Golden Age Games (NVGAG) to be conducted from May 25 to Jun 1, 2011 for VA Pacific Island Health Care System (VAPIHCS).

3.   Description of Services/Supplies: A request for services was placed by Karl Hall, Associate Director of Honolulu VAMC on 4 Feb 2011. The Honolulu VAMC is identified as the host of the 2011 NVGAG from May 24 to Jun 1, 2011. During this period the host is planning numerous outdoor functions and activities for the NVGAG participants to be conducted at the only viable, large open space, adjacent to the contracted hotel facility that can accommodate wheelchair bound participants. The contracted hotel, Hawaiian Village, is unable to accommodate over 1,000 participants in an open space environment, whereas, the Hale Koa Hotel is ideal and secured.  

The value is $63,100.00 for renting the outdoor grounds from May 25 to Jun 1, 2011.

4.   Authority Cited:  FAR.13.601(b)(1) Only one source is reasonably available because the Hale Koa hotel is ideally located next to the contracted hotel and have outdoor recreation space that can accommodate approximately 1,000 users.  The ideal location has wheelchair access to the grounds and will be used for numerous NVGAG events such as shot put and discus throwing.  No other location will meet the Government's needs for outdoor space that is adjacent to the contracted hotel.   
	
5.   Reason for Authority Cited: The authority cited in paragraph 4 must be used because of the bona fide Government requirement that necessitated this commitment via 2237 459-11-2-3371-0024. Customer comments associated with this purchase order "There is no other field or other open area for rent in Waikiki that could accommodate this group.  This site is located next door to the host hotel and the veterans are elderly and some are physically challenged; using wheelchairs need the site to be accessible to where they are lodged." 

6.  Efforts Made for Soliciting from Other Vendors:   

a. This requirement will not be synopsized in accordance with 5.202(a)(2), in that this acquisition is being conducted under unusual and compelling urgency and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203.     
	
b. This requirement does not allow for competition due to services rendered.
 
7.   Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated price will be determined to be fair and reasonable.  A Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) will detail how the Government has determined that the anticipated costs will be fair and reasonable.  As this service has been determined to be commercial, cost or pricing data will not be required. Pricing techniques such as are described in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2), will be used to establish price fairness and reasonableness.

8.   Market Research: Because of the urgency of this action, market research was not conducted. 

9.   Supporting Facts:  

Any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or requirements or other rationale for limited sources) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.  The evidence for this is the "Technical Data to Support a Restricted Competition" in the contract file.

The NVGAG is the premier senior adaptive rehabilitation program in the United States, and is the only national multi-event sports and recreational seniors' competition program designed to improve the quality of life for all older veterans, including those with a wide range of abilities and disabilities.  The Games serve as qualifying event for competition in the National Senior Games in a number of competitive events.  Military veterans ages 55 and older who receive health care at any VA medical facility are eligible to compete in the National Veterans Golden Age Games.  

The Hale Koa hotel site has the most suitable open outdoor space that is accessible for wheelchair bound participants, large enough to host over 1,000 people to attend day and evening events, and suitable to conduct numerous NVGAG athletic events, recreational and rehabilitative events (i.e. shot put, discus throwing, Opening Ceremony) and competitions (Horse shoes and Adaptive Track and Field Events).  The Hale Koa grounds provide ample space for all participants and spectators.  The Hale Koa, which is less than 100 yards from the contracted hotel, is the only hotel suitable to meet the Government's needs.  

10.  Listing of Sources: Hale Koa Hotel, 2055 Kalia Road, Honolulu, HI 96815, 808-955-0555.
  
11.  Statement of Actions:    

This is a statement of actions to avoid unauthorized commitments for emergency services.  Because this type of event is considered a "one-time" only event, it is imperative that all parties concerned are involved in the early stages of planning to preclude the use of "urgent and compelling" procurements.  

a. Notify the Director of NVGAG that when planning to host an event of this nature to ensure all requirements are planned prior to securing the contracted hotel.  

b. Notify the Host of the event to perform market research to determine if there are suitable hotels and outdoor spaces available to host such an enormous event for the NVGAG veterans with special needs.  

c. Notify the Transportation Coordinator to be part of the planning stages to ensure suitable hotels and adjacent outdoor facilities are suitable for the NVGAG.

12.  Contracting Officer Certification:  
I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
