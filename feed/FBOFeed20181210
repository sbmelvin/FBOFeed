<DESC>SYNOPSIS 
GT-Suite Annual Software Maintenance
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase annual software maintenance for Gamma Technologies GT-Suite. The OAR NVFEL SACO anticipates awarding a single firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to Gamma Technologies. EPA has identified Gamma Technologies as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this acquisition. 

The EPA Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) requires continued use of Gamma Technologies software to support our advanced vehicle simulation and modeling work.  GT-Suite is a trademarked programming and modeling computer software program already utilized by ASD engineers, which has supported the design and implementation of complete engine combustion systems for full vehicle modeling systems.  GT-Suite’s unique features allow engineers performing this work to graph and tab representations, including state transition diagrams, flow charts, state transition tables, and truth tables, in order to model real time and offline complete combustion systems.  Specific software functionalities required are:

•	Modeling environment, graphical components, and simulation for full vehicle and HIL systems
•	Complete combustion simulation systems
•	State diagrams, state transition tables, and state transition matrices representing finite state machines
•	Flow charts, functions, and truth tables for representing algorithms
•	State diagram animation, state activity logging, data logging, and integrated debugging for analyzing the design and detecting run-time errors
•	Static and run-time checks for transition conflicts, cyclic problems, state inconsistencies, data-range violations, and overflow conditions

This procurement will be accomplished under commercial item procedures FAR Part 12. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSERTION (CFDA) Number: 12.800 and 12.910</p>
<p><strong>I. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, design, development, integration, test, evaluation and experimentation of innovative technologies and techniques for timely, secure, and mission-responsive aerial warfighting network capabilities.</p>
<p>The BAA is focused on the innovation, development, and maturation of secure communications, networking, and information management technologies. Commanders must be able to command and control lines of communication in today's information dominated environment. The network is the "critical tool" to accomplish the mission. The network brings together platforms, sensors &amp; shooters at the Commander's disposal to dynamically task and rapidly deploy in response to threats and mission needs as they evolve. A timely, secure, and mission-responsive network is critical to the translation of sensory data into actionable information and for assuring tailored communications globally, from the (permissive) C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) enterprise to the (highly contested) tactical edge. To build future AF network capabilities that can respond to the mission, operations tempo, and threat environment, the Government cannot rely solely on a data-neutral network. The future lies in affordable, extensible, interoperable communications architectures that intelligently distribute information in a robust way that enables shared situational awareness and timely decision-making, ultimately, to assure the mission.</p>
<p>White papers may describe but are not limited to</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	Hardware brass-boards and/or software systems development. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	Activities for validation with model-based system design and simulation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	Demonstration of hardware brass-boards and antenna in-the-loop validation techniques.</p>
<p>Research efforts under this BAA are expected to result in functional capabilities, concepts, theory, applications and demonstrations addressing Air Force aerial network connectivity problems. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Work is encouraged in, but not limited to, these focus areas:</p>
<p>1.0	Agile, Resilient, Affordable, and IP capable battlefield networking architecture integrating alternative Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Develop functional capabilities, concepts, theory and application using existing infrastructure to ensure backwards compatibility along with mature technology to support operations in Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and PNT denied or restricted environments to include Anti-Access, Area Denied (A2/AD) operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	This capability will be achieve by focusing on aircraft integration to ensure affordability and enhance flexibility in supporting changes in mission and technology.  Implementation will use military communication links.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	The proposed architecture will provide support for several Combatant Command (COCOM) missions in a SATCOM restricted or denied environment as well as accelerate the speed of decision to get inside the enemy's Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) loop.</p>
<p>2.0	Agile Communication Links &amp; Networks</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Develop reliable wideband connectivity capabilities to support: (i) agile wideband communications; (ii) affordable, secure, and robust multi-mission radio frequency (RF) functions; and (iii) advanced low probability of intercept (LPI), low probability of detection (LPD), and anti&#8208;jam (AJ) modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Push the state-of-the-art in military link capacity from single to tens of Gigabits per second to keep pace with the growing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suite output. Some of this wideband capability will be leveraged for servicing key nodes in the high capacity backbone envisaged by the Joint Aerial Layer Network (JALN).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	This work is comprised of both line of sight (LOS), to include hybrid RF and optical links, and beyond line of sight (BLOS) connectivity, to include satellite and over-the-horizon communications. Both LOS and BLOS communications must be exploited by an aerial network (AN) to provide a resilient information transport capability.</p>
<p>3.0	Tactical Network Security/Information Assurance</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Demonstrate ability to securely share multiple forms of information (e.g., voice, video, text, files) among networks of differing classifications and releasabilities. Information exchanges are secured through a combination of data inspection to prevent data spills and propagation of cyber-attacks, data canonicalization to simplify these data inspection techniques, and novel methods to attest the provenance of trusted data in an assured manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Develop a more agile and robust information management capability that spans security domains, allowing for more seamless sharing with our coalition partners. The secure data sharing capability develops technologies to enable both information sharing and data exchange across multiple security domains (e.g. JWICS, SIPRNET, NIPRNET, coalition networks) and also push the state-of-the-possible in object&#8208;level protection at a level commensurate with enforcing mandatory access controls on a single, multi&#8208;level network.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#61607;	Demonstrate a wide range of information exchange capabilities that are scalable, adaptable, secure, resilient, context-aware, federated and responsive to dynamic mission conditions and management policies. The technologies to support these capabilities include: mission-oriented architectures, Quality of Service policies, publish/subscribe/query mechanisms, semantic characterization, federation, machine learning, opportunistic resource scheduling, peer-to-peer protocols, and open system architectures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING</span>:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH</span></strong>.  It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189 defines fundamental research as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fundamental research' means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.</p>
<p>As of the date of publication of this BAA, the Government cannot identify whether work proposed under this BAA may be considered fundamental research and may award both fundamental and non-fundamental research.  Offerors should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While offerors should clearly explain the intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Appropriate clauses will be included in resultant awards for non-fundamental research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate.</p>
<p>For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the awardee is restricted research, a sub-awardee may be conducting fundamental research.  In those cases, it is the awardee's responsibility to explain in their proposal why its sub-awardee's effort is fundamental research.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLOUD COMPUTING</span></strong>.  In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.239-7010, if the development proposed requires storage of Government, or Government-related data on the cloud, offerors need to ensure that the cloud service provider proposed has been granted Provisional Authorization by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) at the level appropriate to the requirement.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP ONE</span> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government is only soliciting white papers at this time</span>.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL</strong>.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  See Section VI of this announcement for further details regarding the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>III. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION</span>:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1.  ELIGIBILITY:  All qualified offerors who meet the requirements of this BAA may apply.</p>
<p>2.  FOREIGN PARTICIPATION/ACCESS: <br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; a.<strong> This BAA is closed to foreign participation</strong>.  This includes both foreign ownership and foreign nationals as employees or subcontractors.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; b.	Exceptions.  <br /></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.	Fundamental Research.  If the work to be performed is unclassified, fundamental research, this must be clearly identified in the white paper and/or proposal.  See Part II, Section I for more details regarding Fundamental Research.  Offerors should still identify any performance by foreign nationals at any level (prime contractor or subcontractor) in their proposals.  Please specify the nationals' country of origin, the type of visa or work permit under which they are performing and an explanation of their anticipated level of involvement.  Offerors may be asked to provide additional information during negotiations in order to verify the foreign citizen's eligibility to participate on any contract or assistance agreement issued as a result of this announcement.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.	Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) companies who have mitigation plans/paperwork in place.  Proof of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">approved</span></strong> mitigation documentation must be provided to the contracting office focal point, Amber Buckley, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-3605, or e-mail Amber.Buckley@us.af.mil prior to submitting a white paper and/or a proposal.  For information on FOCI mitigation, contact the Defense Security Service.  Additional details can be found at: http://www.dss.mil/isp/foci/foci_mitigation.html</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.	Foreign Nationals as Employees or Subcontractors. <strong>Applicable to any effort not considered Fundamental Research</strong>.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all employees and/or subcontractors who will work on a resulting contract are eligible to do so.  Any employee who is not a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident will be restricted from working on any resultant contract unless prior approval of the Department of State or the Department of Commerce is obtained via a technical assistance agreement or an export license. Violations of these regulations can result in criminal or civil penalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; c.	Information Regarding Non-US Citizens Assigned to this Project</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.	Contractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology (IT) networks in connection with the work on contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA <strong>must be U.S. citizens</strong>.  For the purpose of base and network access, possession of a permanent resident card ("Green Card") does not equate to U.S. citizenship.  This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments.  It also does not apply to dual citizens who possess US citizenship, to include Naturalized citizens.  Any waivers to this requirement must be granted in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to providing access.  Specific format for waiver request will be provided upon request to the Contracting Officer.  The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.	For the purposes of Paragraph 1, if an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system.  If an IT network/system requires a U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system, AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications, consistent with the requirements above:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a)	Contractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b)	Contractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.</p>
<p>Any additional access restrictions established by the IT network/system owner apply.</p>
<p>3.  FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES:  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this BAA in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>&nbsp; a.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FFRDCs</span>:  FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector; and FFRDCs must provide a letter on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization citing the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and their compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement's terms and conditions.  This information is required for FFRDCs proposing to be prime contractors or sub-awardees.</p>
<p>&nbsp; b.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Entities</span>:  Government entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations.  While 10 U.S.C.&sect; 2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility.</p>
<p>FFRDC and Government entity eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the offeror.</p>
<p>Government agencies interested in performing work related to this announcement should contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  If resulting discussions reveal a mutual interest, cooperation may be pursued via other vehicles.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT-APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM:  An offeror must have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government-approved</span></strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.  The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).   <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span>:</strong> If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions:  https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_</p>
<p>cview=1</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; f. HUMAN USE: All research involving human subjects, to include the use of human biological specimens and human data, selected for funding must comply with Federal regulations for human subject protection.  Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, "Protection of Human Subjects" found at:  http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html,  and DoD Directive 3216.02, "Protection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research" found at:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.	Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.	All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must have a valid assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must document the completion of appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.	For all research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must submit evidence of a plan for review by an institutional review board (IRB) as part of the proposal. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution's Assurance of Compliance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. The designated IRB should be consulted for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with 32 CFR 219.116. A valid Assurance of Compliance and evidence of appropriate training by all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.	In addition to a local IRB approval, An AFRL-level human subject regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about the AFRL-level review process.  Confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance and appropriate human subjects protection training is required before AFRL-level approval can be issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.	The time required to complete the IRB review/approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants; ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. The IRB approval process can last between 1 to 3 months, followed by a DoD review that could last 3 to 6 months. No funding may be used toward human subject research until all approvals are granted.  Therefore, in their cost proposals offerors should separate human use into a separate option.</p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.	CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">listed in descending order of&nbsp;importance</span></strong> will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.	Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.	Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c.	Openness and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d.	Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used to select white papers for proposal invitation.  Proposals will be evaluated IAW this evaluation criteria only and categorized/selected for award as detailed in Section V.2.b.2.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.	Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.	<strong>WHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL REVIEW PROCESS:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.	<strong>FIRST STEP - White Paper Reviews:</strong> The Government will review White Papers to identify those with the greatest potential to best meet the Air Force's needs based on the criteria listed above.  If funding is available for an identified white paper, AFRL/RI will request a formal technical and cost proposal from offeror. For white papers not of interest to the Government, or for which funding is not available, those offerors will receive letters from the Government indicating the basis for non-selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.	<strong>SECOND STEP - Proposal Review and Selection Process</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) <strong>Categories</strong>: Based on the evaluation, proposals will be categorized as Selectable or Not Selectable (see definitions below). The selection of one or more offerors for award will be based on the evaluation, as well as importance to agency programs and funding availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. <strong>Selectable</strong>: Proposals are recommended for acceptance, if sufficient funding* is available.  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. <strong>Not Selectable</strong>: Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * <em>Selectable proposals will be designated as funded or unfunded.  Letters will be sent to the unfunded offerors. These proposals may be funded at a later date without reevaluation, if funding becomes available</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only a part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Selectable, though the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposals' technical, cost, and schedule risk will be assessed as part of the above evaluation criteria's application. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d) Prior to award of a potentially successful offer, the Contracting Officer will make a determination regarding price reasonableness and realism.</p>
<p>3.  FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS:  As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) over the period of performance.  An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered.  The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and FAR 9.104-6.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>

The Government encourages the best sources from the scientific and industrial communities to propose, including small businesses, large businesses, academia and non-profit entities.  Non-small business are encourage to team with small businesses to come up with the best technical solutions and obtain the best mix of cost, performance and schedule.</p>
<p>5.  DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.	SBIR RIGHTS.  The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized.  In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration.  Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>

<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.	The Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and noncommercial computer software (NCS) developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.</p>

Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the contracting officer.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.	 IDENTIFICATION &amp; ASSERTION.  IAW DFARS 252.227-7017, the Identification and assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restriction provision applies.  See AFRL/RI Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions for further guidance and samples.</p>
<p>6.  REPORTING:   <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Contract Applicable:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<SOLNBR>IFIB-ACO-KFOR-18-30
<RESPDATE>011019
<ARCHDATE>01162019

<DESC>Headquarters Kosovo Force (HQ KFOR) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the provision of specialized technical reconnaissance and surveillance services for KFOR HQ's Film City in Pristina Kosovo.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility within the United States, 2) be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), (3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government, and (4) have performed at least one contract within the last three years and with a minimum duration of six months substantially similar in scope, complexity and magnitude to the requirement described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>In addition, contractor personnel are required to hold an active security clearance at the level of NATO SECRET for the performance of this work.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-ACO-KFOR-18-30 and all correspondence regarding the IFIB should include that reference.</p>
<p>Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to obtain Specialized Technical Reconnaissance and Surveillance Services for HQ KFOR, Film City, Kosovo. The requirement is intended to provide situational awareness to the KFOR Command Group and manoeuver elements through day/night (EO/IR) video/imagery surveillance with real-time Full Motion Video (FMV) downlinked to the KFOR Joint Operations Center (JOC) and real-time FMV and imagery available for exploitation.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate potential U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidder list for this procurement, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. U.S. firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities">http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</a></p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for the project. The Department of Commerce uses a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms should request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 10 January 2019</p>
<p>NATO contracting office issues IFIB (planned): 17 January 2019</p>
<p>HQ KFOR will directly e-mail the IFIB to all firms on its bidders list.</p>
<p>Bid closing (planned): 19 March 2019</p>
<p>Period of Performance: One base year and four one-year options</p>

<DESC>Human physiology is a limiting factor in the operational readiness of the United States Department of Defense. When the human body is damaged or a physiological system is not functioning optimally, interventions are required to help mend the injury or support continued performance. DARPA seeks to develop new technological approaches in medicinal chemistry and systems pharmacology to expand the druggable proteome and discover new therapeutic tools in the areas of soft tissue pain/inflammation and metabolic stress that limit optimal physiological function.. This new platform technology will directly address needs within the Department of Defense to support the unique physiological demands of the warfighter and provide proof-of-concept for novel drug discovery and development pipelines.

<p>Statement of Need and Purpose:<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to produce of recombinant tubulin and tubulin modifying enzymes in the baculovirus expression system.</p>
<p>Background Information and Objective:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes, (NINDS) Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit (CBBU) conducts biophysical and structural studies on the microtubules and microtubule regulating proteins and the defects in this regulation in neurodegenerative disorders. The CBBU will continue to conduct its research using the series of baculovirus expression which have led to production of recombinant proteins required for the multiple ongoing research of tubulin and tubulin modification function in cells and in-vitro. The current projects require production and purification of engineered tubulin and proteins that serve as enzymes and substrates for the assays that the CBBU uses daily. Targeted proteins could not be obtained in bacterial expression system despite multiple approaches. The CBBU does not have high volume capacity and has time constrained capability to use any other expression system in house and therefore has contracted with the University of Colorado Cancer Center to Protein Production / MoAB / Tissue Culture Core.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Program Office (MPO) (PMA/PMW- 101) plans to increase the contract ceiling under the existing MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Multiple Award Contracts N00039-15-D-0007 with Data Link Solutions LLC (DLS) and N00039-15-D-0008 with ViaSat, Inc. (ViaSat) due to the requirement to procure and/or retrofit additional MIDS JTRS Concurrent Multi-Netting-4 (CMN-4), F-22 and Advanced Waveform terminals to meet current Link-16 platform user needs.  The MIDS JTRS technology contains Intellectual Property (IP), with Specially Negotiated License Rights between DLS and ViaSat only, which does not allow providing the technology to third parties. Only DLS and ViaSat can perform the effort without a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 334290.
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 3304(c)(1), and FAR 6.302(a)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice of intent to increase the ceiling of the current MIDS JTRS contracts N00039-15-D-0007 and N0039-15-D-0008 to allow for the additional MIDS JTRS efforts described above should be submitted no later than (15) calendar days from the date of this synopsis to Ms. Lindsay Nickel, Contracting Officer, at lindsay.nickel@navy.mil.

<p>Synthetic Cartilage Products:</p>
<p>P/N CAR-10-US, Cartiva MTP Implant, 10mm 1 <br />P/N CAR-08-US, Cartiva MTP Implant, 8mm 1 <br /><br />Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) has a requirement to purchase a synthetic cartilage implant for a surgical procedure scheduled for 11 December 2018 with Dr. A. Raja. Only one implant shall be used however, the surgeon cannot determine the actual implant size till the surgery. The Cartiva Synthetic Cartilage Implant is intended for use in the treatment of patients with painful degenerative or post-traumatic arthritis in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, with or without the presence of mild hallux valgus. Cartiva patients return to pre-operative activities faster, require no cast and are immediately full weight bearing. Cartiva is the only approved product for treatment of 1st MTP Osteoarthitis and is less limiting than the alternative of a full surgical fusion of the joint. Intraoperative surgical time is reduced and this procedure results in a substantial reduction in pain and an improved range of motion.

V. SCOPE. 

The existing government transportation personnel and resources will continue to be used to transport patients to the maximum extent possible. Patient transport will be performed by the contractor when government resources are unavailable and other modes of travel (i.e. public transportation, taxi etc.) are ruled out. The VA retains full authority and control over the decisions effecting the operations of VA travel affairs and supervisory/management status over VA personnel. 

The contractor shall not maintain any control or make any changes to VA personnel policies and matters. The contractor shall provide any personnel required to perform in accordance with the contract.  Such contract workers shall not be employees of the VA. The contractor and any subcontractors under the supervision of the contractor shall perform the entire contract services required hereunder.  All personnel engaged in the performance of this transportation contract shall be fully qualified to perform such contract services. The contractor shall assign key personnel (such as safety manager, operations officer, dispatcher), with requisite experience to the contact.  The Contractor shall identify an account manager. The account manager will be the Department s point of contact through which the parties will communicate and resolve all contract accounts receivable, billing and invoicing. If the contractor terminates the employment of any key personnel or if the VA requests their removal from participation in the contract, the contractor shall reassign personnel to the position within seven days of such action.  The VA shall have the right to approve new key personnel, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

All contracted employees are subject to Federal HIPPA and VA information security regulations. 

VII. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

The transportation service will be conducted primarily in the western NY area, to a lesser degree in the Batavia NY area, and with occasional transports throughout VISN 2, which could include trips to rural/remote areas of the region (example: Trips to Jamestown, or Syracuse VAMC, etc.). The transportation cost is from point of pick up to drop off location. Door to door service is required. 
The contractor must be capable of transporting all veterans regardless of size or weight. The mobility devices continue to be upgraded and improved (increase weight and size) to meet the needs of the Veteran population. The contractor will need to remain abreast of these changes and have vehicles and staff to meet the transportation needs. The contractor must also be able to transport Veteran s with oxygen tanks/holders. 
The Medical Center reserves the right to have an escort, such as a relative, or care provider or staff members accompany a Veteran when it s determined that such an escort is in the best interest of the beneficiary. There shall be no additional charge to VA when escorts are authorized to travel with the beneficiary.
If necessary, the contractor may be subject to additional training provided by the VA specific to the needs of the Veteran population. Any additional training will be coordinated with the COTR and the contracting supervisor.

VIII. ESTIMATED USAGE 

The contractor shall have the capacity to perform up to 200 trips per month and handle significant fluctuations in actual trips (potentially 60 trips/month or less).  The contractor should expect an average of about 120 trips per month. The trip estimate includes an aggregate of wheelchair, non-ambulatory and ambulatory trips. The contractor must be able to handle a similar number of trips per month throughout the term of the contract. The VA experiences seasonal and demand changes that the contractor must respond to and accommodate.  Actual usage may be more or less than the given estimate.  The transportation service will primarily be conducted in the WNY area with the bulk of trips.  The transportation company will need to provide transports throughout VISN 2, which could include trips to rural/remote areas of the region (example: Trips to Jamestown, or Syracuse VAMC, etc.), short mileage trips within Olean to Olean General Hospital.  The transportation cost is from point of pick-up to drop off location. 

VIII. RATES AND MILEAGE

BASE RATE: For all one-way trips and no-loads within the threshold limits from a designated pick-up point to a designated delivery point, the contractor shall receive the flat base rate awarded for that trip. The Base Rate shall constitute full compensation for one-way trips which do not exceed the threshold.

MILEAGE RATE: In addition to the base rate, the contractor shall receive the mileage rate awarded for each mile traveled beyond the specified threshold.  This rate applies to loaded, one-way transportation. In the event fraction miles result, VA shall pay the rounded off amount to the next higher whole mile. In no event shall the Contractor receive this rate for miles traveled within the specified threshold.

MILEAGE THRESHOLD: The mileage threshold is defined as within ten (10) driven road miles from the patient s pickup point. Mileage shall be calculated utilizing the latest Internet Google Maps version that provides the shortest route in terms of mileage, or a similar mapping service (i.e. Microsoft, or use of a Global Positioning System within the Vehicle) that provides the shortest route in terms of mileage.

TOLL CHARGES: It is agreed and understood that the prices quoted in the schedule do not include any ferry, bridge, tunnel or road toll charges. Any such legitimate toll charges incurred shall be limited to only loaded trips, and shall be listed separately on the contractor's invoice. The contractor is responsible for all initial EZ PASS or payment of all tolls, to be reimbursed after the fact by VA. Tolls will not be billed or paid for bridges or tunnels used when a non-toll road was feasibly available for the trip.

All invoices must be accompanied by supporting documentation of tolls actually paid (i.e. receipts, EZ Pass invoicing, etc.).

IX. ORDERS:

Ordering Officials: Requests for services shall be made by authorized VA staff only by telephone or email. The contractor will be provided a list of the names and telephone numbers of the persons authorized to place orders upon award of the contract. The contractor must provide a telephone number and email for scheduling trips. Updates will be provided as changes occur. Veterans and other VA employees are not permitted to order transportation at VA expense.  The government will not be held liable for those services performed by the Contractor which are ordered by people who are unauthorized.  

Scheduled Trips: Scheduled requests for services will be furnished to the Contractor no later than 4:30 p.m. prior to the day the transportation is required.  The following information will be provided by the VA to the contractor:

Patient name (first and last name)
Specified nonstandard requirements (amount of steps and/or stairs, 2
                    man assist, oxygen)
Pick up point (include address, telephone #, city, state, bldg and/or room  
                    number if applicable)
Destination/drop-off
Time pick-up is required
Additional information as needed (persons accompanying patient, whether there are papers, medications or other items to be transported with the patient and location of those items)
Any specific physician instructions

Add-on Trips: Any trip ordered the same day, as needed, is an add-on. An order will be generated for an add-on that reflects the date and time the request was received by Contractor.

X. TRIP TICKETS AND TRAVEL CLERK NOTIFICATION:

The driver is required to notify the Travel Unit in person when picking up a patient during regular duty hours of 8am   4:30pm, Monday through Friday.  After 4:30pm, weekends and holidays, the AOD shall be notified at the Admissions desk.

Signed trip tickets for all transports must be provided by the Contractor driver at the time of transport to the VA Travel Unit or AOD.  

All trip tickets should contain the following information: All trip tickets will be completed with the following information written legibly:

Company name
Patient's Name
Date and time of pickup and/or delivery
Vehicle Identification Number
Name of driver
VA employee s signature observing pick-up or delivery occurred

Tickets will be maintained by the COR for record.  Copies of signed trip tickets may also be requested/used for proof of transport for billing purposes.  Failure to comply could result in non-payment.  


XI. PICK-UP PROCEDURES:

When the individual is picked up at a VA facility, the driver or attendant shall notify the Travel Unit or AOD that the Ambulette is waiting.  The driver shall provide the Veteran s name as well as any other pertinent information as to his identification.  The time on the trip ticket will be verified and provided to the facility representative. The patient shall be transported in the method of transport specified when ordered.

When an individual is picked up at his residence, the Veteran will verify the time and sign the trip ticket, or if unable to do so, a member of his household will sign the trip ticket.  The household member will be allowed up to fifteen (15) minutes after this verified time of arrival for preparatory tasks exclusive of boarding activities which shall commence when the individual is ready to be placed in the travel device which will be used to bring him to the waiting vehicle.  The patient shall be transported in an appropriately sized wheelchair appropriately secured to the vehicle.

XII. RESPONSE TIME:

For unscheduled calls for service that originate and terminate within a 15-mile radius of the Buffalo VAMC, the driver must arrive within 45 minutes of the call for service. 

For unscheduled calls for service in all other areas, the contractor shall deploy a driver with a vehicle equipped for the service requested within 30 minutes of a request for service.

<DESC>This is a sources sought Request for Information (RFI) from Army Contracting Command - Colorado Springs (ACC-COS), Contracting &amp; Acquisition Management Office (CAMO), 350 Vandenberg Street, Peterson AFB, CO 80914. The ACC-COS, CAMO, is seeking information from small business firms that are interested and capable of providing alarm response services (unarmed contractor personnel on-site response to IDS annunciations (alarms)) for 2525 Aviation Way and 1555 Newport Rd facilities, Colorado Springs, CO, 80916 when IDS annunciations (alarms) occur at those facilities during non-business hours (6:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m.) Monday through Friday, and during weekends and designated federal holidays; for the period 01 February 2019 through 31 January 2024 in accordance with the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). Based on historical response information, it is expected that the small business contractor would be required to respond to not more than 5 calls (notifications of IDS annunciations (alarms)) per month between each of the locations combined. Contractor response personnel would have to have, at a minimum, a favorable National Agency Check with Inquiries (Tier 1). Contractor response personnel would have to arrive to the site within 15 minutes of notification of an IDS annunciation (alarm) and remain at site until relieved by Government representative; however the contractor response personnel would not be required to remain on site exceeding 60 minutes after arrival.
<p>The period of performance would be 01 February 2019 through 31 January 2024 (basic one year period plus four 1-year option periods).<br />Responses to this RFI should include the following:<br />- Qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience as related to the services described above.<br />- Type labor classifications your firm would use to provide the alarm response services.<br />- Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates for the alarm response services per year through 31 January 2024 including monthly rates and manhours per year, and type labor classifications and labor rates. <br />- Business CAGE code, business size status (large or small), socioeconomic status if you're a small business (SBA certified 8A Program participant, SBA certified small disadvantaged business (SDB), SBA certified HUB Zone firm, service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), veteran owned business, or economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business (EDWOSB)).<br />- Also, if the ROM costs or prices are based on providing the alarm response services under your GSA contract or other government contract, then please reference that government contract number in your response. Otherwise, reference open-market in your response if those ROM costs or prices are based on providing the alarm response services under open-market pricing and terms and conditions.<br />- Point of contact information to include email address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Proprietary information is not being solicited, however, if it is submitted it should be appropriately marked. This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. Nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach that may be chosen at a later date. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for the information requested. Point of contact is George Knowlton, Contracting Officer, ATTN: ACC-COS CAMO (CCAM-CAB). Responses and inquiries will only be accepted electronically by email at: George.P.Knowlton.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for proposals. By way of this Market Survey/Sources Sought Notice, the NSF Office of Polar Programs, U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) and its Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC Leidos) are seeking eligible firms (both large and small businesses) capable of performing the construction services described herein.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE OF SERVICES:<br />Demolish an existing 50-year old sheet pile bulkhead pier and replace with a new larger pier at Palmer Station, Antarctica (-64&deg; 46' 27.00" S, -64&deg; 03' 11.00" W).</p>
<p>The new pier will consist of a steel pile supported concrete deck structure, energy absorbing fender systems, and mooring structures as needed to provide berthing to vessels servicing Palmer Station. A 35% design drawing package has been developed and is provided for reference. Focus will be on the ability to provide berth/docking to vessels that service the pier facility, namely the Laurence M Gould (LMG) and Nathaniel B. Palmer (NBP) as well as other vessels to be identified by Leidos - Antarctic Support Contract (ASC). Final design will be completed, and it is anticipated that a completed design will be issued for bid in 2019.</p>
<p>The new pier facility must integrate into Palmer Station's current utilities and provide the following services: receipt of vessel supplied fuel to station, lighting on the pier, power pedestals for containers, and a utilidor for future installation of potable and salt water lines.</p>
<p>Shore-side access to the new pier will be improved to facilitate movement of shipping container cargo from the pier to existing facilities.</p>
<p>The existing pier, a steel sheet pile cofferdam bulkhead backfilled with gravel and cobble is to be demolished and materials re-used as much as practicable in the new pier facility. Some of the fill is to be stockpiled for future use by Palmer Station.</p>
<p>Information on the LMG and NBP can be found using the links below:</p>
<p>https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/vesselScienceAndOperations/documents/NBP_Guide.pdf</p>
<p>https://www.usap.gov/USAPgov/vesselScienceAndOperations/documents/LMG_Guide.pdf</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>Contract Award: 2020<br />Start Pier Construction: 2021<br />Project Complete: 2022</p>
<p><br />Special Considerations</p>
<p>1. It is the Government's intent for any solicitation and construction contract to be managed by the Antarctic Support Contractor (ASC Leidos). A logistics plan will need to be developed in conjunction with ASC to transport to and from Palmer Station all personnel, material, and equipment for this project. The selected subcontractor should be as self-sufficient as possible. However, a joint logistics plan with ASC could be developed. Approximately 20-person berthing and messing facilities may be considered available at Palmer Station. Any other facilities the contractor must provide in support of this project.</p>
<p>2. There is no air transportation link to Palmer Station; the only access is via ship. USAP transportation to Palmer Station includes a minimum 3-day ship passage from Punta Arenas, Chile with a transit across the Drake Passage.</p>
<p>3. The construction site is a remote site with no available locally sourced construction materials or equipment. There are no construction resources or construction equipment available to a contractor at the site. All material to be used in construction of the pier must be procured elsewhere. The contractor must provide all equipment, materials, temporary power and lighting necessary for this project and will have minimal laydown area on land to support construction.</p>
<p>4. The construction season is limited, typically October to June based on weather, sea, and land ice. Daylight may be an issue because of the geographic location of the construction site. Construction shall last less than one year to comply with environmental permitting.</p>
<p>5. The existing pier is the only point at which supplies and equipment may be landed at Palmer Station. There is a small boat ramp adjacent to the existing pier consisting of 6-inch concrete planks with a load limit of 27k lbs. per axle.</p>
<p>6. All individuals traveling to Antarctica for this solicitation must pass a Physical Qualification exam. Limited medical support provided by a physician in the station's medical clinic can be provided at Palmer Station. In the event of a medical emergency ASC Leidos will assist with medical evacuation for contractor personnel.</p>
<p>7. Contractor must comply with all U.S. and International laws (i.e., US Antarctic Treaty, MARPOL, etc.) as applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requested Information</p>
<p>This Agency requests that interested contractors complete the following questions to assist the Government in its efforts.</p>
<p>1. Firm's name and BUSINESS SIZE, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address and DUNS Number/Cage Code.</p>
<p>2. Is your company currently registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) formerly known as the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) Database? If not, has it been registered, or does it plan to register?</p>
<p>3. Is the potential offeror capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for a project valued between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000?</p>
<p>4. Does the potential offeror have experience related to the work described for this project? If so, please provide a list of examples and dates of projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of Information</p>
<p>Any interested firm should submit written responses that address their ability to provide the requirements described herein and include associated specifications. NSF and/or ASC may follow-up with respondents for additional information or questions as necessary.</p>
<p>Please do not submit any proprietary information in your response.</p>
<p>Responses shall not exceed five pages and must be submitted via e-mail to the contacts listed in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) notice no later than February 7, 2019. E-mail submissions are requested. Please reference "Palmer Station Pier Replacement" in the email subject line. Any questions should be directed to the NSF Contracting Office.</p>
<p>Be advised that submissions will not be returned.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought notice will be treated as information only and considered as part of the Government's market research.</p>
<p><br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This Sources Sought does not constitute a request for proposals and submission responses are purely voluntary. The Government assumes no financial responsibility for costs incurred in responding to this notice.</p>

The Technically Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (TAGARS) is part of the Aerospace Medical Equipment Needs (AMEN) Phase II acquisition program, which was established to continue to provide urgent upgrades to the aging and obsolete research laboratory equipment of the two CAMI research divisions.  The AMEN 2 program is a continuation of AMEN 1.  AMEN 1, a non-NAS Technology Refreshment (TR) effort, Acquisition Category level 5 (ACAT-5), approved on 24 May 2010, was established to replace research laboratory equipment at CAMI.  AMEN 2, a non-NAS Information Technology (IT) acquisition effort, was approved by the Acquisition Executive Board (AEB) as a TR ACAT-5, on 11 June 2013.  It was later designated to be a Variable Quantity (VQ) ACAT-5 effort on 30 April 2014 and tailored to move directly to the Final Investment Decision (FID) of the Acquisition Management System (AMS) process, scheduled to occur on 16 September 2015.  The AMEN 2 program requirements are presented in the AMEN 2 final Program Requirements Document (fPRD).

The TAGARS supports the laboratories in the Division, which focus on improving human performance through enhanced equipment design, interface design, agency workforce optimization, investigations of work environment issues, and organizational effectiveness.  This work is conducted by the Flight Deck Human Research Laboratory (FDHFRL, AAM-510) and the NAS Human Factors Safety Research Laboratory (NASHFSRL, AAM-520).

The AHFRD is replacing the Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS), and older single-engine reciprocating (piston) engine research simulator with a new high-fidelity flight simulator for the purpose of continuing advanced general aviation research in established areas and expanding into others of technically advanced cockpit designs that could not properly supported with our existing simulator, but could not be supported by a current-generation simulation device.

The AHFRD has a requirement to update the technology of its aviation simulator infrastructure.  The technical update includes hardware and software acquisition, installation and training with follow-on annual maintenance of the software components in support of the TAGARS system.  
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) 6973GH-18-R-00113 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  
This procurement is not a set-aside.   The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 1,000 employees.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (July 11, 2018).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), “if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.”

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, stephanie.riddle@faa.gov, no later than 3:00 p.m. CT, July 11, 2018.  

Offerors submitting proposals by hand-delivery will need to consider allowing sufficient time to process through the security procedures in place at MMAC.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO may also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for the special mail-handling procedures in place at MMAC.

In addition, if all requested information is not furnished in the offeror's proposal, the offeror's proposal may be determined to be non-responsive and ineligible for consideration for contract award.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

<DESC>The mission of the U.S. Coal Resources and Reserves Assessment Project (Coal Project) is to assess the coal resources and reserves of the Nation.  To complete this mission the Coal Project collects, compiles ,and processes large amounts of data.  Most of this data are from cola exploration drill hole logs.  These coal exploration drill hole logs are stored in electronic databases.  The Coal Project is in the process of transitioning these electronic databases from a software package that does not comply with USGS IT standards to a Microsoft Access database package that has been specifically designed to compile, process and store coal exploration drill hole data.   The data from the non-compliant database have been downloaded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for temporary storage.  Due to limited availability of Coal Project staff, an outside contractor is needed to assist with processing and uploading the coal exploration drill hole data from the Excel spreadsheets into the new Access-based Drill Hole Databases (DHDB) package.  The DHDB software package is a proprietary software developed to assist with compiling, processing, and uploading any new r additional coal exploration drill hole data that may be obtained by the Coal Project.   
Requests for information and subsequent responses may be emailed or mailed to the point-of-contact specified below. Firms are cautioned that this is NOT a solicitation. All costs associated with providing information as requested by this Notice shall be the responsibility of the responding firm.

<DESC>Description:<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice. This Sources Sought neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This Sources Sought Notice is in support of a market survey being conducted by the St. Louis District, Corps of Engineers to identify interested Contractors within the District area for the Scope of Work listed below. The following are general capabilities required to perform the Scope of Work according to USACE standards. The Contractor must be capable to perform the Scope of Work listed below.
<p>General Project Description:<br />The East St. Louis Flood Control Project or Metro East Sanitary District (MESD) levees are generally located along the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, between Edwardsville, Illinois and Cahokia, Illinois. The MESD Stations 973+00 to 1015+00 levee segment along the Mississippi River is the location where the deep cutoff wall is to be constructed.</p>
<p>Work Statement:<br />Construction of approximately one continuous section of a deep cutoff wall totaling approximately 4200 linear feet which tie into bedrock, degrade of levee slope and placement of compacted impervious clay fill is needed.</p>
<p>*****MESD Deep Cutoff Wall:<br />The work provided for herein consists of furnishing all plant, labor, equipment, and material, except earth material from required excavations, and performing all operations necessary for construction of a deep soil-cement-bentonite cutoff wall. MESD deep slurry trench will be panel constructed as a continuous soil-cement-bentonite cutoff wall approximately 120-140 feet deep and tying 2 feet into bedrock, approximately 4200 feet long and a minimum of two feet wide. The slurry wall will be tied into limestone bedrock approximately 120 to 140 feet below existing ground. Construction of the cutoff wall will require a temporary work platform approximately 5 - 10 feet thick. Other construction activities will include removal of unsuitable materials from the riverside face of the existing levee and placement of a minimum 5 foot thick clay cap on the riverside levee face. The subsurface conditions typically consist of 1 to 10 feet of clay material underlain by approximately 110 to 130 feet of sands, gravels, and cobbles. Below the sands is bedrock which the cutoff wall will tie into. Borings in the area indicate occasional rough drilling and the presence of occasional buried rubble (glass, wood, metal). The borings do not indicate continuous layers of rough drilling or rubble at the depths of the proposed cutoff wall. There are a variety of utility crossings along the alignment that might affect construction sequencing. <br />The soil-cement-bentonite cutoff wall will be required to meet strict QA/QC requirements. For example, the soil-cement-bentonite must meet a minimum permeability requirement of 1x10-6cm/s, clay cap material must meet USCS classification for CL or CH material, in place clay cap material will need to meet 95 percent of the maximum dry density and plus 4 and minus 0 percent of the optimum water content of a standard proctor test. The cutoff wall will also require detailed as-builts. Lab testing and/or in-situ testing will likely be required to verify compliance with permeability requirements.</p>
<p>******* Capability Statements:<br />1. Explain your capability to panel construct a continuous soil-cement-bentonite cutoff wall to depths of 120 to 140 feet, and maintain the slurry within 2 feet of the ground surface.<br />2. Briefly explain working in varied soil conditions to include but not limited to sand, gravels, zones of cobbles, and zones of boulders.<br />3. Explain your capability to verify permeability requirements through permeability testing of wet grab samples obtained from various depths.<br />SOURCE SOUGHT:</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction<br />SIZE STANDARD: $36.5 Million<br />CONTRACT ESTIMATED RANGE: $10,000,000 to $25,000,000</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources; (2) A list of any DHS Strategic Sourcing and/or GWAC contracts held by the qualified business source submitting a capability statement, including the contract vehicle, contract number, ordering period, and contract ceiling; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition is 541519: Software Installation Services, Computer. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to procure commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) case management software for a technology refresh of the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) Enforcement and Adjudication (E &amp; A) modules.</p>
<p>The MISLE system is the USCG's primary operations business support system. The MISLE system has been in steady-state operation since calendar year 2002. USCG personnel use the MISLE system to schedule and record operational activities such as vessel boardings, facility inspections, marine casualty investigations, pollution response actions, law enforcement actions, and search and rescue operations.</p>
<p>In September 2015, the USCG completed a major technology refresh of the MISLE system (MISLE version 5.0). The MISLE 5.0 system consists of a new .Net Windows Forms graphical user interface (GUI) application that runs on the USCG's Windows workstation Standard Image (currently Windows 10.3), a .NET middle tier running on the USCG's Windows Server Standard image via Platform as a Service, and a SQL Server backend for the MISLE database storing 20 terabytes of operational data. Additionally, the MISLE 5.0 system uses the Coast Guard enterprise service bus (i.e. the Production Service Oriented Architecture system) to exchange data (one way or two-way data flows) with 17 other USCG information systems. Due to resource and schedule constraints, the E &amp; A modules of MISLE were not addressed during the MISLE 5.0 technology refresh.</p>
<p>The E &amp; A modules of MISLE currently in use are custom coded in Visual Basic 6 programming language, which is no longer supported by the Microsoft vendor. The Enforcement module receives and stores incident/enforcement Activity data referrals from the MISLE 5.0 system while making the referred Activity available for additional review for enforcement action and/or adjudication proceedings when an alleged violation has been determined via investigation or referral from an authorized USCG official. The Enforcement module is mainly used by USCG personnel conducting enforcement operations and the Coast Guard Hearing Office staff. The Adjudication functionality in MISLE, which also contains an integrated Docket Management System (DMS), accepts incident and referential data for specific types of enforcement activities, suspension and revocation, and Class II administrative civil penalties enforcement activities, which are adjudicated by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The Adjudication module is exclusively utilized by the ALJ and provides an element of enterprise workflow management.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:<br /></strong>This requirement is for development of a COTS based case management software product to be used for developing a modernized Enforcement and Adjudication capability for the MISLE system (MISLE version 5.1). The Enforcement module and Adjudication module functional requirement documents are provided as Attachment 1 and Attachment 2. Additionally, the COTS case management software must be compatible with the USCG's Microsoft Windows Server image/Platform as a Service hosting environment and the USCG's Windows 10 Secure Host Baseline workstation. The COTS case management software product must support integration with the existing MISLE 5.0 system consisting of a Microsoft .Net framework with a Microsoft SQL Server backend database.&nbsp;It must allow for routine security/bug-fix patching and major version upgrades without major impact on implemented workflow functionality. After delivery of full operational capability, Offeror shall provide semi-annual patch releases for remainder of the period of performance.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong>The USCG anticipates that a firm-fixed-price procurement will be awarded on or around 1 March 2019 for twelve months with four-twelve month option periods included. Initial operational capability meeting 75 percent or more of the capabilities outlined in the requirement documentation shall be complete by the end of the twelve month period with full operational capability complete in the following six months, equaling eighteen months total for a system functioning at full operational capability. Annual assessments will be conducted for programmatic review as well contractual performance.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br /></strong>Interested business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 pages (12-point font minimum), including all attachments. <br /><br />Submitted statements shall address the following:</p>
<p>1. Eligible business concern's name, point of contact, address, and DUNS number should be included.<br />2. A brief description of how the COTS case management software product supports configurable rules driven case management workflows.<br />3. A brief description of successful case management system implementations based on the COTS case management software product with the Coast Guard or with other Department of Homeland Security components, and other Federal Government Agencies.<br />4. A brief description of how the COTS software product would capture case statistics and measurements for case management and status reporting.<br />5. A brief description of how the COTS software product would support integration with an existing system running on the Microsoft Windows Server/Microsoft .Net framework platform with a Microsoft SQL Server backend database.<br />6. A brief description of how the COTS case management software product would support integration with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and the Microsoft Office suite of applications.<br />7. A brief description of how the COTS software product would utilize a Common Access Card (CAC) and Active Directory (AD) as the technical means for user authentication and role based access.<br />8. A brief description of how the COTS case management software product would support data conversion of existing case data to the COTS case management software product (i.e. automate data conversion tooling). <br />9. Describe the benefits of using the case management software product that your firm offers. <br />10. Does your firm currently have any Authorization to Operate (ATO) for your case management software product? If so, please identify the approving or authorizing organization. <br />11.

In addition to on-site CMOP locations above, work may be performed at remote locations with prior concurrence of the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and notification by the Contracting Office (CO) of location.  The National CMOP Office requires the need for Automation Support Services that will provide concurrent engineering and subject matter expertise for the many different types of automated and semi-automated production systems. The Contractor is to provide the technical framework that will enable sound decision making, increase product knowledge, ensure system maturity and mitigate risks associated with changes to the production systems. The Contractor will be instrumental to CMOP by providing a methodology to plan, manage, and implement technical activities throughout all phases of the acquisition life cycle. 

Contract Type 
This will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract.  Task orders will be issued by warranted contracting officers of Network Contracting Office 15, CMOP Acquisitions, authorizing services.  The guaranteed minimum award amount for this contract is $1,000.00. The maximum aggregate value of orders that can be placed under this contract is $2,000,000.00.   The Government does not guarantee that it will place any orders under this contract in excess of the guaranteed minimum award amount. 

Background
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program serves over 7 million enrolled Veterans, dispensing over 110 million prescriptions per year for Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC s) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC s) throughout the United States (US). There is a total of seven CMOP facilities strategically located throughout the US that rely heavily upon automated and semi-automated systems in order to fulfill prescription orders. The type, age and reliability of the automation systems and sub-systems vary by CMOP. Increased throughput demands are forcing CMOP sites in transition from older systems to newer more advanced pharmacy systems that are available in today s market. Some CMOP sites are acquiring full Automated Prescription Fulfillment Systems (APFS) that consist of tablet /capsule automation (TCA), unit-of-use automation (UOU), automated labeling subsystems, manual and bulk processing subsystems and automated packaging equipment while others are integrating new sub-systems into their existing systems. The new systems and sub-systems must be properly designed, tested, evaluated, and validated to ensure quality and patient safety. 

Each CMOP has tablet/pill dispensers, unit of use dispensers, manual and bulk fill areas, and automated packing areas.  There has been hardware/software developed and maintained for the CMOP Production System for the past twelve (12) years which interfaces with each of the dispensing areas. It is important for Contractors to understand that improvements have allowed CMOPs to grow in functionality and speed to fill rates far beyond the original intended rates. This speed of performance is important to be maintained as future enhancements or systems are introduced into each CMOP.

The following list of equipment is intended to provide a sense of the diversity of equipment types found in the CMOP facilities. Examples include but are not limited to;

Automated Prescription Fulfillment System (APFS)
Tablet and Capsule Automation (TCA)
A-Frames   pre-packaged medication dispensing equipment
Automated Dispensing Units   feed and label pre-filled containers
Independent Pill Dispensers 
Auto-Baggers or other Automated Packing equipment including attached weighing equipment

<DESC>The NRC intends to noncompetitively procure 42 user licenses to West LegalEdCenter with West, A Thomson Reuters Business; 610 Opperman Dr., Saint Paul, MN 55123-1340. West LegalEdCenter is a continuing legal education (CLE) library of more than 7,000 programs and 20,000 hours of CLE available, covering every area of practice, most of which is offered in an on-demand format and can be accessed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week from any electronic device with an internet connection. The procurement of the licenses provides access to the required online CLE programs for agency attorneys. Most NRC attorneys practice at the NRC Headquarters in the National Capital Region but are licensed in several various states. As a condition of employment, NRC attorneys are required to maintain an active license in a state, district, or territory. Depending on individual state bar requirements, attorneys are generally required to complete a specific number of CLE courses or hours in order to maintain their active status. The NRC therefore intends to procure online CLE training to enable NRC attorneys to accomplish their CLE requirements at dates and times that are the most beneficial for the agency while eliminating the travel and other costs associated with traditional classroom training.
<p>This noncompetitive acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Only one source reasonably available.</p>

<DESC>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI). The USAF solicits responses to this RFI, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain technical information, delivery, and other market information or capabilities for planning purposes for the Advanced Radar Threat System-Variant 1 (ARTS-V1) Program. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary and no information will be returned. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information obtained will be considered market research and may be used as a general concept, however any specific information will be treated as proprietary information, if so marked.
<p>1.1 The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which has a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran&shy; Owned, Hub-zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code, if applicable. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services provided to the Government and to commercial customers within the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work that will be accomplished by the teaming partners. The information provided will be used to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government will not provide reimbursement for the information provided.</p>
<p>1.2 All potential bidders wanting access to the restricted files in the attached bidder's library must request access via www.FBO.gov only. To obtain access, a potential bidder must be a qualified U.S. contractor with a legitimate business purpose. A qualified U.S. contractor is one that has an approved DD Form 2345 on file with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office. The potential bidder requesting access must provide a copy of their current approved DD Form 2345.</p>
<p>2. PROGRAM DETAILS:</p>
<p>2.1 The Range Threat System Program Office (SPO) is considering issuing a competitive contract for future production of an estimated seven ARTS-V1 systems, with potential for additional production units. The Range Threat SPO anticipates a fixed-price type contract with a production period of three to four years long (note the notional schedule in section 2.3.2 and the V1 production contract award estimate).</p>
<p>2.2 System Description: ARTS-V1 shall track and engage multiple targets simultaneously, and be capable of engaging fixed aircraft. The weapon system is manned by five operators and is reactive to aircrew/aircraft defensive measures. The weapon systems are integrated on a transportable, robust and ruggedized system, capable of traveling on all range terrain to include driving on gravel, dirt and paved roads. The system shall provide threat representative full effective radiated power, replicate threat signals, antenna patterns, operational modes and threat tactic capabilities. The system must be capable of weapons simulation for engagement scoring purposes as well send real-time radar data to the Range Control Center (RCC) or Live Missions Operations Center (LMOC) in conjunction with the range's Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS)-controlled threat environment for processing and analysis.</p>
<p>2.2.1 The ARTS-V1 system includes antenna, transmitters, all command, control, and communications (C3) equipment, power generation equipment, and any other ground support equipment necessary to facilitate a true-to-threat site footprint.</p>
<p>2.3 Current Phase: ARTS-V1 is currently in Milestone B development, and is acquiring a Government Level III Technical Data Package (TDP) with a Production Representative Article (PRA) under the Closed Loop Passive Electronically&nbsp;Scanned Array Simulator (CLPS) contract. The CLPS program is managed by the Naval office in Patuxent River delivering test ground systems to the Nevada Test and Training Range.</p>
<p>2.3.1 Future Production Strategy: The Range Threat SPO intends to award a future production contract to industry. This contract would be production of an estimated seven ARTS-V1 systems in accordance with the Government Level III TDP, with the potential for additional units. Any component or subsystem deviation to the Government Level III TDP would require acceptance testing and TDP design change authorization by the Government.</p>
<p>2.3.2 Notional ARTS-V1 Schedule (with Fiscal Year dates): <br />&bull; Build-out of the PRA estimated completion: 2nd Quarter 2021 <br />&bull; Final Air Force testing estimated completion: Mid-2022 <br />&bull; V1 Government Level III TDP estimated completion: Mid-2022 <br />&bull; V1 "Build-To-Print" Production Request For Proposal (RFP) estimated release: <br />Mid-2022<br />&bull; V1 "Build-To-Print" Production Contract estimated award: Mid-2023<br />&bull; Final V1 Production Delivery required: 4th Quarter 2026 or earlier</p>
<p>2.4 The ARTS-V1 Technical Data Package (TDP) is planned to be a comprehensive source file capable of supporting competitive procurement, re-manufacturing, operational mission requirements, and total organic system sustainment of both hardware and software. The Government Level III TDP is currently unavailable. The Range Threat SPO expects initial CLPS TDP release by March 2019 and the full ARTS-V1 level III TDP by April 2022. Since the Government Level III TDP is currently unavailable, the SPO has concept drawings and diagrams posted for access. These concept documents are made available to give industry an idea of the scope of the production effort (Please note that questions and comments concerning the RFI or the TDP with Government responses will be consolidated into one document and released via FBO).</p>
<p>2.5 AFLCMC/HBZ, Aerospace Dominance Enabler Division, Hill AFB, UT intends to award a single-award contract to field the ARTS-V1 system(s).</p>
<p>3. INDUSTRY RESPONSE: All information submitted shall be Unclassified. Information submitted containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. Information submitted will be retained at AFLCMC/HBZCD and will not be returned. The Government requests the information be submitted in electronic format to Sean Jones and/or Melissa Huston no later than 25 January 2019. If there is a need for questions and/or feedback to be at the SECRET level, the responding party will contact the POC listed in the RFI and mail via CD to the following address:<br /><br />AFLCMC/HBZCD<br />7338 LONCKI STREET, BLDG 344<br />HILL AFB, UT 84056<br />Attn: Maj Matthew Horlacher, Comm: 801-777-9009</p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The Aircraft Battle Damage Repair program (USAF AFMC AFSC/LGPM) is seeking to procure engineering of War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Tool and Equipment Trailers capable of housing tooling and aircraft hardware, listed in Attachment 2, to include 4' x 8' sheets of metal and 8' metal tubing/extrusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current Aircraft Battle Damage Repair WRM Trailers, otherwise known as War Wagons, are built on top of old demilitarized MHU-12 and MHU-141 ammo trailers (see pictures in Attachment 3). Provisions were added to house tool cabinets and sheet metal in order to support the ABDR mission. Through attrition, new aircraft have dictated additional tooling be added in order to support changing mission requirements. Trailers are stored in facilities ranging from fully enclosed supply buildings, to open ended hangar storage, but are deployed to Forward Operating Bases, and improvised landing locations outside in order to support mission requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the attached Trailer Requirements document (Attachment 1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If, after reviewing the Trailer Requirements, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales-and product specifications related to this effort. Also indicate if you are the manufacturer, or provide the name and size of the manufacturer of the product(s) you will be supplying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.).</p>

<DESC><span>This Notice applies to the US Army Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program administered by the Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), and for which the contracting activity is the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal (ACC-RSA), Alabama. This program is comprised of BPAs in four Domains utilizing five NAICS codes: Business &amp; Analytical 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services), Logistics 541614 (Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services), Programmatic 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services), Technical (Research &amp; Development 541715 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology)), and Technical (Non-R&amp;D 541330 -- Engineering Services).</span>
<p>The intent of this Notice is to provide a clarification to both verbiage and prior usage that gives the impression of a limitation on the program that does not exist. In principle, all Department of Army Agencies, commands, and installations are permitted to use the EXPRESS Program for any advisory or non-advisory and assistance professional services procurements that fit within the Scopes of Work formulated for each of the four Domains. By historic practice, only AMCOM and its immediate customers have placed task orders (calls) against the existing program of BPAs. The updated strategy for EXPRESS Evergreen was approved by the Senior Services Manager, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (DASA(P)) in February 2017. It anticipated global usage due to the expectation that Army missions would be realigned across the Army, for example, with the stand-up of Army Futures Command. DASA(P) approval provided that this strategic sourcing tool could be used by Army customers across the globe to obtain services in a timely and cost effective manner. This Notice of Intent explicitly clarifies that the BPAs under the EXPRESS program are appropriate for Army-wide usage without limitation.</p>
<p>All currently existing BPAs will be modified no later than 31 January 2019 to implement this clarification. The EXPRESS program performs an annual review to determine if it is necessary to issue a solicitation for the purpose of adding additional BPA holders to existing Domains, or if new Domains are needed. The EXPRESS program office will continue to insure appropriate evaluations are made to support the Army's mission and the new Army structure.</p>

<SUBJECT>NASA Heliophysics Explorers Program 2019 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity Planning Information
<SOLNBR>NNH19ZDA008L
<CONTACT>Dr. Dan Moses, Heliophysics Explorers Program Lead Scientist, Science Mission Directorate, Email dan.moses@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) intends to release a DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for 2019 Heliophysics Medium-class Explorers (MIDEX) missions in January 2019 and a Final AO for 2019 Heliophysics MIDEX missions in June 2019. The Heliophysics Explorers Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMD's heliophysics programs under a not-to-exceed cost cap. It is anticipated that no more than three 2019 Heliophysics MIDEX investigations will be selected for 9-month, $1.25M (FY19) Phase A concept studies through this AO. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned that at least one MIDEX investigation will be down-selected to continue into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. Multiple missions may be down-selected if their total cost remains below the cost cap. There will be no Missions of Opportunity (MO) solicited as part of this AO nor through an accompanying Program Element Appendix to the SALMON-3 AO. The DRAFT and Final AOs will appear on the NSPIRES Solicitations Page: <strong>https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>
<div>
<p>NASA recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive scientific, engineering, and technology communities, and fully expects that such values will be reflected in the composition of all proposal teams as well as peer review panels (science, engineering, and technology), science definition teams, and mission and instrument teams.</p>
<p>Heliophysics Explorers Program investigations must address NASA's heliophysics science objectives as described in <em>2018 NASA Strategic Plan and the 2014 NASA Science Plan</em>.</p>
<p>NASA values the use of innovative, new technologies and encourages the demonstration of them in mission-relevant environments. MIDEX Program investigations may therefore propose PI-Team-Developed Enabling and Enhancing Technology Demonstration Opportunities (TDOs) to demonstrate new capabilities. PI-Team-Developed Enhancing TDOs, like Science Enhancement Opportunities (SEOs), are funded outside of the cost cap and may possibly not be selected even if the parent mission is selected for flight.</p>
<p>NASA endeavours to provide NASA-developed technologies for NASA-Developed Enabling TDOs on science missions. The specific technologies to be offered for 2019 Heliphysics MIDEX have not yet been determined. More information about NASA-developed technologies will be announced at a future date.</p>
<p>Launch Vehicle costs and procurement will be the responsibility of NASA. Launch vehicle standard services will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment,&nbsp;and the cost will not be included in the cost cap. The cost of mission specific and special launch services is the responsibility of the PI and must be included within the cost cap.</p>
<p>Foreign contributions to science instruments should not exceed approximately one-third of the science payload. Proposals shall include a discussion of the scale of the internationally-contributed instruments, how the proposed contribution is consistent with NASA's policy that the contribution does not exceed approximately one-third of the science payload,  and how the programmatic risks associated with the contribution will be handled.</p>
<p>Investigations will be capped at a Phase A-F cost of $250M (FY19), excluding standard launch services. A 25% minimum unencumbered cost reserve on Phases A-D will be required within the cost cap. Lower-cost investigations and cost-efficient operations are encouraged.</p>
<p>The time frame for the solicitation is intended to be:</p>
<p>Release of Draft AO - January 2019 <br />Release of final AO - June 2019  <br />Pre-proposal conference - ~3 weeks after final AO release<br />Proposals due - 90 days after AO release<br />Down-selection - 4th Quarter 2021 (target)<br />Launch readiness date - NLT February 2026</p>
<p>The 2019 Heliophysics MIDEX AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template version 5.0 available at <strong>http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html</strong>. Proposers should read the AO carefully when it is released. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this notification or the planned 2019 Heliophysics MIDEX AO are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.</p>
<p>Further information will be posted, as it becomes available, on the website of the Science Office for Mission Assessments (SOMA) of NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) at <strong>https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/</strong> in the 2019 Heliophysics MIDEX Acquisition Pages.</p>

<DESC>This is a Special Notice of the government's intent to procure EdgeTech PORT LF acoustic releases along with the hardware to couple them together. These acoustic releases will be used on moorings used for long term monitoring with oceanographic sensor or passive acoustic recorders.
<p>The Cetacean Research Program (CRP) has an existing inventory of 19 EdgeTech acoustic releases used as part of the mooring system for passive acoustic recorders. All acoustic releases must be able to communicate with our inventory of three EdgeTech acoustic command boxes and individual releases must be able to be combined with any other release in our inventory to provide redundant release system. The acoustic command boxes use proprietary command codes specific to EdgeTech releases. Therefore, acoustic releases from a different company would not be compatible with CRP's existing command boxes and would require purchasing command boxes in addition to the acoustic release. Further, coupling a release of a different brand or type with any of our EdgeTech releases would require additional cost to fabricate new coupling hardware, and may require redesign of the mooring system to accommodate releases of different size and or weight.</p>
<p>PIFSC proposes to purchase the required instrumentation on a sole source basis from EdgeTech, LLC. The Government intends to acquire the equipment using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed-price purchase order with an approximate delivery date of January 15, 2019. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511 with a corresponding size standard of 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>This Special Notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available; however, potential sources who believe they have the expertise and capability to meet the requirements may submit such documentation to the attention of the Contracting Officer via email at Stephanie.M.Garnett@noaa.gov no later than Thursday, December 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. HST. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete this requirement is solely the Government's discretion as it is the Government's belief that only Edgetech, LLC. can provide the requirements as stated above.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information, and to register, please see www.sam.gov. All offerors must also obtain a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.</p>

<CONTACT>Rebecca Harmon, Phone 843-760-3358, Email rebecca.harmon@ati.org
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) that aims&nbsp;to develop a lead prototype compound (pre-clinical candidate) that must be efficacious against clinically-relevant gram negative bacteria in animal infection models, have clinically acceptable<br />pharmacokinetics (PK) and dynamics for oral or parenteral administration, and a low-to-acceptable toxicity profile. The focus of this RPP is to recruit a partner(s) (i.e., antibiotic (AB)-focused pharmaceutical companies and/or product-focused academic/non-profit research institutions) to move an AB hit or early lead molecule from lead optimization or early preclinical development to a preclinical decision.<br /><br />Technical Objective: The WRAIR CARB effort is a sub-set of the 2015 CARB Presidential initiative wherein WRAIR was tasked to develop a preclinical AB candidate within five years. The goal of this MTEC award is to develop a small molecule AB candidate or chemical series with the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Efficacious against clinically-relevant, MDR, Gram-negative bacteria in mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 panels of relevant, MDR, clinical isolates. This efficacy can be either genus specific (narrow spectrum) for Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, or Pseudomonas species, or broadly effective against clinical Gram-negative pathogens.<br />&bull; Efficacious against clinically-relevant MDR Gram-negative bacteria in standard animal soft tissue infection models (e.g., thigh and lung).<br />&bull; In vitro and in vivo data supporting clinically acceptable PK and dynamics for oral or parenteral administration, an acceptable toxicity profile.<br /><br />Potential for Follow-on Work: The initial 24 month delivery schedule should be focused on the execution of animal testing and manufacturing required for an IND application for the desired indications. Follow-on work in subsequent years may be awarded to support:<br /><br />&bull; Conduct of clinical trials pursuant to an FDA marketing approval (New Drug Approval).<br />&bull; Development of validated assays used to determine efficacy and potency of the product.<br />&bull; Development of a GMP manufacturing capability.<br />&bull; Conduct of collaborative animal testing to support FDA filings, such as toxicity studies.<br /><br />The Period of Performance (POP)/delivery schedule is not to exceed 24 months.<br /><br />Acquisition Approach<br />This RPP will be conducted using a two-staged approach. In Stage 1, current MTEC members are invited to submit White Papers using the format contained in the RPP. The Sponsor (i.e., WRAIR) will evaluate White Papers submitted and will select White Papers that best meet their current technology priorities using the criteria in the RPP. Offerors whose technology solution is selected for further consideration based on White Paper evaluation will be invited to submit a proposal in Stage 2. Notification letters will contain specific Stage 2 proposal submission requirements. Offerors whose Stage 1 white papers are invited to Stage 2 of the RPP process for submission of full proposals will have an opportunity to interface directly with WRAIR so that they can provide the<br />appropriate level of detail into their development plans. MTEC will make an introduction to the appropriate WRAIR contact to those Offerors that are invited to submit full proposals at Stage 2 of the RPP process.<br /><br />See the attachment for details of this RPP.<br /><br />Administrative Information<br />White papers are due no later than January 24, 2019 at 12:00pm ET. The RPP is posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and a summary notice is posted on FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties. MTEC membership is required for the submission of a white paper in response to this upcoming MTEC RPP. Offerors<br />submitting White Papers as the prime contractor must be MTEC members of good standing by January 21, 2019. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/<br /><br />A Proposers Conference via webinar will be held for interested parties to have their questions answered by the Government after the RPP is posted. MTEC Members will be notified when the Proposers Conference is scheduled.<br /><br />For more information about the RPP, please visit the MTEC website (a link is included in the attachment incorporated into this posting).

<p>The following attachments apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>Attachment A - Terms and Conditions<br />Attachment B - Redacted Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a non-competitive Sole Source Purchase Order will be awarded as a result of this notice pending the availability of funds. It is the Government's belief that Leonardo SPA only has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to provide the spare parts. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these parts are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within four (4) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted by the Offeror must include a letter from the OEM verifying the OEM will provide proprietary data. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered. This notice of intent will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV.</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>The closing date for this intent to award notice is December 13, 2018 at 4:00 pm ET. Anticipated award date is on or about December 16, 2018. Point of contact for this intent to award notice is Lisa.A.Daum@uscg.mil.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Price <br />(ii) Technical Capability</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Initially offerors shall be ranked according to price, including the 6 month option to extend services. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the totals for CLINs 0001, 1001, 2001, 3001, and 4001 for PMI Services; CLINs 0002, 1002, 2002, 3002, and 4002 for Routine Repairs; and CLINs 0003, 1003, 2003, 3003, and 4003 for Emergency Repairs. Include pricing for the evaluation of the 6 month extension of services, CLINs 5001, 5002, and 5003. Price will be evaluated with respect to a fair and reasonable price. An offeror whose price is determined to be unbalanced or unreasonable may not be considered for award.<br /><br /><strong>Technical:</strong> Next, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical capability submitted by the lowest-priced offeror on an acceptable/unacceptable (pass/fail) basis. The offeror's proposal will be rated Acceptable or Unacceptable as defined in Table 1. If the lowest priced offeror is deemed to be acceptable that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is deemed unacceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated for technical acceptability and the process will continue (in order of lowest price) until an offeror is judged acceptable. <br /><strong><br />Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings:<br /></strong><br /><strong>1. Acceptable:</strong> Proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>2. Unacceptable:</strong> Proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br /><br /><strong>52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEVIATION 2018-O0021) (SEP 2018)<br /><br /></strong>(a) Comptroller General Examination of Record.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Solicitation: FA8526-19-Q-0007</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none">This requirement is for a firm-fixed price contract with three (1) year options for <span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">BOX,STORAGE F117 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">ENGINE FAN BLADES</span>; NSN: 8145-01-326-2577BA; P/N 17G233094-1. The basic is for quantity of one (1) each (includes first article), test plan (1 lo), and test report (1 lo). The three (1) year options are based on quantity range of 1-2 each. A pneumatic vacuum cleaner, P/N 747-04 (SERO 460014) is used to depuddle a fuel tank prior to performing maintenance on the tank. Depuddling is the removal of residual puddles of fuel which remain after defueling and purging. The c-17 aircraft is powered by Pratt and Whitney fll7-pw-100 high-bypass turbofan engines. Periodically, it will be necessary to remove/replace the fan exit fairing assembly while the engine is on-wing. To gain access to the fan exit fairing, it will be necessary to remove 18 pairs of the 1st stage fan blades. The maintenance platform, P/N 22594 (serd 010037) will be used to gain access to the fan blades. Removal/ replacement of the fan blades and fan exit fairing assembly from the engine will be accomplished using standard hand tools.</p>
<p>A means is required at organizational, intermediate, and depot levels of maintenance to store 18 pairs of fan blades after removal from the engine to prevent damage. The projected width and height of each blade concave airfoil is approximately 6.7 and 8 inches, respectively. The length of the each blade is approximately 27 inches long and weighs about 10 lbs. The means shall allow storage of the fan blade in the vertical position with the tip pointing upward. The means shall also provide separation of each blade.</p>
<p>The means shall fit on the maintenance platform, P/N 22594, while two persons are on the platform. The platform includes an approximately 8 ft wide x 15 ft long deck.</p>
<p>The means shall include lifting rings for hoisting the means including the 18 pairs of blades, and forklift pockets. Hoisting will be accomplished by using a universal multiple leg sling, P/N 17gll0012-1 (serd 110027) in conjunction with a portable floor crane; or a forklift.</p>
<p>This requirement will be a set-aside for small business. Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with mandatory, explicit and detailed instructions contained in the RFQ. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal to be considered by the contracting agency. The government will utilize the past performance information retrieval system (PPIRS), excluded parties list system (EPLS), and other government databases to determine contractor status before evaluating proposals. Proposal will be evaluated based on criteria stated in the RFQ. We anticipated release of the RFQ on or around 10 December 2018 with an estimated response date of 09 January 2019.</p>
<p>The RFQ and all attachments will be posted to the federal business opportunities webpage (http://www.fbo.gov/). If you have questions or concerns related to this acquisition, contact the contracting specialist at email ashley.mcclain.2@us.af.mil; telephone 478-926-7254. All data for this weapon system is considered export controlled.</p>

<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: February 2019: The following drug classes/subclass and newly approved agents will be reviewed:</p>
<p>Antipsychotic Agents - Atypical: Abilify Mycite <br /><br />Antimalarials - NA: Arakoda <br /><br />Anti-Inflammatory Immuno Ophth Agents - Ophth Immuno Agents: Cequa <br /><br />Oncological Agents - Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: Daurismo<br /><br />Hematological Agents - WBC Stimulants: Granix Vial <br /><br />Anti-Inflammatory Immuno Ophth Agents - Ophth Anti-Inflammatory Agents: Inveltys <br /><br />Oncological Agents - Lung Cancer: Lorbrena <br /><br />Anti-Inflammatory Immuno Ophth Agents - NA: Oxervate <br /><br />Metabolic Replacement Agents Miscellaneous - NA: Revcovi <br /><br />Anticonvulsants - Antimania Agents: Sympazan <br /><br />Hematological Agents - WBC Stimulants: Udencya <br /><br />Oncological Agents - NA: Vitrakvi <br /><br />Glaucoma Agents- NA: Xelpros <br /><br />Oncological Agents - Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: Xospata <br /><br />Androgens-Anabolic Steroids - Testosterone Replacement Therapies: Xyosted <br /><br />Pulmonary-2 Agents - Long Acting Muscarinic Antagonists: Yupelri</p>
<p>RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. <br />There is no pre-proposal teleconference. Rather, questions shall be submitted via e-mail to the Request for Quote (RFQ) Point of Contact stated in Part 2.3, no later than the date stated in Part 2.4. Also, responses to Part 3.4 is required.</p>

<p align="left"><br />Evaluation Criteria<br /><br />FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2018)<br /><br />a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factorsconsidered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p align="left">Price____________________________________</p>
<p align="left">Technical Capability________________________</p>
<p align="left">Past Performance___________________________</p>
<p align="left">Technical and past performance, when combined, are Not Applicable. The Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable method will be used.</p>
<p align="left">(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p align="left">(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p align="left">(End of Provision)</p>
<p align="left">The evaluation method that will be utilized is Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Tradeoffs are not permitted. Quotes are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using the non-cost/price factors. The evaluation criteria are as follows: Price, Technical Capability, and Past Performance.</p>
<p align="left">Price</p>
<p align="left">The contractor must submit a single unit price for each line item listed in attachment 2, CLIN Structure, and a total price. The total price will be used to evaluate the lowest priced quote. Complete and submit attachment 2 with your response.</p>
<p align="left">Technical Requirements</p>
<p align="left">The contractor must include part numbers on their quote or provide a separate list of part numbers to determine their quote is technically acceptable (See Attachment 2, CLIN Structure, for product/part numbers). Complete and submit attachment 3, Technical Requirements Compliance Form, with your quote.</p>
<p align="left">Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Past performance will be reviewed in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b) Evaluation procedures.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through

requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />10.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.237-70 CONTRACTOR COMMUNICATIONS <br />(a) A contractor employee shall be identified both by the individual's name and the contractor's name when:<br />1. Included in NOAA's locator, and<br />2. When submitting any type of electronic correspondence to any NOAA employee or stakeholder.<br />(b) Any written correspondence from a contractor or any contractor employee shall be printed on company/organization letterhead or otherwise clearly identify the sender as an employee of the company or organization and shall identify the contract number.<br />(c) Contractors and/or contractor employees shall clearly identify themselves as such in any verbal communications, whether in informal discussion or a formal meeting.</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<br />(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:<br />(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.237-71 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.<br />(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:<br />(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;<br />(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;<br />(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;<br />(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or<br />(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.<br />(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.<br />(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.<br />In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.<br />(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.<br />(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-<br />(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;<br />(2) Forego the work; or<br />(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.<br />(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.<br />(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance. <br />Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.<br />(End of Contract Language)</p>
<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. <br />(a) Definitions. <br />Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. <br />(b) Requirements. <br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. <br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. <br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.<br />Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. <br />Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. <br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. <br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. <br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. <br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. <br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. <br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. <br />For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: <br />&bull; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&bull; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&bull; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&bull; Text: (202) 335-0265 <br />(d) Confidentiality. <br />Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e) Remedies. <br />In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: <br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

IF THERE IS NOT A PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN PPIRS or FAPPIIS, then Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in the solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to their client for previous projects. Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted directly from your client via email to Contract Specialist.

Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.

Basis of Past Performance Evaluation: The Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government (e.g., PPIRS, FAPIIS, eSRS, Past Performance Questionnaires: performance recognition documents and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:
 
a. A pattern of successful completion of task;

b. A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;

c. A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task 
managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc);

d. How recent tasks performed are, that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand, and;

e. A respect for stewardship of Government funds.

3. An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral past performance rating. 

4. Offerors shall provide documentation to show that offeror has no more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past 3 years and has an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.

5. In order to be considered acceptable for this factor the offeror must have received primarily satisfactory or better evaluations for recent and relevant projects and based on the offeror s performance record, the Government must have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror s performance record is unknown. An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

Evaluation Approach

IF THERE IS NOT A PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN PPIRS or FAPPIIS, then Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in the solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to their client for previous projects. Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted directly from your client via email to Contract Specialist.

Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.

Basis of Past Performance Evaluation: The Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government (e.g., PPIRS, FAPIIS, eSRS, Past Performance Questionnaires: performance recognition documents and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:
 
a. A pattern of successful completion of task;

b. A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;

c. A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task 
managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc);

d. How recent tasks performed are, that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand, and;

e. A respect for stewardship of Government funds.

3. An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral past performance rating. 

4. Offerors shall provide documentation to show that offeror has no more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past 3 years and has an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.

5. In order to be considered acceptable for this factor the offeror must have received primarily satisfactory or better evaluations for recent and relevant projects and based on the offeror s performance record, the Government must have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror s performance record is unknown. An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted directly from your client via email to Contract Specialist.

An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

Any costs associated with Reports/Deliverables shall be included in the CLIN price and not separately priced. The Contractor agrees to hold the prices in its quote firm for ninety (90) calendar days from the date specified for receipt of quotes.

IF THERE IS NOT A PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION IN PPIRS or FAPPIIS, then Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in the solicitation is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to their client for previous projects. Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted directly from your client via email to Contract Specialist.

Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.

Basis of Past Performance Evaluation: The Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government (e.g., PPIRS, FAPIIS, eSRS, Past Performance Questionnaires: performance recognition documents and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:
 
a. A pattern of successful completion of task;

b. A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;

c. A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task 
managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc);

d. How recent tasks performed are, that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand, and;

e. A respect for stewardship of Government funds.

3. An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral past performance rating. 

4. Offerors shall provide documentation to show that offeror has no more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past 3 years and has an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.

5. In order to be considered acceptable for this factor the offeror must have received primarily satisfactory or better evaluations for recent and relevant projects and based on the offeror s performance record, the Government must have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror s performance record is unknown. An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

If the offeror is unable to contact a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ (Attachment 3), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.

Basis of Past Performance Evaluation: The Government will evaluate the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government (e.g., PPIRS, FAPIIS, eSRS, Past Performance Questionnaires: performance recognition documents and information obtained from any other source) reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering:
 
a. A pattern of successful completion of task;

b. A pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality;

c. A pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task 
managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc);

d. How recent tasks performed are, that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand, and;

e. A respect for stewardship of Government funds.

3. An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral past performance rating. 

4. Offerors shall provide documentation to show that offeror has no more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past 3 years and has an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.

5. In order to be considered acceptable for this factor the offeror must have received primarily satisfactory or better evaluations for recent and relevant projects and based on the offeror s performance record, the Government must have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror s performance record is unknown. An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

An offer will be considered unacceptable for this factor, if based on the offeror s performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Additionally, the contractor must have no
more than three serious, or one repeat, or one willful OSHA or EPA violation(s) in the past three years; and must have an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of equal to or less than 1.0.
   
Evaluation Approach
A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 
B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 
C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.
D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

This equipment serves at the primary unit for inpatient wards.  Because the unit is 20 years of age, it is constantly in need of repair which slows down patient care.  The new unit will enhance production speed with a unique production-orientated interface, users can pre-plan by easily seeing upcoming system needs such as consumable availability, upcoming trays needed and missing or low-count medications.  The unlimited queue functionality means the system moves from batch to batch with no service interruption.  High volume canisters require fewer, fills, and half-table canister cut pills on-demand, limiting manual operations.
The Contractor is responsible for providing all items listed on the quote and fully installing the equipment, calibrating, testing, and evaluating the equipment after installation to include all other agreements pursuant to the quote and training of on-site staff in use of equipment.
Yearly service agreement: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, supervision and expertise in order to provide maintenance services for the ARXIUM/equipment list within the Statement of Work as required. The VA Medical Center Dallas is a 24 hour/7 day per week operation so the contractor shall always be required to provide maintenance service.

The Contractor shall respond with 24 hours of a maintenance or repair call.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Post-Op Shoes. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Post-Op Shoes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Post-Op Shoes in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Post-Op Shoes will be established approximately April 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately May 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Post-Op Shoes. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Post-Op Shoes.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Post-Op Shoes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $265,697. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fourteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 85.5% ($227,117) of the total volume in sales ($265,697). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to this QSL FBO announcement and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />5.1 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, LARGE / 1,955 /<br />5.2 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, MEDIUM / 1,747 /<br />5.3 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, SMALL / 986 /<br />5.4 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT MALE, LARGE / 3,308 /<br />5.5 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT MALE, MEDIUM / 2,263 /<br />5.6 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT MALE, SMALL / 636 /<br />5.7 POST-OP SHOE, ROUNDED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), SEMI-RIGID FLAT RUBBER SOLE, ADULT MALE, X-LARGE / 404 /<br />5.8 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT MALE, X-LARGE / 436 /<br />5.9 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, LARGE / 798 /<br />5.10 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, MEDIUM / 965 /<br />5.11 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT FEMALE, SMALL / 63 /<br />5.12 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT MALE, LARGE / 1,947 /<br />5.13 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT MALE, MEDIUM / 2,106 /<br />5.14 POST-OP SHOE, SQUARED TOE BOX, OPEN TOE, CLOSED HEEL, HOOK &amp; LOOP SECUREMENT FASTENER(S), RIGID ROCKER SOLE, ADULT MALE, SMALL / 1,314 /<br /><br />6.

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:<br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.<br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.<br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  (SDVOSB Set-Aside) This is a TIME EXTENSION of a previous Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 636-18-302 that requires Architect and/or Engineering (A-E) Design Services to  Demolish Outdated Buildings , VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE SUBMITTED SF-330s. The contemplated A-E Services that are anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6, and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6.

DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this project is to develop construction documents that will be used to demolish buildings 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, Mod C, and Mod D on the VA-Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System   Omaha campus.  Demolishing these buildings will allow for the expansion of several services.  The construction plans shall be phased so each building can be demolished independently, i.e., each building will be a separate line item.  Major elements of work include:  Survey, construction documents, and utility coordination.  It is anticipated that most or all investigative work will be conducted outside of normal business hours (8:00 AM to 4:30 PM) and on weekends.  The intent is to minimize the disruption to patient care related activities.  A//E shall locate all utilities in the vicinity of buildings to be demolished.  As-built drawings may be available for reference, but shall not be the sole means of determining utility locations. 

All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73, the total cost of the contract for A-E services must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-22 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated A-E firm selected to complete the design.

Interested firms should submit one paper copy and one CD copy of their current SF-330 to: Nebraska-Western Iowa HCS, Omaha VA Medical Center, ATTN:  Sharon Spohn (90C), 4101 Woolworth Avenue, Omaha, NE 68105-1850.  The SF-330s are due on December 20, 2018 at 2:00 PM (CST).  Use the instructions located in section fourteen (14) below for submitting your SF-330.

NO FAX OR EMAIL RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED:  Personal visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be entertained or scheduled.  Selection shall be in order of preference from the firms considered Most Highly Qualified.  Questions may be directed only by e-mail to Sharon.Spohn@va.gov.

In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A-E Firms and 36.606 (c), all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers is outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Please note the  portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take regarding unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as  unreadable  pursuant to FAR Part and FAR 15.207(c ). 

Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $2,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  
Contract Award Procedure: At time of award, the contractor must be certified by VetBiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov. Failure of an SDVOSB to be VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE in VetBiz shall result in elimination from consideration as a potential contract awardee. Failure of a SDVOSB to be registered in SAM at the time of contract award shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contract awardee. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 

The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.

The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.

The awarded A-E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A-E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A-E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.

<p>Obtaining the solicitation: The solicitation will be issued unrestricted to allow U.S. and non-U.S. firms to participate. The solicitation and any technical exhibits (when applicable), which will include sketches and specifications, will be available for download from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov. All notifications of changes to the solicitation will be made through electronics means only. It is anticipated that the official Request for Quote (RFQ) for this procurement will be released on or about 20 December, 2018. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a purchase order, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any quotation preparation costs. It is the quoter's responsibility to check for any posted changes to the solicitation. Vendors are encouraged to pay close attention to instructions outlined in the solicitation and pre-solicitation notice.</p>
<p>FBO/SAM Registration: Potential offerors MUST register at https://www.fbo.gov in order to receive automatic notifications and/or changes to the solicitation. The System for Award Management (SAM) is the official U.S. Government system that consolidated the capabilities of CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. Registration in SAM is required for a contractor to receive contract award. There is NO fee to register on this website.</p>
<p>Immediate Changes in the SAM registration process: The General Services Administration (GSA) has launched a new security measure (effective immediately) in the System for Award Management (SAM) which requires that every *NEW* or existing contractor registrant submits an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Date Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number before the registration will be activated. The notarized letter requirement is mandatory for all types of registrants, US-based or foreign. It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and proactively maintain their SAM registration in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration. More information can be found at https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/office-of-systems-management/integrated-award-environment-iae/sam-update</p>
<p>Recommend all offerors immediately check their expiration date of SAM registration. See the ALERT notice on the SAM home page for FAQ instructions on how to submit the notarized letter.</p>
<p>Construction Time: Estimated construction time is 180 calendar days from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>
<p>Type of Set-Aside: The applicable NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. This requirement will be solicited unrestricted to obtain full and open competition.</p>
<p>Contract Type: The Government intends to award a single, firm fixed-price purchase order, for the construction of the warehouse described above.</p>
<p>Contemplating Awardees: Since the contemplated purchase order is to be awarded by the contracting activity located at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, USA and to be performed in El Salvador, the offerors must meet the following two requirements when contract performance will be wholly or in part performed in a foreign country:</p>
<p>(1) DFARS 252.225-7042, "Authorization to Perform" - The Offeror has been duly authorized to operate and to do business in the country or countries in which the contract is to be performed; and,(2) FAR 52.236-7, "Permits and Responsibilities" - The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any host government and political subdivisions laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work. Contractor shall provide copy of its certifications and permits with its proposal.</p>
<p>Contract Award Evaluation Criteria: The Government will award a purchase order resulting from the solicitation to the responsible Quoter, whose quote conforms to the solicitation, and represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote.</p>
<p>Anticipated Award Date: The anticipated award date for this effort is on or about 15 December, 2018.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this notice MUST be submitted by electronic mail to the Contract Specialist at shasheshe.l.goolsby.mil@mail.mil AND a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer at hubert.m.cacho.civ@mail.mil. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

20180615:  Amendment 0001 is issued to revise Attachment 5 - Past Performance Survey. Due date for receipt of proposals remains July 11, 2018.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for a Technically Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (TAGARS).  All work shall be accomplished in accordance to the Statement of Work.

The Technically Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (TAGARS) is part of the Aerospace Medical Equipment Needs (AMEN) Phase II acquisition program, which was established to continue to provide urgent upgrades to the aging and obsolete research laboratory equipment of the two CAMI research divisions.  The AMEN 2 program is a continuation of AMEN 1.  AMEN 1, a non-NAS Technology Refreshment (TR) effort, Acquisition Category level 5 (ACAT-5), approved on 24 May 2010, was established to replace research laboratory equipment at CAMI.  AMEN 2, a non-NAS Information Technology (IT) acquisition effort, was approved by the Acquisition Executive Board (AEB) as a TR ACAT-5, on 11 June 2013.  It was later designated to be a Variable Quantity (VQ) ACAT-5 effort on 30 April 2014 and tailored to move directly to the Final Investment Decision (FID) of the Acquisition Management System (AMS) process, scheduled to occur on 16 September 2015.  The AMEN 2 program requirements are presented in the AMEN 2 final Program Requirements Document (fPRD).

The TAGARS supports the laboratories in the Division, which focus on improving human performance through enhanced equipment design, interface design, agency workforce optimization, investigations of work environment issues, and organizational effectiveness.  This work is conducted by the Flight Deck Human Research Laboratory (FDHFRL, AAM-510) and the NAS Human Factors Safety Research Laboratory (NASHFSRL, AAM-520).

The AHFRD is replacing the Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS), and older single-engine reciprocating (piston) engine research simulator with a new high-fidelity flight simulator for the purpose of continuing advanced general aviation research in established areas and expanding into others of technically advanced cockpit designs that could not properly supported with our existing simulator, but could not be supported by a current-generation simulation device.

The AHFRD has a requirement to update the technology of its aviation simulator infrastructure.  The technical update includes hardware and software acquisition, installation and training with follow-on annual maintenance of the software components in support of the TAGARS system.  
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) 6973GH-18-R-00113 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  
This procurement is not a set-aside.   The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 1,000 employees.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (July 11, 2018).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), “if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.”

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, stephanie.riddle@faa.gov, no later than 3:00 p.m. CT, July 11, 2018.  

Offerors submitting proposals by hand-delivery will need to consider allowing sufficient time to process through the security procedures in place at MMAC.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO may also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for the special mail-handling procedures in place at MMAC.

In accordance with SIR Section L provision 3.2.2.3-14 entitled, "Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals," any proposals received after the due time and date of 3:00 p.m. CT, July 11, 2018, will not be considered.  In addition, if all requested information is not furnished in the offeror's proposal, the offeror's proposal may be determined to be non-responsive and ineligible for consideration for contract award.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

Any questions or concerns pertaining to this SIR or the requirement within should be sent in writing to the contracting officer at Stephanie.riddle@faa.gov.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for a Technically Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (TAGARS).  All work shall be accomplished in accordance to the Statement of Work.

The Technically Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (TAGARS) is part of the Aerospace Medical Equipment Needs (AMEN) Phase II acquisition program, which was established to continue to provide urgent upgrades to the aging and obsolete research laboratory equipment of the two CAMI research divisions.  The AMEN 2 program is a continuation of AMEN 1.  AMEN 1, a non-NAS Technology Refreshment (TR) effort, Acquisition Category level 5 (ACAT-5), approved on 24 May 2010, was established to replace research laboratory equipment at CAMI.  AMEN 2, a non-NAS Information Technology (IT) acquisition effort, was approved by the Acquisition Executive Board (AEB) as a TR ACAT-5, on 11 June 2013.  It was later designated to be a Variable Quantity (VQ) ACAT-5 effort on 30 April 2014 and tailored to move directly to the Final Investment Decision (FID) of the Acquisition Management System (AMS) process, scheduled to occur on 16 September 2015.  The AMEN 2 program requirements are presented in the AMEN 2 final Program Requirements Document (fPRD).

The TAGARS supports the laboratories in the Division, which focus on improving human performance through enhanced equipment design, interface design, agency workforce optimization, investigations of work environment issues, and organizational effectiveness.  This work is conducted by the Flight Deck Human Research Laboratory (FDHFRL, AAM-510) and the NAS Human Factors Safety Research Laboratory (NASHFSRL, AAM-520).

The AHFRD is replacing the Advanced General Aviation Research Simulator (AGARS), and older single-engine reciprocating (piston) engine research simulator with a new high-fidelity flight simulator for the purpose of continuing advanced general aviation research in established areas and expanding into others of technically advanced cockpit designs that could not properly supported with our existing simulator, but could not be supported by a current-generation simulation device.

The AHFRD has a requirement to update the technology of its aviation simulator infrastructure.  The technical update includes hardware and software acquisition, installation and training with follow-on annual maintenance of the software components in support of the TAGARS system.  
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) 6973GH-18-R-00113 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  
This procurement is not a set-aside.   The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 333318, Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 1,000 employees.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (July 11, 2018).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), “if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.”

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, stephanie.riddle@faa.gov, no later than 3:00 p.m. CT, July 11, 2018.  

Offerors submitting proposals by hand-delivery will need to consider allowing sufficient time to process through the security procedures in place at MMAC.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO may also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for the special mail-handling procedures in place at MMAC.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of market research to explore the ability of industry to meet the Laser Optical Near-Earth Satellite System (LOCNESS) payload switch requirements. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.
<div><br />The LOCNESS Project within the Human Exploration and Operation (HEO) Mission Directorate and Space, Communications and Navigation (SCaN) is responsible to design and build the first satellite of an optical space communications network to enhance the existing RF network. NASA is currently planning for a geosynchronous-orbiting optical communications relay node with a 2025 commissioning. This optical communications relay node will serve as an initial element of an optical relay constellation to supplement the TDRSS fleet. It will support high-rate communications with users from the earth's surface, LEO, MEO, GEO, Cislunar and Earth-Sun L1/L2 distances, as well as optical crosslinks between nodes to minimize ground station constraints.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The optical communications network concept consists of a three relay satellite system to provide global coverage. The GSFC LOCNESS Project is charged with building an operational Optical Relay including the spacecraft and Payload. The Optical Relay consists of the Optical Communications Payload (OCP) (with a Ka-band system) and the Spacecraft (Bus) to provide user relay services. The OCP consists of four (4) Optical Relay Terminals (ORT) and the Payload Electronics (PE).  Each ORT consists of the: Optical Module (OM), Controller Electronics, Modems (10 and 100 Gbps), HPOA, and a fiber coupler. The Payload Electronics consists of the: Payload Controller, Switch, PSIM, DTN Router and Data Storage.</div>
<div><br />NASA is soliciting responses from interested parties in regard to vendor capability and interest related to only the switch capability and functionality within the Optical Communication Payload. NASA is seeking capabilities from both large and small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and small business subcontracting goals for this requirement. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The complete draft statement of intent for the LOCNESS switch is hereby provided as a point of reference. This document is for information and planning purposes only and is to allow industry the opportunity to submit responses describing their relevant capabilities for the LOCNESS Switch requirement.  As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</div>
<div><br />Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: (1) Addressing all of the functional areas outlined in the attached draft LOCNESS Switch Statement of Intent and (2) summarizing relevant past experience.</div>
<div><br />The statement of capability shall be UNCLASSIFIED. Companies also must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (www.sam.gov) to be considered as potential sources. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Your responses will not be returned nor will respondents be notified of the results of the evaluation. The information obtained from industry responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and a future RFP (if applicable). No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</div>
<div><br />All written documents shall be in Microsoft Word and shall be no more than 25 pages (8.5"x 11", using not smaller than 12 point Arial font) in length.  A one-page summary shall be included with the capability statement(s), which identifies the company's specific capabilities that are relevant to the requirement. In addition, the summary should also include the following: Name and address of company, average annual revenue for past 3 years, number of employees, type of business ownership (i.e., Large Business, Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) Business, HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, and Veteran-Owned Small Business), affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime), and location of the business. The one page summary page will not count against the maximum page limit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Submit any questions to: Kendall Mauldin (Code 450.2) at kendall.d.mauldin@nasa.gov</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The deadline to respond to this RFI is Friday, December 14, 2018, 11:59 PM EST.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statement of Intent:</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Laser Optical Near-Earth Satellite System (LOCNESS) Project Office to survey industry on the capabilities of existing high speed switch designs that could meet the requirements for the LOCNESS optical relay satellite.</p>
<p><br />This Industry Survey Data Package includes the key assumptions, requirements and a functional diagram. The key study parameter is, "Can your organization build, integrate and test a space based switch that meets the below stated assumptions and requirements?" Second, what are the predicted power and mass estimates, for power provide start of mission, end of mission 5 years and end of mission 8 years (goal).</p>
<p><br />Basic Concept of Operations Scenario for Optical Communications Earth Relay: <br />&bull;	LOCNESS Optical Relay Node has four optical modules with modems capable of &lt;10 Gbps (User data) or &lt;100 Gbps (Backhaul/Trunk) and a Ka-Band sub-system capable of &lt;6 Gbps.<br />1.	Data comes in on Optical Modules at  &lt;10 Gbps or 100 Gbps depending on modem type being used<br />a.	Each optical signal is demodulated and decoded at the modem (10Gbps or 100Gbps)<br />b.	Frames (Link Layer) are sent through the switch<br />c.	Frames are multiplexed in the switch (the &lt; 100Gbps can be an aggregation of multiple &lt;10Gbps user streams Multiplexed)<br />d.	Frames sent to a modem (&lt;10 Gbps or &lt;100Gbps)<br />e.	Modem encodes, modulates and transmits at appropriate optical link rate<br />&bull;	&lt;10 Gbps from User-to-Relay, &lt;100 Gbps Relay-to-Relay, and &lt;100 Gbps Relay-to-Ground<br />&bull;	Worst case is two 100 Gbps Relay-to-Relay, one 100 Gbps User-to-Relay and one 100 Gbps Relay-to-Ground</p>
<p>Mission level assumptions provided for context:<br />&bull;	The LOCNESS Optical Relay Node will operate in a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)<br />&bull;	The LOCNESS Optical Relay Node will operate 5 Years at GEO (required), 8 year goal <br />&bull;	The LOCNESS Optical Relay Node will be a level 1 EEE parts program (EEE Parts, TELCORDIA parts, up screened commercial parts where appropriate, or some combination)<br />&bull;	Optical Relay Terminals configuration will be identical &amp; functionally interchangeable<br />&bull;	All four relay terminals can be operated simultaneously with any combination of data rates &amp; controlled independently of one other</p>
<p>High Speed Switch<br />&bull;	Managed Switch Application<br />o	The switch shall be reconfigurable for switching by command or table upload<br />o	The switch shall be autonomous after configuration/re-configure<br />o	The switch shall include a Management Interface for monitoring / control<br />&bull;	Performance<br />o	The switch shall have at least 410 Gbps aggregate switch capacity (non-blocking) (throughput; effective User/Data throughput rate (not baud rate))<br />&bull;	Functional<br />o	The switch shall forward frames based on header or other meta data AND<br />o	The switch shall forward frames based on managed look-up table (routing table)<br />o	The switch shall allow loopback at any given port for testing purposes<br />o	The switch shall have a broadcast mode from one to all other ports<br />&bull;	Interfaces<br />o	The Physical Interfaces will be fiber or copper (TBR) (Open trade; Considerations for current implementations (Between modem and switch))<br />&bull;	Overhead<br />o	The switch will assume there are no requirements for FEC processing or fill processing (all handled in modems)<br />&bull;	Questions<br />1.	Are there any current, or planned, capabilities above 100 Gbps?<br />2.	Do you have a low cost solution using commercial vendors packaged for space?<br />3.	What is/are your Link Layer protocol(s)?<br />4.	What Interoperable commercial standards are currently implemented?<br />5.	Identify any components that are space qualified, and in the process to be space qualified?<br />6.	Identify any components that are space qualified or in the process to be space qualified.<br />7.	 Are there any QoS capabilities implemented in your product lines? If so, what capabilities?</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Park Service, Santa Fe Major Acquisition Buying Office intends to award a contract for radio tower rental at the Port Mansfield Channel located in Port Mansfield, TX for Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS).  This contract will be issued with One (1) Base year and Four (4) Option years.  Padre Island National Seashore is located in a remote area in the State of Texas.  Because of this, PAIS have major smuggling routes running through the Park.  This makes communications systems a critical life and safety issue for NPS/PAIS law enforcement personnel and park personnel.  In many of these areas, the park¿s radio system is the only communication system that provides coverage in the park.  The need is for a provider with experience and knowledge of providing radio tower capability in the Corpus Christi, TX area.  American Tower Corporation is the only known radio tower company close enough to North Padre Island to provide the radio communication service that is necessary for all communications in the park.  For these reasons, the selection of this vendor should save the government both time and monies in obtaining the necessary services.   The proposed contract action covers supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals; however this notice of intent is not a request for 
competitive proposals.  Inquiries and proposals received with ten (10 days) after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  
Authority for this award is 10 U.S.C. 2304©(1), FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) Only one Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements and 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency.  The sole source justification for this award will be provided upon request.  If you have specific questions or require clarification of this notice, please contact Pollard Mobley, Contract Specialist at 409-790-0799 or email at pollard_mobley@nps.gov.

Government Response:
The coordinates were field testing, many at areas that there are no addresses to give.  The best the Government could possibly do is provide zip codes as the VA does not have addresses at those coordinates.  Those are community locations that staff frequent. 

If you could take a moment and summarize what your envisioning to see surrounding  A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) 
Would this be high-level pricing summary
Government Response: Yes, the Government is looking for high-level pricing based on the breakout of the quantities listed in answer 1.

JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                          Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics 
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
         Eatontown, New Jersey 07724           
    
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), for brand name Splunk perpetual software licenses and software maintenance.
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  VA, Office of Information and Technology, Cybersecurity Operations Center (VA CSOC) has a requirement for one brand name Splunk perpetual software license and associated maintenance support.  Additionally, maintenance support is required for four existing VA-owned Splunk perpetual licenses and an additional Splunk perpetual software license with associated software maintenance support will be purchased in each option period.  VA CSOC manages, protects, and monitors the cyber and security posture of the VA and currently uses Splunk to perform Security and Compliance analyses along with Infrastructure and Operations Management.  Splunk is the engine for machine data generated by VA information technology (IT) systems within physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructures, and provides a means to capture data generated by VA s IT infrastructure.  Splunk s log management tool provides VA CSOC s security and analysis teams with a definitive record of all user transactions, customer behavior, machine behavior, security threats, fraudulent activity and other activity in the raw data form that can be stored indefinitely.  VA CSOC uses this data to provide rapid incident response, correlation, and in-depth monitoring across all data sources, monitor equipment uptime, and rapidly pinpoint and resolve problems with security and performance.  The period of performance is 12 months from date of contract award with two 12-month option periods.  The total estimated price of the proposed action, inclusive of all options, is $
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The specific authority for providing for brand name award is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(a)(4) entitled,  An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer. A brand-name item, even if available on more than one contract, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in Section 8 of this justification, it has been determined that limited competition is available for these brand name items and services.  VA CSOC currently has a Splunk log management tool in place.  Due to the growth and expansion of VA s network, VA CSOC is planning for future capacity by expanding on the current Splunk architecture.  VA utilizes Splunk to triage and investigate potential cybersecurity incidents.  With 13 months worth of VA Enterprise Network log retention, Splunk provided VA not only a very granular view of specific events under investigation but also a historical look for similar or related activity.  The aggregation of data from appliances throughout the security stack expedites and enhances investigations by providing a single platform for archive collection and searching.  Loss or replacement of Splunk will result in significant impact as a key tool for Trusted Internet Connection security compliance and enforcement to protect the internal VA applications, users, and assets             from malicious external sources.   

Splunk software is a proprietary software product and no other log management software is capable of integrating with the existing Splunk log management tool.  Specifically, if another product is utilized, it will not communicate with the existing infrastructure due to these proprietary constraints.  For this reason, any other brand name software would require a complete redesign, reengineering, and redevelopment of the existing infrastructure which could take up to a year.  VA intends to continue using the VA owned Splunk licensing, therefore the procurement of another log management solution would result in having two independent solutions operating in parallel which is unnecessary and unacceptable and would result in duplicated costs of millions of dollars on top of the already in production Splunk software.  Specifically, VA CSOC currently has 5 Splunk licenses (1  ES  (Enterprise Security) and 4  Enterprise ). If another brand name software was used, it would result in replacing this entire infrastructure which would result in duplicated costs of $17.5M. This is based on previous efforts to create the infrastructure.  Without there being a comparable alternative solution in the marketplace, replacing the current Splunk infrastructure would result in extensive delivery delays, reduction in critical functionality, and extensive duplication of costs that would not be recovered through competition.

Furthermore, Splunk software has already been deployed and tested in VA s environment, and meets all of VA s requirements.  The necessary Splunk maintenance support will require access to, and use of, both Splunk proprietary code and its Intellectual Property to ensure providing functional patches and upgrades and continued functionality of the software.  No other source can provide the required maintenance support inclusive of software patches, updates, as well as technical support.  Splunk owns the proprietary Intellectual Property rights to the enterprise software and only Splunk or a Splunk reseller has the required access to the source code and other proprietary data of the software in order to meet the Government s needs. Access to this code is also needed to ensure all services provided are properly configured. Failure to acquire this software will result in security events missed allowing possible data loss, data exfiltration, security breaches or system outages to occur. This could lead to VA not meeting Office of Management and Budget Trusted Internet Connection requirements and also hinder the effectiveness of conducting investigations by the VA CSOC, United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team and Office of Inspector General.


6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this justification.  Limited competition amongst Splunk resellers is anticipated for this brand name acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), award of the resultant delivery order will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), the justification will be posted with the request for quote on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website with the solicitation to notify all interested parties. 

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any new products or maintenance services available in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be fully competed.

8.  Market Research:  In August 2018, VA conducted market research to determine if there were viable products from other manufacturers besides Splunk to meet VA s requirements.  Similar products from Trustwave SIEM Operations Addition, Advanced Analytics, Nagios, LogRhythm and Tenable were analyzed and reviewed.  Based on this analysis, the Government s technical experts determined that none of the software solutions offered by these companies could meet VA s requirements as outlined in Section 5 of this justification.  It was determined that none of these products can integrate into VA s current Splunk architecture.  Based on this market research, the Government s technical experts determined that only brand name Splunk software and associated software maintenance support can meet all of VA s requirements.

In September 2018, the Contract Specialist conducted market research to ascertain the extent of limited competition among resellers of the required software licenses and associated software maintenance.  Through the use of the Provider Look-up tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website, 12 Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses  were identified as resellers of the required Splunk Software licenses and software maintenance support.  Therefore, limited competition is anticipated.

9.  Other Facts: None. 

















10.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

      Date: ______________________

Contracting Officer Representative Signature: _________________

11.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on anticipated limited competition.  Additionally, NASA SEWP V has already determined the prices on contract to be fair and reasonable and more competitive pricing may result from competition.  Finally, the successful quote will be compared with the Independent Government Cost Estimate.

<DESC>This J&amp;A contains Controlled Unclassified Information and is therefore attached as a secure document.  Contractors must be certified through Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) in order to access CUI.  See the DLIS website for registration details at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.
<p>As required by FAR 6.305 this J&amp;A is hereby posted for the aforementioned contract award.</p>
<p>Going forward, all new entities registering in GSA's System for Award Management (SAM), as well as existing registrations being updated or renewed, will require the submission of an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  Effective June 11, 2018, entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov to apply only for federal assistance opportunities such as grants, loans, and other financial assistance programs, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  Additionally, Effective June 29, 2018, all non-Federal entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and are proactive in maintaining the SAM registrations in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration.  More information can be found at www.gsa.gov/samupdate.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS
<div><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS or a solicitation or request for offers. This is a notice of an agency's intent to award a contract on a non-competitive basis under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</div>
<div><br />The United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Avue Technologies Corporation for a software as a service (SaaS) subscription to Avue's web-based human capital management (HCM) application.  The services of this provider are necessary to satisfy the agency's need for a fully integrated web-based application that - within the agency's required implementation timeline of 60 to 90 days - will provide the agency with cloud-based human capital management capabilities, such as classification of position descriptions, time and attendance, payroll processing, performance management, recruiting and applicant tracking, paperless onboarding, learning management and data analytics among a host of other HR capabilities necessary to support the agency's integrated workforce, which consists of civil service federal employees, contractor personnel and personal services contractors.</div>
<div><br />The USAGM learned recently that its current HR enterprise personnel system, DCPDS, was being discontinued as the result of the Department of Defense's migration to Oracle's cloud-based Software/Platform as a Service solution. DCPDS informed the agency that it has until summer of 2019 to have a replacement solution in place that is fully implemented and operable. The notice provided the agency with less than 12-months to identify, procure and fully implement a replacement HCM solution that is capable of supporting the entire agency employee population, including its contractors and personal services contractors.<br />After conducting extensive market research and in-depth discussion with potential sources, the agency determined that only Avue is capable of meeting the agency's needs with respect to its required implementation timeline; the application's ability to support an integrated workforce, which includes personal service contractors; and with respect to the application's cyber security certifications. Avue is the only cloud-based HR platform that the agency knows of that is fully FedRAMPed. Avue is also HR LOB certified.</div>
<div><br />During its market research, the agency considered solutions from the following sources:
<p>&bull;	General Services Administration - Federal HR Line of Business (HRLOB) <br />&bull;	Accenture Federal Services - Commercial HRLOB <br />&bull;	International Business Machines (IBM) - Commercial HRLOB <br />&bull;	Oracle - Commercial Vendor - Non-HRLOB<br />&bull;	Department of State - Federal Partner<br />&bull;	Department of Interior (IBC) - Federal HRLOB<br />&bull;	Department of Treasury - Federal HRLOB<br />&bull;	Department of Agriculture<br />&bull;	Avue Digital Services - Carahsoft Commercial HRLOB</p>
<p>A determination not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency; however, any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. The agency will not publicize a written solicitation. Interested parties desiring to submit a capability statement may submit one by e-mail to Fermaint Rios at frios@usagm.gov no later than 12:00 PM (EST), Wednesday, December 12, 2018. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
