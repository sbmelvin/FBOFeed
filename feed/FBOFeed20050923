<DESC>Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agency of the Federal Government, shall furnish personnel, material, facilities and equipment necessary to assess neurocognitive, neuroendocrine, proteomic and genomic biomakers and disease pathways that underlie chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  Because patients come from Georgia, the study must be conducted in Georgia.  Emory University Hospital is the only hospital in Georgia that has a dedicated general clinical research Center (GCRC) with staff experienced in, and facilities appropriate to, evaluation of the neuroendocrinology, cognitive function, stress responses and fMRI of persons with CFS.  A new contractor would have to establish dedicated GCRC facilities with appropriate state of the art research fMRI in Atlanta and hire and train new support staff to evaluate study subjects.  Emory University Principal Investigators have developed the clinical assessment of subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome and other fatiguing illnesses in Georgia protocol in collaboration with CDC CFS Research Program staff.  Consequently, it is believed that Emory University School of Medicine, Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the requirements of this solicitation for the reasons described above.  It is the intent of CDC to award a contract with Emory University School of Medicine if this is found to be true.  The NAICS code is 622110.

<DESC>Contractor will provide a mechanism for providing technical support services related to infectious diseases.  Contractor will provide expert advice and guidance on matters related to sciences and technology.  The various evaluations and analyses undertaken by the contractor will require information gathering, analysis, and dissemination of results that can then be used by CDC.  Contractor will provide technical support services related to assessment and analysis of issues regarding infectious diseases.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the only known organization that traditionally has convened the nation’s foremost scientists to deliberate and report on issues relevant to science and public policy.  The nature and purpose of the NAS make it uniquely able to conduct the work and scope of this contract.  In view of the intense public and political interest focused on these complex studies and technical services, it is imperative that a highly respected and unbiased organization, with its interest being totally related to the public health, be awarded this contract.  Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-5 states that full and open competition need not be provided for when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through agency or from a specified source.  Listed as an example of this is the National Academy of Sciences.  In FAR 6.302-5 (a)(2)(b)(B) full and open competition need not be provided for any contract requiring the National Academy of Sciences to investigate examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or act of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.  Consequently, for the above mentioned reasons, it is believed that NAS is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the above mentioned requirements of CDC.  It is the intent of CDC to award a contract with NAS if this is found to be true.  The NAICS code is 621511.

Terminal Handling Services at Boston Logan Airport (BOS)

The US Postal Service currently tenders mail received from its processing and distribution plants to air carriers at BOS for subsequent air transportation service.  It also receives mail from air carriers at BOS for transfer to surface transportation to receiving postal plants.  These functions are currently performed at a Postal Service facility called the Boston AMC.

The USPS will be vacating the Boston AMC soon.  A Postal Service operated replacement facility is not anticipated, therefore, USPS is seeking to quickly form a Terminal Handling Services agreement to insure the continued flow of the US Mail into and out of Boston Logan Airport.

The Postal Service is opening discussions that may lead to the formation of an agreement with firms who are known to either currently perform such work at Boston, or who have affirmatively expressed interest in the recent past.  The supplier will have to provide an air cargo oriented terminal facility at or very close to Logan Airport of sufficient size to accommodate mail transfer operations.  Facility must also have truck docks.  Bar Code scanning, specific physical security requirements, and personnel screening are also important requirements.  Services must be fully operational not later than December 31, 2005, including a phase in of operations beginning in November, 2005.

The Postal Service believes that its market research has already identified a sufficient number of firms to provide for adequate competition; however, if you are currently performing air cargo terminal service at BOS, you must, within 3 days of posting of this notice, request a copy of Solicitation Number 5AAIMT-05-A-3008, by emailing the Contracting Officer at:  susan.e.partridge@usps.gov, with a fax copy to: 202-268-7919.

Commitment to participate with other ISIS contractors as described in Section III, Eligibility Information, paragraph 2. 4. Relevance of intermediate milestones (Go/No-Go's); and 5.

Also, consideration will be given to the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals.  Individual proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. 

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate and Sensors Directorate have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

3.  The Government intends to use employees from non-Government sources (MITRE, Booz Allen and Hamilton, and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)) to assist as technical experts, in the evaluation of the proposals. Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign non-disclosure agreements in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Should anyone not wish to have his/her proposal viewed by individuals from one of these organizations, they must include a statement to that effect in the cover letter.  Otherwise, by submission of the proposal, you agree that your proposal information may be disclosed to those employees of the organizations identified above for the limited purpose stated above. Only Government evaluators, however, will make award recommendations under this BAA.  Advisors will assist in the evaluation and provide input regarding the strengths, weaknesses, proposal inadequacies, risks, and deficiencies in proposals. They will not determine ratings or rankings of offerors' proposals.  Access to offeror proposals will be restricted to only those portions for which the advisor's expertise is required in the evaluation. 


VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  N/A

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

3. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require an SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

4.  In accordance with DFAR 227.7103, Offerors are required to complete the attached "Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions" with their proposal.

5.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Utah, under contract number N01-NS-4-2359 new requirements to the existing Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) Statement of Work.  These new requirements are for screening compounds for therapeutic activity against convulsions and seizures caused by acute exposure to organophosphorus nerve agent chemical weapons and cyanide. In addition, there will be new requirements to screen compounds for activity against the neurodegeneration associated with acute exposures to these chemicals.  The existing ASP contract routinely conducts an extensive drug discovery and translational science effort aimed at identifying new therapies for advanced development and eventual marketing to treat human epilepsy disorders and modulation of axonal neurotransmission.  Promising compounds are tested through a series of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic evaluations (both in vivo and in vitro screening) that help define a candidate’s anticonvulsant profile including activity, neurotoxicity, and effect on hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes, drug resistance and pharmacodynamic interactions.  These efforts have been carried out under the contract mechanism since 1975 with the University of Utah.  Approximately 800 compounds are evaluated for therapeutic usefulness each year.  Overall testing requirements in the existing ASP include, but are not limited to, anticonvulsant identification, associated neurotoxicity, anticonvulsant quantitation including establishment of effective doses for a panel of relevant tests, pharmacologic differentiation from prototype drugs, evaluation of proconvulsant potential, studies directed toward elucidating anticonvulsant mechanism(s) of action, drug interaction studies, mutagenicity tests, drug resistance and a variety of other standardized tests to determine relevant activity in candidate compounds.  During the past 30 years, the University of Utah has been able to successfully adopt specialized techniques, methods of evaluation and accumulation of extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles for all the current therapeutic agents and new investigational drugs.  This accumulation of data and experiences is the basis by which all new test compounds are pharmacologically compared. This new work will include in vitro screens and animal models to test a candidate drug’s potential therapeutic value against convulsions and seizures caused by exposure to nerve agents and/or cyanide. Requirements will include the development, validation, and use of models that utilize relevant exposure scenarios to chemical agents, or models that simulate such exposures.  Examples of models that may simulate nerve agent-induced seizures include the pilocarpine - and kainite-induced epilepsy models.   Requirements will also include the testing of new or existing candidate neuroprotectant compounds for efficacy against neurodegeneration and neuronal/glial damage caused by exposure to chemical threat agents.  For example, neurodegeneration may be assessed via quantitative stereological analysis and the relationship between seizure activity and neuronal damage.  Finally, the new work will include the development of specialized in vivo and/or in vitro models to assess the effectiveness of candidate therapies, e.g. pediatric pharmacotherapy models, drug interactions, for use with pre-existing medical conditions, and efficacy in the elderly.  The ultimate goal of these programs will be to develop new therapies that are fast acting (<10 min), have intermediate duration of action, i.e., effective for a few hours or more, have minimal respiratory depressant effect, can be delivered through non-IV route (IM, IN) appropriate for field conditions, are suitable for a wide demographic range, are stable at room temperature, and can be administered in combination with other appropriate therapies. The NINDS believes that the University of Utah is the only known source for performing comprehensive evaluations by virtue of their 30 years of experience, demonstrated expertise, availability of required staff, laboratory and animal facilities, other requisite resources already in existence within the core program, and validated control data on numerous marketed therapies. NINDS' requirement for consistency and compatibility of data derived from these screening procedures is paramount to the success of this program. For the 30 years of the ongoing anticonvulsant screening work performed by the University of Utah, the NINDS is not aware of or doesn’t believe that any other organization possesses the capability or has developed a comparable database upon which work for the new screening objectives will be based exists.  Inability to produce compatible evaluation results to our existing data base would lead to delays in screening new compounds and incurrence of duplicate costs, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government.  A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 ©(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302 .  The University of Utah is considered the only source capable of performing the additional screening analyses and has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V214125264AY08; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS George Washington (CVN-73) the following items: 0001 – Provide and Install Cosmetic Polymeric (Monolithic Seamless) Deck Covering – Type III:  Existing deck covering will be removed down to bare metal surface by SHIP’S FORCE.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with GENSPEC Section 631.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new cosmetic polymeric (monolithic seamless) deck covering material throughout entire areas specified IAW military specification Mil Spec MIL-D-24613 Type III.  Installation of new deck covering material shall be in accordance with manufacturers specifications and detailed requirements stated in GENSPEC Section 634.  Cove base effect shall be IAW manufacturers instructions or as directed by GENSPEC 634, which ever is greater.  Apply two coats of sealer IAW manufacturers specifications to complete the installation and promote durability.  Color and pattern of new deck covering material shall be specified by ships representative.  Contractor shall maintain completion log in order to track contract ‘ceiling’ of specified square footage.

1. The area of decking measures approximately 23,000 SF.
2. The 23,000 SF does NOT include ‘underlayment’ + ‘Type III’.  This approach would only produce a total Type III coverage of 11,500 SF. The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and Type III so that final project completion shall result in 23,000 SF of Type III installed.
3. The list of spaces spreadsheet shall be considered an estimate only. Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship’s designated representative(s).
4. Offerors shall quote a firm fixed price for labor, materials, and installation for removal and installation of 23,000 SF. The log tracking system established by the contractor and certified by the ship’s designated representative (identified at pre-work planning conference) shall serve to verify the scope of work, in this case NTE 23,000 SF
5.  Contractors shall assume all existing stratic decking system was installed using PPI installation instructions per NAVSEA directive.

Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 31 MAR 2006.  FOB Point Destination Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard for 25% of the work effort and Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk for remaining 75% of work effort.  Contractor shall adhere to all requirements and regulations of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the USS George Washington CVN-73 and the Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard. 
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1) Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance. (a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. (c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action. Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA). Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA). Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A). High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).Neutral: No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided. The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price: The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11). The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: a) Price comparison with other offerors; b) Completeness: All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and c) Comparison with independent Government estimates. Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award. 3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation. (b) Options. N/A. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Required Central Contractor Registration, (a) Definitions. As used in this clause  (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number, means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database, means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete.

Contractor geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches.  The program will consist of two phases: Phase 1 will cover a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation, risk reduction experiments, a “compelling” sub-scale laboratory breadboard demonstration of the proposed laser technology/architecture approach at the contractor’s facility, and an Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL) brassboard preliminary design review (PDR); Phase 2 will cover laser system modeling and simulation, a laboratory breadboard demonstration at the contractor’s facility of the full ATILL output performance requirements, and an ATILL brassboard critical design review (CDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during both phases of the technical effort.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 and 2 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2006-01.  Delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is not part of this program solicitation.  The total program budget for the technical effort is approximately $16.5M for Phase 1 and $20M for Phase 2 (~$36.5M total funding).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 30 months at ~$8M per effort.  Only one contractor may be funded for the second phase (~24 months).    The projected start date is near the end of the second quarter GFY06.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt. Dax Presuto, MDA/ALK, at 505-846-0758.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Any contractor funded for both phases under this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser  development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, risk reduction experiments, and laboratory breadboard testing to demonstrate a 5.5 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  During both phases, all modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard (subscale during Phase 1, and full-scale during Phase 2).  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

The DoD is specifically interested in approaches that address the following diode-pumped solid-state laser output performance goals (in descending order of importance):
1)	Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)	Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 5.5 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser’s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 5.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser’s PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)	Pulse Length: The laser’s full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)	Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)	Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)	Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table—the table will not induce jitter in the laser head.
8)	Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

Additionally, the DoD is interested in approaches that address the following design-to diode-pumped solid-state laser brassboard goals (in descending order of importance):
a)	Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 s (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the “laser on” periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc. will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)	Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 s.
c)	Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 12%, where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
d)	Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 12 W/kg (goal of 15 W/kg) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 459 kg (goal of 367 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)	Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 0.01 W/cm^3 (goal of 0.02 W/cm^3) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.55 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.28 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)	Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be –50 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, “storage” is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
g)	Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
h)	Operating/Storage Pressure: –1,000 ft to 10,000 ft.
i)	Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser’s Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (i).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 1 and CDR level during Phase2, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in two phases.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phase 2 offered as a contract option.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phase 2 contract option (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam’s output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

The proposal expectations (not for the RFI) are as follows: Offerors shall limit the length of their Technical Proposals to 75 pages or less, including all pages (no exceptions).  Additional information on required fonts, page formatting, etc., may be found in the BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions (to be added when the BAA is published).  Cost proposals will be limited in length to 50 pages or less, including all cost sheets, basis of estimates and other supporting information.  Cost proposal preparation instructions will be included in the RFP package when the BAA is issued.  As part of the Technical Proposal, offerors must demonstrate through past performance and corporate/institutional capabilities that they possess the resources and technical capabilities necessary to perform successfully on this BAA.  This should include identified experience designing, developing, fabricating, and testing ruggedized (TRL ~6), fieldable, high Radiance, high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser systems.  The Government encourages any interested, qualified not-for-profit laboratories/institutions (e.g., FFRDCs) or Universities that are based in the United States to team, or form suitable partnering relationships in conformance with their by laws and applicable statutes and regulations, with qualified industrial partners on this solicitation.  The intent of the intended BAA is to develop the technology and industrial base necessary to build a ruggedized, ~1.03 micron wavelength, high average power, diode-pumped solid-state laser system (TRL 6) that may be procured through a follow-on contract.

Following are questions supporting the ATILL RFI and comments on any recommended clarifications involving the aforementioned RFI:

1)  Are the proposed ATILL technical requirements achievable with currently available technology?  Are there any technical requirements that are considered to be especially difficult to achieve with currently available technology?

2)  Are the proposed schedule and funding appropriate for the proposed ATILL technology development program?

3)  What text changes and/or clarifications, if any, are recommended for the proposed ATILL BAA?

4)  A brief explanation of company/organization/institution resources and technical capabilities available/necessary to perform successfully on the proposed BAA.


Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are due no later than Close of Business on *** 21 October 2005 ***.

<DESC>THIS NOTIFICATION HAS BEEN CANCELED IN ITS ENTIRETY.





Performance Period:  May 2006 – September 2006
The National Institutes of Health Department of Clinical Bioethics has a requirement for a Contractor to procure services to prepare a manuscript providing a a theoretical justification for public participation in priority setting for health.
The supplies and services herein are being procured un accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE TAKEN REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION. PLEASE SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO AMCGEE@CC.NIH.GOV BY COB 5 PM EST. ON 9/28/05.

Background: 
Maintaining the health of a population requires a myriad of expensive interventions. Along with medical care, a number of socio-economic factors contribute toward health. Given their complexity and cost, expenditures for health must necessarily be prioritized. Public involvement in health policy has encountered a number of obstacles.  When feeling well, most individuals find that the issues lack salience, so decisions tend to be influenced heavily by health care workers.  Patients may be frustrated by the complexity of information and rely on physicians and insurers to decide for them, trusting the services they need will be provided to them in the event of illness. At the community or organizational level, the lack of consumer understanding and involvement in policy making has been identified as a serious impediment to a market-based health care system with a solid moral foundation. Over the last 8 years the Section on Ethics and Health Policy of the Department of Clinical Bioethics at the NIH has engaged in a project to design, and use decision tools that involve members of the public in resource allocation decisions for health care and other interventions aimed at ameliorating health.
While this effort has involved the accomplishment of many technical tasks such as game design, software development, and data collection and analysis, we have focused insufficient attention on a theoretical justification for the idea that the ascertainment of the public’s perspective should lead to public participation in policy setting.

Scope of Work:The contractor will be required to review the relevant literature, develop an outline for a manuscript, write and submit the manuscript for publication.
Contract Tasks to Be Performed:The Contractor, working closely with the project officer, will do the following work for the project:Review literature,Prepare a manuscript outline,Write a manuscript,Submit for publication and revise as necessary.
Program Management and Control Requirements:Contractor will confer on a weekly or biweekly basis with the investigator to review the purpose of the study and plan the manuscript and to review the progress of the project. 

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:
Progress Reports – The Contractor will submit to the Project Officer a progress report every month. The progress report will include: a description of the work to date, problems encountered, suggested resolution, hours of labor and other costs expended, and a comparison of planned project schedule to actual project schedule.

<SUBJECT>70 -- TouchTable Interactive Display System
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Intelligence Systems Division, 12900 Federal Systems Park Drive, Fairfax, VA 22033 for a Touch Table Interactive Display System with incidental services for installation, assistance with the accreditation, and integration of the Touch Table collaborative visualization capabilities. The Touch Table will fulfill a requirement for visualization capability to support USSTRATCOM/JIAPC mission to produce Holistic Target Characterizations (HTC).  HTC development requires advanced visualization support for the analysis, display and dissemination of fused intelligence and planning information to distributed Combatant Command users. HTC development is done in conjunction with other intelligence agencies, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), who partnered with Applied Minds Inc (AIM) as the innovator and Northrop-Grumman as the integrator to develop the Touch Table.  Northrop Grumman is now offering the Touch Table as a commercial product.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the individual identified below by 26 September 2005, 12:00 p.m. (cst).  Determination to award other than sole source will be at the Government’s discretion.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made due to the fact that the Touch Table must be compatible with the existing DIA Touch Table system, and that the Touch Table solution has been deployed, proven, integrated and accredited into JWICS at a Protection Level 2, and integrated into geospatial, imagery and visualization applications already in use in the Intelligence Community.  Using the Touch Table system will allow the Government to meet its stakeholder organization collaboration requirements at a substantial cost and time savings.

<SUBJECT>A -- Novel Satellite Communications (NSC) Workshop
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO) anticipates releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) during late spring 2006 for Phases III and IV of the Novel Satellite Communications (NSC) Program. The goal of the NSC Program is to develop technologies that enable a satellite communications system to receive signals from a ground-based user located close to multiple ground-based jammers. Phase I of the Program is complete. Phase II of the program is underway and involves development of the necessary algorithms and coding schemes; simulation of their performance; determination of the signal processing hardware required; and identification of the critical technology development necessary to enable the Program goal. Phase III will develop these technologies, build/integrate a real-time NSC demonstration system, and perform the test planning for the NSC tests and demonstrations that will occur in Phase IV. The Phase III and IV BAA is not a down-select from the current Phase II; it is a new competition open to all qualified proposers.  To help potential proposers understand the technologies being developed, DARPA intends to hold an NSC Workshop on the 15th and 16th of November 2005 in Fort Worth, Texas. The NSC Workshop will be classified at the collateral SECRET level. At the NSC Workshop, the Phase II contractors will describe their innovations and results. DARPAs Phase III and IV plans will also be reviewed. All attendees at the NSC Workshop must be pre-approved and pre-registered. Attendance may be limited. Potential attendees should indicate their interest no later than October 31,  2005 via e-mail to nsc@darpa.mil.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africa's longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than 2 million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than 4 million people within Sudan - the largest internally displaced person (IDP) population in the world.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, Western Sudan when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 2.6 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including 2 million IDPs and 180,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Sudan Program Officer will be part of the OFDA team based in Khartoum, Sudan.  The position will be contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.


OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Program Officer for Northern Sudan in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and is responsible for developing strategies and plans, reviewing proposals, monitoring grants, liaising with grantees and other members of the humanitarian community, and reporting on the humanitarian situation.


STATEMENT OF WORK

The OFDA Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency in areas defined as under the authority of the Government of National Unity in Northern Sudan and the transitional areas.  The Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in all parts of Sudan as needed.

The current USAID structure in Sudan consists of a Sudan Field Office in Nairobi, Kenya which coordinates all assistance to Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) areas, and an office in Khartoum which covers the Northern provinces, including Darfur, and the transitional areas.  All DCHA staff, including OFDA, Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Khartoum.  There is close daily coordination between the DCHA units in Nairobi, Kenya and Khartoum, and with the development programs managed by the Sudan Field Office.  The Program Officer will exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Southern Sudan and Darfur portfolios, as well as with the Sudan program team in Washington D.C.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance.

The Program Officer will work and live in Khartoum, reporting to the Senior Humanitarian Advisor and to the Sudan Program Team in Washington D.C.  S/he will work with a small team of experienced national staff specializing in the areas of food security, health, gender, and livelihoods.  Each national staff member also is responsible for a specific geographic area and specific grants.  The Program Officer will ensure a smooth allocation of the work load between all national staff so that maximum efficiency is achieved.

This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly abide to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), a Response Management Team (RMT), or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.

* Works in close consultation with the Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) and the Deputy SHA for Darfur to ensure that national and international staff competencies are used in the most efficient way to enhance the overall US Government response in Northern Sudan.

* Travels frequently (security permitting) to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at OFDA project sites in Sudan, and make strategic recommendations for interventions.  Reports to OFDA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.

* Participates in and reports on joint donor evaluations and United Nations (UN) led assessments, and participates actively in the international community response structures.

* Provides regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Sudan.  Provides overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keeps the Ambassador/Charge d'Affaires current on response issues.  Provides regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.

* Participates in development and implementation of OFDA and USAID strategy and plans for Sudan.

* Works with NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies that are developing proposals (including grant amendments and extensions) for OFDA, ensures their compliance with "OFDA's Guidelines for Grant Proposals and Reporting," reviews concept papers and proposals, and provides recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.

* Coordinates with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and to develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.  Prepares agendas and briefings for official U.S. government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.

<SUBJECT>10--Manned Ground Vehicle Integrated Power & Energy System Concept Study for MGV subcontractor to Future Combat Systems Program
<SOLNBR>FCSSDD-05-004
<RESPDATE>102305
<ARCHDATE>12222005

<DESC>The following is a combined synopsis/solicitation placed on FBO at the request of a Future Combat Systems program One Team Partner. It does not represent a announcement by the Government for the purchase of goods or services. The procuring entity is General Dynamics Land Systems with the contact information contained below. Please do NOT contact the buyer identified in the FBO announcement for information as you will simply be referred to GDLS. The Government is posting this information on FBO to allo w the widest range of offerors to be aware of the solicitation. Manned Ground Vehicle Integrated Power & Energy System Concept Study BIA Number: GDLS-BIA-2005-IP&E001  PRICING INFORMATION The program anticipates a funding level of up to $104,000  for each of up to three Phase 1 contract award(s) and a funding level up to $1.2M for one Phase 2 down-select contract if awarded.  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT AND TASKS The Future Combat Systems (FCS) Manned Ground Vehicle (MGV) is a System of Systems (SoS) concept of manned Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) in the nominal 24 US ton weight class.  These systems will perform a variety of tasks in support of the Organizationa l and Operational (O&O) guidelines for the SoS.  The MGV will be part of an organization of vehicles, sensors, C2 hardware & software systems, and communications systems. Variants of the FCS include combat, command, tactical and support vehicles, and will have capabilities to conduct full spectrum operations. The work effort under this SOW includes development and preparation of executable concepts for an Integrated Power and Energy (IP&E) architecture with the identification of key technologies and/or enablers to achieve MGV requirements within the development  timeframe. Optimization of power generation, energy storage and use are the drivers for this effort. FCS MGV Notional Program Schedule: Event	Tentative Date System Functional Review (SFR)	1st Quarter 2006 Preliminary Design Review (PDR)	1st  2nd Quarter 2008 Critical Design Review (CDR)	1st  2nd Quarter 2009 1st Prototypes	3rd Quarter 2010 Qualification Testing	3rd Quarter 2010 through 3rd Quarter 2012 This effort will be separated into two phases.  The first phase will consist of up to three competitive awards to different entities to independently develop concepts for an IP&E solution to efficiently meet FCS MGV requirements for a system-level solution  retaining commonality to the maximum extent possible across all MGV systems.  The second phase, if awarded, will consist of a down-select of one of the competitors, contracted in Phase 1.  The down-selected contractor will become an integral part of the F CS IP&E Analysis & Integration Team (AIT) to further mature these concepts, or concepts developed by the current FCS Integrated Project Teams (IPTs), into an executable Best Technical Approach (BTA) to meet near term and long term developmental objectives and timeframes.   The core Power and Energy System should provide an optimal balance of generated vs. stored power for mobility and non-mobility loads.  The system should feature a high availability, fault tolerant architecture and provide external power d elivery and acceptance. Above all, the system must minimize weight/volume yet provide for growth and uncertainties.   The preferred P&E architecture encompasses the hardware for power generation, energy storage, traction drive, thermal management, power di stribution, and external power.  Synergy with other subsystems such as environmental cooling and pulse power systems (e.g. active protection) is highly desirable. The selected contractor(s) must be fire-walled from their other corporate entities who maybe competing to be a FCS supplier according to FCS firewall procedures. PHASE 1 TASK DESCRIPTIONS  Task 1-1 Develop alternative concept(s) for an IP&E architecture based on FCS MGV requirements, and constraints (i.e. space, geometry and weight) exploiting synergy with other FCS pa rallel efforts, the vendors experience, and third-party technologies to define an architecture which can be expected to be achievable within the program milestone dates.   Concepts must consider all requirements, aspects and constraints including the Oper ational Requirements Document (ORD), Organizational and Operational (O&O) document, the system/sub-system requirements data base and other guiding information to ensure compatibility with program objectives.  This work will be performed independently, and in parallel to, on-going FCS program efforts Task 1-2 Apply MGV power, energy, thermal and weight budgets (static and dynamic) for the proposed solutions and show how the performance requirements will be met within these budgets while maintaining system growth capability.    Task 1-3 Prepare a draft IP&E specification to the major element level based on the developed concept.  Task 1-4   Provide ROM costs for development and production of the proposed solution, assuming 120 units in the first year of production as shown on attached Master Schedule.  Identify ROM development costs associated with the maturation of the technologies incorpora ted in the concept to ensure they are at a sufficient state of maturity (i.e. TARDEC Technology Readiness Level 4/5) to enter the FCS Increment 1 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase.  Identify Non Developmental items (NDI) in the approach tha t are already at the maturity  level for incorporation into the program.   Identify any known licensing/royalty costs associated with the use of key technologies contained in the approach Task 1-5 Provide preliminary SDD program plan to include at a minimum: preliminary system manufacturing plan, long lead items list, project critical path, preliminary subsystem/vehicle system level test plan, program risk issues, enabling technologies and their sta te of maturity and key attributes/discriminators relative to the selection of the architecture/approach for further development and Phase 2 down-select. PHASE 2 TASK DESCRIPTIONS Task 2-1 Participate in the preliminary design of an Integrated Power and Energy system for the Future Combat Systems MGV, incorporating the best features of industry and Government in concert with SoS approaches to include influence on variant and common systems, subsystems and component designs.   This will essentially be a level of effort through Preliminary Design Review but progress will be measured using Earned Value Measurement Systems (EVMS).  Tasks will be as assigned as part of the FCS IP&E Analysis & Inte gration Team (AIT).  The selected contractor must remain firewalled from their other corporate entities who maybe competing to be a FCS supplier.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.
As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:
Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2005)
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

*Note: this procurement is subject to the availability of funds* 
FAR 52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds. 

Availability of Funds (Apr 1984) 

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government’s 
obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of 
appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No 
legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until 
funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until 
the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing 
by the Contracting Officer.

OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen:

fax: (757) 764-4400
email: david.glowacki@langley.af.mil.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
