<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government.  This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing Targeted knock-in of a gene in the mouse genome.
<p>Thyroid hormone is important for promoting development and also for maintaining general health in adulthood. Type 3 deiodinase (encoded by Dio3 gene) is a thyroid hormone-inactivating enzyme. It is present in in embryonic, postnatal and adult tissues. Its expression pattern has suggested a protective role of Dio3 in immature and developing organs. To understand more precisely the tissues and cell types in which type 3 deiodinase functions, it is important to be able to trace accurately the expression pattern of the Dio3 gene. This has been a difficult challenge because the protein is expressed at low levels. There is no antibody available that reliably detects type 3 deiodinase in natural tissues. The knock-in mouse model proposed in this project is designed to bypass these difficulties and allow sensitive detection of type 3 deiodinase protein with precise cellular resolution in natural tissues.</p>
<p>The goal of the work is to generate a mouse strain that carries a specific, heritable alteration in one of its genes.  The task involves the application of gene targeting technology which is based on the process of homologous recombination to introduce the mutation into the desired gene.  This is performed in mouse embryonic stem cells which are used to create founder mice carrying the targeted mutation.  The mutation should be transmitted through the germline of the founder mice to allow generation of a colony of mice carrying the mutation for analysis.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541711 with a size standard of 500.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government.  This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing Measurement of Autoantibodies Against PFDN2.
<p>The NIDDK in Phoenix performs research studies investigating the cause of obesity and diabetes. An important aspect of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus may involve an immune response which leads to diminished insulin secretion and may involve production of autoantibodies. In particular, it has been observed that individuals without a particular HLA haplotype (HLA-DR2b) may be at higher risk for the development of diabetes because of an immune response that may decrease insulin secretion. In Phase 1, collected blood samples were screened on a protein microarray containing over 9000 unique proteins to identify possible candidate autoantibodies. Phase 2 involved screening plasma samples for antibodies to 77 candidate proteins based on evidence from Phase 1 and identified evidence of autoantibodies to 14 proteins. In Phase 3, the presence of autoantibodies to these 14 proteins were evaluated in a larger sample size and one autoantibody remained associated with type 2 diabetes in this larger cross-sectional study involving 900 samples.</p>
<p>The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541711 with a size standard of 1000.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business.

<p>2900D Biochemistry Analyzer machines, as well as two of each of the following: printer kit, 24-place capped vial tray, 12mm glass vial tray, 12mm test tube rack, 16mm test tube rack, and glucose starter kit.</p>
<p>There are currently two 2900D machines on the Metabolic Ward at the NIH Bethesda, MD; these machines constitute a pool of shared resources, and more machines are needed to support the number of research groups performing insulin clamps at this time. There must be at least three machines available for use during each insulin clamp procedure, as there are often timing errors and sometimes machine malfunctions that interfere with accurate blood glucose sample measurement in the 5-10 minute intervals.   The two 2900D machines requested must be as similar as possible to the existing two 2900D machines on the Metabolic Ward at the NIH.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
