<DESC>Synopsis:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January 2017.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2017 to January 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, South Dakota and North Dakota.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This acquisition is proceeding as Small Business Set Aside request for proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Project Description: This project replaces the existing roof system on a 480,000 square foot (sf) warehouse located on Hill Air Force Base UT. Please note that Bays G and H are currently occupied by the Air Force which will also be part of this project. The existing roof system will be removed in its entirety and a new premium two ply modified bitumen system with granulated cap sheet over a cover board and multi layered (3&frac12;") polyisocyanurate insulation over a base ply will be installed. In order for the roof insulation to meet the current building envelope requirement of ASHRAE 189.1, the R-value will be determined by life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) with R-25 minimum. R-value range for LCCA is R-25 to R-60.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>LCCA will consider solar integrated roof and cool roof features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Building 845 is a concrete structure building with concrete exterior walls and deck. Drainage is provided by roof drains located at the outside perimeter of the roof. Slope noted in the roof appears to be provided by the structure with support of tapered insulation crickets at the roof drains. The roof is 560,000 sq. ft., which is divided in to Seven (7) bays, (80,000 SF Bay) that are separated by expansion joints. Bays A through E and Bay H, approximately 480,000 SF are occupied by DLA. One of the bays is split in to two section (F &amp; G) Approximately 80,000 SF and is occupied by the Air Force. The existing roofing system is gravel coated, 4 ply built-up asphalt roofing plies over insulation with a 2 ply asphalt applied to the concrete topping slab. The insulation on the roof consists of 2 layers of &frac34;" perlite with a &frac34;" base layer of polyisocyanurate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is assumed that the insulation thickness is uniform with the exception of the crickets provided at the drain locations. Thus the presumption was made that the structure provides the slope in the roof and not the insulation. The thermal resistivity is estimated to be less that R-9 with today's insulation values. The flashings at the curb areas (equipment and expansion joint curbs) have a modified bitumen granulated sheet for a base ply.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The existing roof system was likely installed in the late 1980s and is nearing the end of its useful life. There is a possibility of asbestos in the existing roof system that will need to be abated in the project. The penetrations through the roof system consist of air ventilators, "capped" roof curbs, exhaust vents, plumbing vents, roof drains, pitch pans, equipment curbs, and piping penetrations. Water mitigation for these roof sections is provided by roof drains located at the outside perimeter edge with crickets located between drains. Access to the roof areas is provided by a ladder. While the roof areas presently continue to perform and it appears that some previous repairs have been made, the warrantable condition and the expected life of the existing roofing system has been exceeded in all areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government estimates issuing the Notice to Proceed (NTP) on or about 29 March 2017.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of performance for construction is estimated to be 365 calendar days from NTP. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This time frame is critical component of this project and is non-negotiable.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In accordance with the DFAR 236.204, the magnitude disclosure of this construction project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This proposed contract action will be conducted using FSC Code: Y1GZ and North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS): 238160 and the small business size standard is $15 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>Summary:
<p>Request for Information - Market Research to support Qualified Products List (QPL) of the T-11 Personnel Parachute System</p>
<p>1. This is NOT a solicitation for bids/proposals but a Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12. There is NO Government funding associated with this exact posting.</p>
<p>2. This RFI is issued for the sole purpose of the Product Manager - Soldier Clothing &amp; Individual Equipment (PdM SCIE), through the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD), to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10 to begin Pre-Award Qualifications for the T-11 Personnel Parachute System in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.2.</p>
<p>3. To be considered for this requirement, respondents are required to submit a Technical and Management Proposal which will be reviewed by the Government. After approval of this proposal, respondents shall submit two (2) complete QPL samples of either the T-11 system or any components and assemblies they wish to qualify. Both of these submissions are at the respondent's expense. Manufacturers who have previously been on the T-11 or MC-6 QPL may request a waiver on the parts they were previously qualified. Information concerning these submittals is found in the INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF QPL SAMPLE SUBMISSION of this proposal, and in MIL-DTL-6645, paragraph 3.2, Qualification Requirements. QPL sample waiver sample criteria is found in paragraph 2.f of INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF QPL SAMPLE SUBMISSION.</p>
<p>4. Patterns required for the manufacture of the components are available in electronic format (CAD) and will be distributed to all respondents who have a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on file with the Contracting Officer. Requests for the CAD drawings may be submitted to Mr. G. Mark Whiteman at g.m.whiteman.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>Non-Disclosure Agreements may be requested from Mr. Matthew Buchanan at matthew.r.buchanan6.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>5. Respondents must submit their QPL samples in accordance with the Technical Data Package (TDP) and the instructions attached herein. The TDP will be sent upon receipt of the Non-Disclosure Agreement by the Point of Contact (POC).</p>
<p>6. The evaluation of the QPL samples, documentation, and a site inspection is forecast to take up to 8 months per manufacturer. This time frame is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of contractor's proposal and sample submissions.</p>
<p>7. Prospective Manufacturers shall notify the primary POC listed below before shipping any documentation or QPL samples for qualification. To aid in the traceability, timeliness, documentation and processing of the QPL submission, manufacturers should also include the method of shipment and any relevant tracking information.</p>
<p>8. Only manufacturers who are recertified or added to the QPL for the entire system at the time of an anticipated contract award can be considered for award of future Government acquisitions for the T-11 Personnel Parachute System.</p>
<p>9. Prospective manufacturers are allowed to submit QPL samples for evaluation at any time. For consideration of complete T-11 system qualification, the samples will not be reviewed until the technical and management proposal is submitted and accepted by the Government. Sample evaluations will occur on a first-delivered, first-served basis.</p>
<p>10. The Government intends to recertify all manufacturers on the QPL for the T-11 Personnel Parachute Systems every four (4) years. Previously qualified contractors are required to requalify for consideration of future contract awards.</p>
<p>11. PM SCIE is forecasting the award of a Multiple Award 5-year Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Firm Fixed Price contract for systems in 1FY18; however, this is subject to change.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p><br />Introduction<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN) posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. It will be used to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (e.g.: 8(a), small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and small business) to provide the services described herein. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will use the information received to determine if the work described herein will be set-aside for small business. Based upon the results of the evaluation of the respondents' capabilities, CMS may set the work aside for a specific type of small business (i.e. HUBZone, WOSB, SDB, SDVOSB, or 8(a) small business), or determine that the work should be competed on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is the agency of the Federal Government that administers the Medicare and M&not;edicaid programs. CMS also supports the Affordable Care Act with the CMS Marketplace and supporting systems. It should be noted that the CMS Marketplace has become one of the most visible programs, both politically and technologically, in the Nation.</p>
<p>CMS is responsible for the payment of almost $1 trillion each year for medical services rendered to over 100 million program beneficiaries and recipients. CMS currently has approximately 4,500 employees at its central site in Baltimore, and in ten (10) regional offices in major cities throughout the country. CMS contracts with approximately thirty (30) companies to process claims for reimbursement for medical services rendered under the Medicare program, and works with all 50 states in the management of the Medicaid program. Several companies administer both Part A and Part B of the Medicare program. As a result, there are currently twenty-three (23) fiscal intermediaries and seventeen (17) carriers processing Medicare fee-for-service claims.</p>
<p>In the administration of these programs, CMS utilizes many assets including buildings, facilities, communications equipment, computer systems, employees, contractors, public trust, and information. A loss of any one of these assets could affect the quality of support provided by CMS to its various customers. In particular, CMS needs systems of cost effective computer security controls to protect CMS' critical information technology assets. CMS collects information that falls into the categories of privacy data, personal health data, proprietary data, procurement data, inter-agency data, and privileged system information. Access to these types of information is controlled by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Computer Security Act of 1987, as amended, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, as amended and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, as well as various rules, regulations, policies, and guidelines promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As a result, CMS has a legal and practical responsibility to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of this information.<br />The CMS Information System (IS) Security Assessment and Authorization (SAA) Program is a critical component of the entire CMS Integrated IT Investment &amp; System Life Cycle, "Framework", which has been most recently updated to the CMS Expedited Life Cycle (XLC). All CMS systems must undergo a Security Controls Assessment (SCA) each year as part of effort towards obtaining or maintaining its current security accreditation and authorization to operation (ATO).</p>
<p>CMS has introduced many new technical initiatives in the last two (2) years including several new Cloud Services, Agile development, DevOps software deployment models, CI/CD processes, ongoing authorization, and build-in security processes. CMS is also building in a new CDM program per HHS directives. The Contractor will utilize these CMS initiatives to improve CMS' ability to automate as many security controls as possible and continue to move toward the Ongoing Authorization model.</p>
<p>CMS will focus security efforts on the most critical security controls (as defined by CMS).</p>
<p>The Security Controls Assessment (SCA) is conducted as part of the Security Assessment and Authorization (SAA) process for a new system before it is placed into an operational state, when a significant change has been made to an existing system, or at least every three years. CMS is moving away from this point-in-time testing model and pushing towards the ongoing authorization and build-in security in models where automated and frequent control testing is going to become the norm. Currently, the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) still plays a vital role with assisting and validating that appropriate management, operational, and technical security controls have been implemented for the information system and that CMS systems and data are protected.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of Security Controls Assessment (SCA) is to provide continuous security controls assessment and ongoing authorization (OA) support for the CMS Enterprise Information Security Group (ISPG). This will be achieved while maintaining compliance with the defined CMS IS policies, standards, procedures and guidelines as stated on the CMS Website: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html.</p>
<p>SCA Scope of Services and Required Capabilities<br />The Contractor shall perform SCAs of cyber-services, applications, databases, platforms, and infrastructures of all CMS FISMA systems. CMS systems are located throughout the continental United States in disparate data centers which are often built using a combination solution such as of bare-metal rack oriented servers, virtualized server technologies, Cloud Service Provider technologies (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), as well as various Identification and Authentication mechanisms such as SAML, OpenID, Oauth, and CSP IDaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Each CMS system may be composed of various heterogeneous technologies ranging from modern to legacy, which may include but is not limited to: all types of Cloud Service Provider technologies (MS Azure, AWS, Salesforce, etc.), microservice (API) based systems, various development frameworks and components such as .Net, Java, JMS, SOAP, REST, XML, JSON, JWT, supporting middleware, Unix, various flavors of Linux servers (RHEL, Solaris, Debian, CentOs, etc.), Windows servers (all versions), VMWare, database systems (MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, etc.), Mainframe technologies such as M204, DB2, RACF, CICS, COBOL, Host On Demand, TSO, z/OS, LDAP, RACF, Visual Basic, web systems such as IIS, WebSphere, MQ Messaging, Informatica, COGNOS, Citrix, and other products and technologies. Many applications are custom developed and will require a source code review and manual testing during the security assessment.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be able to perform SCAs and have experience in testing all of the technologies listed above (or similar technologies) and more, as well as capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. SCA CADENCE<br />CMS currently tracks approximately 230 systems in its system inventory. CMS maintains a rigorous pace of system security control evaluation throughout the fiscal year. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created a methodology of risk identification and prioritization of the top 20 high risk security areas for government and industry. Each system within CMS will have the CIS Top 20 Critical Security Controls (CSCs) - as well as some select CMS security and privacy controls - tested once per year by the Contractor. The Contractor will plan on a one (1) week "onsite" testing window for the vast majority of CMS systems and applications.</p>
<p>However, CMS has also approximately 40 data centers for which ALL of the CMS/NIST 800-53 rev 4 security controls will need to be tested (not just the CIS CSCs). It is reasonable to assume that these larger environments and larger control sets will take two (2) weeks for the Contractor to complete the respective security assessment.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide staff resources appropriately such that they are able to complete a total of 4 to 5 security assessments per week, allowing appropriate lead time when testing a larger data center. CMS estimates that the work defined in this SOW will require approximately 12 -15 fulltime staff to properly execute.</p>
<p>2. SCA CONTROL SET<br />A typical security assessment shall consist of testing systems for effective implementation of the CIS Top 20 Critical Security Controls (CSCs), as well as some additional CMS security and privacy controls. Appendix A contains a list of the CIS Top 20 CSCs for reference. This sample list of tests is not all-inclusive, and, all tests listed may not be required for all assessments. The Contractor will work with the Business Owner, ISSO, and ISPG to determine which types of tests are required for each system and its respective assessment.<br /><br />3. CDM INTEGRATION<br />The CMS Continuous Monitoring and Enterprise Vulnerability Management Programs use the nCircle IP360 system to scan for vulnerabilities at about 80% of CMS systems and applications. The system collects and reports on vulnerability information on operating systems, databases, and applications. When applicable, the Contractor shall be able to request nCircle IP360 reports for analysis in determining vulnerabilities during infrastructure SCAs and as directed by the GTL. <br />4. APPLICATION TIER TESTING<br />As part of the SCA, CMS requires that the Contractor place a strong emphasis on Application and Database security. This may include penetration testing with tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp. An analysis of the application build process must also be performed and a source code analysis may be needed to supplement the security assessment.</p>
<p>The type and degree of analysis performed will depend largely on the type of application being assessed. Legacy applications built using COBOL will require little or no source code review. However, new web services, APIs, and other custom applications may require static application security testing (SAST) and/or dynamic application security testing (DAST).</p>
<p>5. TEST DATA TRANSFER AND STORAGE<br />The Contractor shall use the CMS internal system of record for security documentation, namely CFACTS, to store and share artifacts generated as a result of each assessment.</p>
<p>CMS has implemented the CMS FISMA Control Tracking System (CFACTS), Trusted Integration's Agent software, as the tool that tracks security deficiencies, Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&amp;M), and Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). All security controls tested and findings discovered during an SCA must be presented in a CFACTS Management Worksheet at the end of the assessment and as part of the Final SCA Package.</p>

REQUIRED REGISTRATION WITH CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS)

As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.Â  The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.Â  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.Â  CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS.Â  CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS).Â  FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.

Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 is required to register with CPARS database at the following web address: www.cpars.csd.disa.mil.Â  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the Contractor s registered representative.Â  

For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.Â  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually.Â  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.Â  The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment.Â  The Contractor representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer. 

Failure to have a current registration with the CPARS database, or to re-assign the report to the CO within those thirty days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond.Â

REQUIRED REGISTRATION WITH CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS)

As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.Â  The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.Â  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.Â  CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS.Â  CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS).Â  FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.

Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 is required to register with CPARS database at the following web address: www.cpars.csd.disa.mil.Â  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the Contractor s registered representative.Â  

For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.Â  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually.Â  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.Â  The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment.Â  The Contractor representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer. 

Failure to have a current registration with the CPARS database, or to re-assign the report to the CO within those thirty days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond.Â

<DESC><strong>Type of Notice:</strong>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) focuses on research to discover genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and identifying new approaches to cancer prevention.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>DCEG plans to build a prospective multi-center adult cohort study of 150,000-200,000 adult participants enrolled through U.S. integrated health care systems to study the causes of cancer and the means of its prevention. The core objectives of the cohort are for participants to complete an online consent followed by an online questionnaire, and provide blood and urine donation as well as possibly discard samples (e.g. discard Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) cards). The cohort will additionally have all of the desirable attributes of a contemporary study as part of its core objectives including serial biospecimens, tumor tissue, comprehensive data from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) on elements such as drug prescription, medical conditions and procedures, and repeated questionnaires combined with reliable passive and long-term follow-up strategies for cancer ascertainment.  In addition to providing a rich source of information for a wide variety of hypotheses about the etiology of cancer, the cohort infrastructure will also be designed to allow investigation of non-cancer outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular events, diabetes). It would also allow for enhancements to be added at any phase to allow more detailed assessment of certain exposures (e.g. environmental exposures, lifestyle factors), collection of additional specimens (e.g. oral wash, stool), and to facilitate patient-centered and health delivery research to improve patient care through evidence-based decisions.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Three separate acquisitions are anticipated to create the proposed successful large-scale cohort, including a support service contractor for field activities (See Sources Sought Notice HHS-NIH-NCI-ETSB-1007-58); software solution for IT systems infrastructure; and integrated health care system(s) to serve as recruitment sites (See Sources Sought Notice HHS-NIH-NCI-ETSB-1009-58).</p>
<p>This notice pertains to the software solutions for IT systems infrastructure. The successful software solution contractor will provide a cost-effective integrated study and data management system that will utilize state-of-the-art data analytics platforms to capture all study related data and to monitor all study activities related to recruitment, enrollment, specimen collection, follow-up and add on components. The successful contractor will also be responsible for providing the study website, systems integration, database system, and data management. This infrastructure will also serve as a platform for data and biospecimen access for researchers. The successful contractor will work in collaboration with the recruitment sites, support service contractor for field activities, the NCI, and other entities through all the various study activities.</p>
<p>Specific tasks to be performed by the successful contractor include the following:</p>
<p>(a)	Develop and maintain a study website with different dashboards and tiered access for different roles. For example, the website shall include: user-friendly interface to be used by participants (e.g. to complete e-consent and questionnaires, access study information), the study team (e.g. to access real-time monitoring of study activities) and researchers (e.g. to provide access to query of data for high level planning and for research analysis).</p>
<p>(b)	Develop and maintain a study monitoring and management system (similar to a Customer Relationship Management system) that integrates and tracks all study operations, including automated reports, reminders etc. The system shall have the capability to be accessed through multiple devices (e.g. computer, tablet, smart phone) by the study team.</p>
<p>(c)	Identify and implement system integration of research data from multiple sources (e.g. e-questionnaire, electronic medical records, laboratory information management system, linkage data) into an integrated database system that is centrally accessible.</p>
<p>(d)	Develop an automated data management system that incorporates automated quality control checks, provides extensive logs for error checking, and alerts errors that require troubleshooting on a study dashboard.<br /> <br />(e)	Develop a data query tool system (e.g. Entity-Attribute-Value Model) that can be accessed through the study website and will provide data without personal identifiers. The tool shall allow to researchers to perform queries on the following: research data overview, visualization, export, in-depth analysis, metadata on variables, data processing rules and guidelines.</p>
<p>(f)	Implement and maintain robust privacy and data security protections in accordance with Agency policies.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year option periods.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic, PWD Maine, is seeking eligible Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses capable of performing construction services required to provide and install a security gate at the Cutler Power Plant located at the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station in Cutler, ME.  The work pertaining to this project is summarized as:

The contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment, tools, transportation, and supervision required to provide and install a new, tracked, industrial grade, teleswing security gate at the existing large overhead door at the Power Plant.
  

The appropriate Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business Size Standard is $36,500,000.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is under $25,000.  The contract(s) will include FAR clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting, which states that âThe concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.â  This office anticipates award of a contract for these services by February 2017.  The Contractor shall complete the entire work ready for use not later than 90 calendar days after award.

It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the Contracting Officer a brief capabilities statement package in order to demonstrate the ability to perform the construction services described, which must include:

1.	A one-page Company Profile to include the following:

a.	Number of offices and office location(s);
b.	Number of employees per office;
c.	DUNS number; 
d.	CAGE Code;
e.	Small business designation/status claimed; 
f.	Annual revenue.

A copy of the Contractorâs current SAM.gov registration information may be substituted for the profile provided it reflects all of the information requested.

2.	The completed NAVFAC Sources Sought Questionnaire, which form is attached to this 
notice.
  

The Partnering Information portion of the questionnaire may be skipped as inapplicable to a project of this small scope.  The questionnaire should be used to document a minimum of two (2) relevant construction projects completed in the past five (5) years that best demonstrate your experience on projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity.  

A relevant project is further defined as:  
       
Size:  		A construction cost of no more than $25,000.

Scope:  	Construction, renovation or repair of building facilities.

Complexity: 	Building structural repairs/installation.

The rest of the questionnaire is self-explanatory, and all boxes should be filled out as applicable.
 

In addition to the above items, you may also submit a capabilities statement for review (no page limitation on this, brochures are acceptable), but it is not required.

This notice is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award.  Upon review of industry response to this sources sought notice, the Government will determine whether set-aside procurement in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governmentâs best interest.  Large business submittals will not be considered.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.
  

The information provided in this notice is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.  The Government will not provide debriefs on the results of this research, but feedback regarding the decision to set aside or not set aside the procurement will be accomplished via pre-solicitation synopsis or solicitation for these services, as applicable.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential manner and will only be used for the purpose intended.  Points of contact listed may be contacted for the purpose of verifying performance.

RESPONSES ARE DUE NLT JANUARY 3, 2017 at 2:00 PM (EDT).  LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

The package shall be sent via electronic mail (preferred method) to Lynn Pina at Lynn.Pina@Navy.mil or mailed to:

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 
PROMISE PROGRAM SUPPORT SERVICES 
(Non-Personal Services)

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires data collection and analysis services for the Performance Reporting and Outcomes Measurements to Improve Standards of care at End-of-Life (PROMISE) Center located at the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center (CMCVAMC) (Philadelphia) [also known as the Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Resource Center]. The PROMISE Center was established in 2009 as part of the Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative.  The goal of the PROMISE Center and the Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) is to identify and reduce unwanted variability in end-of-life care throughout the VA and to define and disseminate processes of care that contribute to improved outcomes for Veterans near the end-of-life and their families.  Beginning in FY2011, the BFS was one of two Veteran-centric measures in the National Directors  Performance Plan (NDPP). 
The Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) is comprised of 19 items. Sixteen forced-choice items focus on specific aspects of care that the Veteran received at a VA inpatient facility during the last month of life. These items evaluate performance on areas of care including communication, emotional and spiritual support, pain/PTSD management, benefits, and personal care needs.
Two open-ended questions solicit comments about both positive and negative aspects of care (e.g., how could the care be improved, and what else would you like to share about the Veteran's care during the last month of life?). The BFS Performance Measure (BFS-PM) consists of a single item on the BFS that asks respondents to provide a global rating of care during the last month of life. The BFS-PM is dichotomized into  Excellent  versus all other responses (i.e.,  Very good, Good, Fair, Poor ) and the facility / organizational level BFS-PM score reflects the percentage of respondents that rate care as  Excellent.  The BFS-PM is endorsed by the National Quality Forum (http://www.qualityforum.org/ProjectMeasures.aspx?projectID=73867). 
A slightly modified BFS is currently being expanded to support the Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) programs throughout the VA.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

The Contractor(s) shall provide the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center (CMCVAMC) (Philadelphia), 3900 Woodland Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19104 with producing, printing, mailing and data collection services for the BFS to family members of deceased Veterans serviced by the VA Healthcare system as outlined below, but not limited to:  

Creation of Mailing Products/Surveys

The VA currently utilizes existing templates for products mailed out to recipients (reference document appendix). The contract shall make minor changes to templates upon VA request at no cost to the VA. If contractor incurs costs in modifying the templates, VA Contracting Officer will approve all additional costs prior to work being performed by the contractor.  

Products will be produced in both English and Spanish. Spanish materials will be sent to households where Veterans are serviced within the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, is designated as a Spanish speaking household or where Spanish is the primary language   language preference is identified by the VA to the Contractor.

Address File Cleaning 
Addressing
Matching
Mailing
Data Collection Service
Transfer of Resultant Survey Data

Results Reporting

The contractor shall provide all services and written materials required to support the analyses of data and report preparation needed to produce the periodic reports from the Bereaved Family Survey (BFS), to include, but not limited to: 

Quarterly (4 times a calendar year) VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) reports
Quarterly (4 times a calendar year) VISN reports.  
The contractor shall develop full national, VISN (Veterans Integrated Service Network), facility and bed section data as required for each BFS Report on at least on a monthly basis 
Provide technical training and documentation to PROMISE as needed to insure maximum practical use at all organizational levels.

The data will contain tagging, so as to link individual surveys to a specific decedent.  These items must be reported at the national, VISN, facility and bed section, as applicable.  

Question level results are required; including both positive scores for appropriate questions and frequencies by each response category on a continuous basis. 

All results are to be made available to PROMISE staff.  

Data Collection Methodology

PROMISE requires that the surveys are sent via first class mail using a carefully timed mailing sequence designed to produce the highest possible response rate while keeping postal costs as low as possible.  

The mailing and response cycle requirements are delineated in Appendix A: Mailing and Response Time Schedule.

A web-based option is available in English and Spanish for NOKs to complete if they choose.  The web-based option is secure and does not allow for multiple completions of the survey online.  

Details of Process and Deliverables

Table 2.1 outlines some details regarding the frequency and sample size of each survey project.  The estimated total number of Next of Kin of Veterans to be mailed a survey for all population groups is approximately 25,000/year.  
The Survey Preparation phase will involve intense collaboration between PROMISE and the contractor as questionnaires are changed into a scannable format, cover-letters and envelopes are set-up and proofed, incorrect addresses are eliminated, and final sample sizes are determined.  
Active Data Collection, regular reports of progress, and delivery of accurate final data sets and related files will be the prime responsibility of the contractor.  
The forms to be used, the approximate numbers of patients, and the frequency for each study are annotated in Table 2.1.

Quantities for All Surveys

PROMISE annually will target an estimated 25,000 Next of Kin who meet selection criteria for all population groups.  It is anticipated that the National Change of Address (NCOA) and Code 1 processes will reject a percentage of these addresses.
The PROMISE team projects HBPC to be approximately 1,650 patients in the 2016 cycle that meet the criteria for the BFS. Every year, it is projected the PROMISE program will expand to an additional 2 to 3 VISNs, or an additional 500-750 patients each cycle.   Table 2.2 annotates the forecasted surveys to be executed within the HBPC patient population.

Table 3.1: Materials for BFS

Process 

VA will provide the vendor the address files in Excel 2010 file (compressed if necessary using PKZIP), and must undergo Code 1 mail-streaming and National Change of Address (NCOA) cleaning.  The vendor s systems must be compatible with these methods.  
An output file containing the rejected names and addresses must be provided to PROMISE along with the reject code or some explanation for reason of rejection.
The output containing the names and addresses of those records retained after NCOA cleaning (i.e. cleared for mailing) must be provided to PROMISE in the layout described in Appendix B: Mailing Output File Format.  
Information regarding the NCOA process can be obtained from the Post Office or other survey vendors that provide mailing services.  NCOA software is available through a software retailer.  NCOA software must be updated monthly, at a minimum, to guarantee accuracy.
The PROMISE is currently using SAS 9.3 and Microsoft Office 2010 on a Windows 7 Enterprise operating system.  The vendor must have compatible systems in order to work with all VA systems and must adhere to Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocols and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), as appropriate, in the transference of any sensitive patient identifiable data.  All data transfers must be completed via PKI encrypted email through the VA virtual private network (VPN) access that will be provided.

Personalization of Survey Materials 

Four versions of the survey, male and female specific, each in English and Spanish, will be mailed according to the gender of the deceased Veteran and facility of death (VA Caribbean Healthcare System decedents or other identified by the VA will receive the gender specific Spanish language version of the survey).  
The addressing for the survey cover letter will, at a minimum, contain the name and address of the Veteran s Next of Kin (NOK), the name of the Veteran, and his/her unique identification number (provided by the PROMISE Center).  The purpose of the patient unique identification number serves as a way of tracking respondents so that their names will not appear directly on the questionnaire.  The PROMISE Center guarantees survey respondents  anonymity.  
The identification numbering system used to track surveys specifies a unique number to each individual in the sample.  This number will be used during data analysis to link survey respondents to their demographic data.  The numbering system will be provided by the PROMISE Center to the vendor.

Data Collection 

Data collection for the surveys will be done using optical scanning or digital image capture techniques backed up by direct double entry keypunching where necessary for damaged surveys.  
Data shall be reported back to PROMISE based on the schedule detailed in Attachment A: Mailing and Response Time Schedule and in the format provided in Attachment C: Data File to PROMISE Format.  
The Bereaved Family Survey contains two questions that are open-ended to allow additional feedback from families.  All these responses shall be provided in full as digital images and transcribed with the responses linked to the unique identifier for correct identification by the PROMISE Center. These responses shall be transmitted to PROMISE on a monthly basis with the raw survey data. 

Whitemail Processing 

Additional comments that NOKs enclose on attached sheets of paper, recorded audiocassettes, photographs, etc. are commonly called  white mail .  The vendor will be required to screen all whitemail for NOKs in distress or in need of critical assistance.  These conditions include but, are not limited to: language consistent with threats of suicide, homicide or other threats to self or others, threats of lawsuit, and indications of depression and or desperation, or complaints being brought to the President, members of Congress or the local media.  
Any instance of a critical alert in whitemail must be brought to the attention of PROMISE immediately for review and response via telephone or fax, depending on the urgency, and follow up next day mailing of any original correspondence to PROMISE.  
All contractor staff screening whitemail will be required to complete available suicide and depressions training courses available through the VA s Talent Management System (TMS).  
Non-critical whitemail must be returned to PROMISE for processing, at a minimum, once a week as some of the material may be time sensitive.  Each piece of white mail sent to PROMISE must have the patient s ID code to allow rapid follow-up in critical situations. Special care must be taken to ensure the security of these identified documents in transit and to ensure that items received by PROMISE are in the form it was received by the Vendor. 

Return to Sender (RTS) and Deceased NOKs

The file containing the sample of patients provided by PROMISE will only include Veterans that were known to have died as an inpatient and deceased Veterans with HBPC at time of the sample pull, and although PROMISE requires the vendor to run the mailing list through NCOA and Code 1 mail streaming to remove any incorrect addresses, some Veteran s Next of Kin pass away or move before the surveys reach them.  Any survey returned to the vendor as undeliverable will be coded in the data set as  returned to sender  or  deceased  according to the reason noted on the envelope. This information is important for statistical purposes to compute our true and adjusted response rates. 
Any whitemail forwarded to PROMISE from returned surveys marked as deceased must have some indicator written on them by the vendor that the accompanying survey has been coded as deceased in the data file.

Mailing 

The business reply envelopes must have the name of the PROMISE Center and the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VAMC as the recipient of the returned piece along with the address of the data processing facility of the vendor.  
The mailing of all components must be done via first class mail, taking advantage of all available sorting and bulk mail discounts.  At the completion of each mailing segment (reference Attachment A: Mailing and Response Time Schedule), a postal summary of all activity, including postage costs incurred, will be supplied to the VA by the vendor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-17-036 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-87. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with Nikon Instruments, Inc. of 1300 Walt Whitman Road, Melville, NY 11747 for the acquisition of the following: PCO.EDGE 4.2 LT SCMOS CAMERA, a 64Bit Z440 64GB/256GB SS DR/4TB DR WIN7, 27" LED IPS MONITOR, Z27N, and CUSTOM OASIS IMPLANT SYSTEM. <br /><br />One of the fundamental goals of neuroscience is dissecting out specific neural circuits and comprehending how their endogenous firing pattern or "blueprint." Unfortunately, this latter aim has remained elusive due to limitations in technology. Therefore, the NIDDK has a requirement to obtain a wireless microscope system that images through a fiber-bundle allowing the NIDDK to image up to four cell populations simultaneously, which is crucial for understanding how multiple cell populations facilitate complex behavior. Doing so will place the NIDDK in an ideal position to investigate the specific, temporal activity of neuronal subsets while the animal is tasked with complex behaviors.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-17-T-0089 is issued as a competitive procurement. The Government intends to purchase on a firm fixed-price basis, and to solicit and negotiate the proposed purchase order on a competitive basis for TABLEAU Desktop Professional-Licenses and Server-Web Client Interactor with 1 year maintenance, under the authority implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by FAR Part 12 and 13.
<p>Tableau Data Visualization software was selected for the Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) Initiative in support of H-1, H-60, H-53, V-22, and E-2D platforms to display large amount of logistics data and aircraft data files for improved fleet health monitoring. This requirement is brand name 100 % match only! Substitute or similar product will not be accepted. Establishing a second source would be a lengthy process and such unrecoverable schedule slippage represents an unacceptable risk to the CBM+Initiative. At this time, no alternate technical solution can leveraged without significant redesign.</p>
<p>Although not set-aside for Total Small Business, offers are solicited only from small business concerns. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to small business owners.</p>
<p>***Basis for Award***</p>
<p>Solicitation closing date/time is firm; proposals received after the deadline will not be accepted. Your quote must contain enough technical information i.e. data sheet, drawing, specification, etc. for evaluation. Your quote will only be evaluated based on the information provided. The award will be made on the basis of lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factor. This is a firm fixed-price procurement; therefore, the initial offer should represent the vendor's best quote in terms of price and technical acceptability. A determination by the Government not to accept the proposal for not meeting the minimum requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) Database prior to submission of an offer to be considered for award of any Department of Defense contract. This can be accomplished electronically at http://www.sam.gov/vendor.cfm. The Government will not pay for any information received</p>

Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.   The items requiring repair / modification are contained on the Attachment A to this notice.  Even though these items are sole source to Teledyne Reynolds, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. For questions concerning this notice, contact Zachary Dunn, 215-697-5778, email: zachary.s.dunn@navy.mil.

The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure: http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfmâ. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS - P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS - P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

(5) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and reference information (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information). (6) Price and any supporting details for the price, as requested in the solicitation. (c) Offerors are responsible for submitting quotations, and any modifications thereto, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified. The offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received. <BR> <BR>Insert clause 1352.239?70, Software License Addendum, in all contracts when the primary purpose is to purchase new software licenses or renew existing licenses. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1339.107, insert the following clause: Software License Addendum (APR 2010) (a) This Addendum incorporates certain terms and conditions relating to Federal procurement actions.

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(b) A complete copy of all GAO or Court of Federal Claims protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon (i) the Contracting Officer, and (ii) the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel, within one day of filing a protest with either GAO or the Court of Federal Claims. (c) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C.

(2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI).

Processing requirements for High and Moderate Risk Contracts are as follows: (1) The contractor must complete and submit the following forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): (i) Standard Form 85P (SF-85P), Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions; (ii) FD-258, Fingerprint Chart with OPM's designation in the ORI Block; and (iii) Credit Release Authorization. (2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team Leader is a member of the USAID Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Chief of FPD, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Pakistan (PAK), Middle East (ME), and Europe and Asia (EA).

<p>Under this solicitation, the Regional Team Leader will be responsible for overseeing specific OTI country programs in the LAC region, supervising program teams in Washington, DC and the field, and serving as the principle OTI interlocutor on all existing and forecasted programs in the region.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide changes to Sections B,C,J,L and respond to offeror's questions.

Refer to the Summary of Changes and the revised Sections for details.

The FAA will provide another amendment to answer ALL remaining questions received.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Guan and Puerto Rico under the National Security Officer Program (NSOP).  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.

This Screening Information Request/Request For Offer (SIR)/(RFO) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within Eastern Service Area (ESA).  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  

1.	INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION
The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements.

2.  CONTRACT TYPE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with three Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLINs) and one Cost Reimbursable (CR) CLIN and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options with security officer services anticipated to begin on September 30, 2017.  It is the FAAâs intention that any new awardee will have an initial three month transition period prior to the security officer services start date.  The FAA will award one contract resulting from this individual Service Area SIR.

3.  NATURE OF COMPETITION
This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  
Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governmentâs expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clauses may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

---------------------------------------------------------------
1.  INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Guan and Puerto Rico under the National Security Officer Program (NSOP).  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.

This Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR)/ (RFO) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the FAA  Western Service Area (WSA).  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements.

2.  CONTRACT TYPE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with three Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLINs) and one Cost Reimbursable (CR) CLIN.  The anticipated period of performance of this contract incorporates a period of 12 monthâs base period and four 12 months option periods with security officer services expected to begin on September 30, 2017.  It is the FAAâs intention that any new awardee will have an initial three month transition period prior to the security officer services start date.  The FAA will award one contract resulting from this individual Service Area SIR.

3.  NATURE OF COMPETITION
This acquisition will involve the use of streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 - Security Guards and Patrol Services. The small business size standard for this code is $20.5 million.  

Tiered Evaluation: In order to provide opportunities for small businesses and to ensure that FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:

I.	SEDB/8(a) Businesses
II.	Small Businesses
III.	Other Than Small Businesses

(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.

(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.

With the exception of joint ventures, all business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers. Adequate competition exists when two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Governmentâs expressed requirement. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition.

Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area award but have the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on other Service Area awards without restriction. The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer. Under the first two tiers, Small Business offerors are reminded that in accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting, at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor. AMS clause 3.6.1-7 may be viewed in full text at http://conwrite.faa.gov.   Under the third tier, in accordance with Section I AMS Clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan (August 2012) (c) the offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 

Alternate proposals will not be evaluated. In the event a proposal is rejected a notice will be sent to the Offeror stating the reason(s) that the proposal will not be given further consideration.

All responses to this SIR must follow all submission instructions found in Section L of the SIR.

The FAA will not pay any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any response to this solicitation.

Prototype vehicles with the capability to interface with mission payloads are planned for delivery. Based upon the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicated there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement as a small business set aside (FAR 19.502-2(b)).</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued electronically via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://fbo.gov and interested parties must comply with that announcement.

<DESC>There was some confusion relating to the mileage restriction included in this procurement. 

This amendment is hereby provided to reduce the confusion. This procurement is restricted to Small Business (SB) firms located within a 350 mile radius of the Ann Arbor VA Health Care System, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2303.  

 This mileage restriction is in Compliance with VAAR 805.207(b) .    

In order to fully clarify this we revised the following Evaluation Factor related to geographic location. Evaluation Factor Number Five currently reads: 

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 350 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 350 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion.

Evaluation Factor Number Five has been revised to read as follows:  

(5) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. Scoring will be based off of the proposed location of the Prime Contractor Firm for this category and scoring shall be as follows:  within 50 miles   Excellent (Blue); 51-100 miles - Very Good (Green); 101-150 - Acceptable (Yellow); 151-200 - Marginal (Orange); 201-250:  ; 251-350   Poor (Red).

JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1. Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
Technology Acquisition Center
23 Christopher Way 
Eatontown, NJ 07724

2. Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for the renewal of enterprise-level AtHoc Personnel Directory Integration Module (PDIM) software licenses and maintenance support.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  VA, Human Resources and Administration (HRA) has a requirement to renew 16 existing enterprise-level AtHoc PDIM software licenses with continued maintenance support from the Original Software Developer.  HRA is responsible for managing the VA Notification System (VANS) that is currently supported by AtHoc s Interactive Warning System (IWS) Alert software in use by VA.  During the 2009 National Level Exercise  Eagle Horizon,  it was revealed that VA was unable to fulfill the mission essential function to account for employees during an emergency.  The Assistant Secretary for HRA, who has the responsibility for employee accountability, convened a Department-wide task force to develop recommendations to improve reporting procedures.  This resulted in the development of the VA Personnel Accountability System (PAS).  The proposed action is in support of PAS, which is the result of integration of the VANS application (AtHoc IWS software) with the U.S. Naval Space and Warfare (SPAWAR) Command PAS.  The required AtHoc PDIM software license subscriptions support compliance with the National Response Framework to ensure delivery of notifications to VA employees and contractors during emergency and crisis situations and maintain continuity of operations at all times.  The AtHoc PDIM software licenses are required to communicate with the Personnel Directory Information from SPAWAR, who hosts VA s accountability functionality to the VANS servers in Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Field Operations Regions 1 and 4.  The procurement will also include maintenance support services that include 24 hour per day, 7 days per week technical support, telephone support and on-site technical support, in addition to all software patches and upgrades.  Maintenance support services will ensure that AtHoc software remains operational.  The period of performance consists of a 12 month base period beginning December 27, 2016 through December 26, 2017, and one 12-month option period for software licenses and maintenance support.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in section eight of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for the required brand name AtHoc PDIM software licenses and maintenance support.  The renewal of these licenses and maintenance will provide VA the ability to continue the operation of the currently fielded VA PAS Helpdesk, VANS, and VA Integrated Operating Center (IOC) that all use AtHoc IWS Alert software to perform personnel emergency alerting and accountability.  VA PAS, VANS and IOC manage and monitor the emergency alerting and accountability of VA employees, contractors, affiliates and associates.  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) all utilize AtHoc s IWS Alert software for emergency notification purposes.  All employees and contractors in VA facilities use the system to alert and provide notification of safety.  Each Administration has their own emergency coordinators that use the system for this purpose.  Only the existing AtHoc IWS Alert software licenses supporting up to 640,000 users and the required AtHoc PDIM software licenses will insure interoperability and compatibility with the existing VA PAS, VANS and IOC infrastructures which consists of AtHoc IWS Alerting software.  The PDIM licenses allow SPAWAR to communicate with the VANS systems in Region 1 and Region 4.  No other vendor can provide the software that integrates with the VANS system.  No other vendors can supply a PDIM license that will communicate with the existing AtHoc IWS Alert software due to the proprietary code of the AtHoc software.  Furthermore, no other source other than an AtHoc authorized reseller can provide the required maintenance support requirements described herein, such as assistance via telephone support and on-site technical support, as well as all software patches and upgrades.  Also, the proprietary code is required to ensure the services provided on the items are properly configured.

Failure to obtain the aforementioned AtHoc license and maintenance support renewals will have a direct and significant negative impact for VA.  Per VA Directive 0325  Department of Veterans Affairs Personnel Accountability  and The National Security Presidential Directive 51, VA is required to maintain a state of readiness and provide accountability of and notification to employees during emergencies and times of crisis.  Effective real-time communication is crucial to protection of life and property for VA employees, contractors, affiliates, and associates.  Without the renewal of the existing AtHoc PDIM licenses and maintenance support, all transmissions and communication with VA staff will come to an immediate halt during a catastrophic emergency.  VHA, VBA, and NCA will no longer be able to ensure uninterrupted connectivity to VA PAS and VANS networks to provide personnel notifications for alerting and accountability purposes.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section eight of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  The VA determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required AtHoc software license and maintenance support renewals.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), the award notice for this action will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award.  Additionally, in accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2), this justification will be provided with the Request for Quote to eligible NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be more widely competed.  VA networking Subject Matter Experts regularly review industry trade publications and conduct internet research to ascertain if any other brand name software licenses and maintenance support are available to meet the requirements described herein.

8.  Market Research:  In August 2016, the Government s technical experts conducted market research to ascertain the ability of any other source, other than an AtHoc reseller, that can provide the aforementioned software licenses and maintenance support services.  Specifically, the Government s technical experts conducted web-based research on other potential sources, including Desktop Alert, Inc.; Everbridge; MIR3, Inc.; and Send Word Now.  The technical experts determined that none of these products can meet all of VA s interoperability and compatibility requirements with the existing VA PAS, VANS, and IOC infrastructures.  Additionally, only AtHoc, or its authorized resellers can access the proprietary source code in order to provide the required maintenance support.  Unauthorized providers do not have access to the proprietary data to be able to provide the required technical support, telephone support and on-site technical support, in addition to all software patches and upgrades.  AtHoc PDIM licenses are the only licenses that are compatible and interoperable with the existing currently fielded VA PAS, VANS, and IOC infrastructures.

Additional market research was conducted in September 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP Provider Lookup tool to determine whether the brand name AtHoc products are available from NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  The VA determined that there are several resellers of the brand name AtHoc products that hold current GWACs such that limited competition is anticipated.

9.  Other Facts:  None.

 (X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  
This is an injectable medication needed ASAP. The usual contracted item is on a back order, and this approved alternative via OM McKesson government source may run out of supply because everyone else is switching to using this medication.  This medication is used in direct patient care.  Privigen is a therapy that helps protect the health of patients with PI by supplying their immune system with antibodies to help prevent infections. ... In supplementation, IVIg therapy is used to provide protective antibodies to patients with immunodeficiencies.


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Contacted two other companies for prices, they were both higher in cost. Also Mckesson is a primary contracted vendor for VA hospitals and has an established distribution network for pharmaceuticals and has the ability to get us this product by the time required.Â  

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  1) Privigen 5 gram ordered by IHS (Government entity) 10/05/2016 $385 a unit PO IPMCNB17001, 2) Privigen 10 gram ordered by IHS (Government entity) 10/05/2016 $770 a unit PO IPMCNB17001, 3) Privigen 20 gram ordered by IHS (Government entity) 10/05/2016 $1540 a unit PO IPMCNB17001 for a total of $73,150.00 (Same pricing to the VAMC)

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Contacted two other companies for prices, they were both higher in cost.  Also McKesson is a primary contracted vendor for VA hospitals and has an established distribution network for pharmaceuticals and has the ability to get us this product by the time required.Â 

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  See #6

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  N/A.
