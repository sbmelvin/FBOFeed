<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for an Advanced X-ray Diffraction System for the analysis of clay minerals. The primary use of the instrument is for the crystallographic analysis of purified clay minerals, prepared as oriented films and randomly oriented powder mounts. A secondary use will be for the mineralogical analysis of bulk powdered geological samples. These analyses are necessary for a number of projects, including, for example, the development of a planetary minerals database and the examination of terrestrial clay-bearing sediments that are believed to be analogous to certain deposits on Mars. To fulfill this purpose it is crucial that the machine should have: 1)	Bragg-Brentano geometry 2)	The ability to analyze samples from at least 2 to 65 degrees two-theta  the angular range required in conjunction with X-ray radiation produced by a copper X-ray tube. 3)	The instrument sample holding system needs to be able accept clay films supported by glass and silicon plates or slides, in addition to holders suitable for powdered samples. It would also be advantageous if the machine had the option to incorporate and sample chamber for regulating environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and pressure). Bruker D8 Discover XRD system is an example of an instrument that meets these requirements; however this brand name is not required. Cost will include delivery and installation of Advanced X-ray Diffraction System. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this procurement. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Responses must include the following: name, address, and website address of firm, size of business; number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business listed above, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers for similar systems during the past three years (include contract numbers, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact -email and phone number). Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.

<DESC>This is published as sole source announcement under the statutory authority at 10 USC2304(c) (1), and regulatory authority at FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground-Tobyhanna Division, Tobyhanna, PA 18466 intends to negotiate and award a contract for the repair and overhaul of the following items on a sole source basis to Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434;   <br>  <br> The proposed contract is to provide the Test Equipment and related software, Tools, Training, Repair data, and Parts for the AN/PYQ-10 Simple Key Loader (SKL) to provide Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) the resources to develop test and repair capability to the module level.  The SKL is a ruggedized, hand-held, Personal Digital Assistant Device that is used by the Army, Navy, and Air Force as a key component of the National Security Agency's (NSA's) Electronic Key Management System.  The primary function of the SKL is to load a secure electronic key (Top-Secret, Secret, and Confidential) into End-Cryptographic Units to enable secure communications among tactical and strategic service networks. <br>  <br> The proposed source for this action is Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC).  SNC is the only source that has passed all of the required NSA testing, which is necessary to interface its product with the NSA-developed KOV-21 INFOSEC device. SNC is the only source that can integrate software and hardware and verify operability, using the test procedures that SNC developed and NSA approved.  SNC, as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the SKL, has unique expertise and knowledge of repair and testing of the SKL.  TYAD needs to acquire this expertise through training, purchasing of identical test equipment and test software, and failure and cost data that can only be provided by the OEM. <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide this service, you must respond within fifteen (15) days of this notice.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of man-portable communications capability for deployed ISAF liaison officer teams.
<p>Potential U.S. bidders must be pre-approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Please see Bidding Procedure for more information on&nbsp;the NATO ICB application process.</p>
<p>The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO Unclassified. However, for performance of the contract, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13589-OPL. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding shall be allowed.</p>
<p>REQUIEMENT</p>
<p>The man-portable communication capability to deployed ISAF liaison teams will provide a highly portable solution for connectivity into regions of Afghanistan where ISAF personnel may be required to operate and where provision of ISAF CIS connectivity and support may be limited or non-existent.</p>
<p>The purpose is to provide a highly portable CIS solution for use by designated ISAF personnel that will allow, in a single-person man-portable configuration, connectivity to and use of the Afghan Mission Network (AMN) from anywhere within the area of Afghanistan during all times of the year and employing the Functional Area Services (FAS) of that network.</p>
<p>The proposed CIS solutions will be referred to as the ISAF Man Portable AMN Capability (IMPAC) in order to</p>
<p>a. Place ISAF secure CIS assets into non-ISAF locations to support District and Provincial Development teams and Afghanistan National Security Force and Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) mentors and others.<br />b. Increase freedom of movement and high mobility to deployed ISAF liaison officers and to preclude the addition of ISAF static CIS footprints in GIRoA facilities.<br />c. Enhance the coordination connectivity of security Government development activities permitting connectivity back to the ISAF operational network and thus provide the full spectrum of networked command and control to support their field operations.<br />d. Permit those small numbers of still embedded liaison officers to remain connected to the AMN as required during high profile events while permitting the drawdown of all other support and end user equipment supporting that capability.</p>
<p>Ten kits are required as well as integration with static CIS infrastructure.</p>
<p>The project shall be implemented in two stages, consisting of implementation of an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) three months in duration, and implementation of a Final Operational Capability (FOC) two months in duration.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from the DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 25 February 2013<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in March 2013</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for April 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award is expected&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2013</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Infectious and Respiratory Dieseases, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), to Bioniquest Lab Services, Inc., 696 San Ramon Valley Blvd., Suite 346, Danville, California 94526-4022 to perform on-site laboratory service for equipment within CDC's laboratory at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30329-4018 <br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), "Only one source reasonable available to satisfy agency requirements." The work performed by the laboratory requires minimum downtime to ensure the quality of results, response to outbreaks, and production of reagents. Further, due to the size, location, and necessary decontamination procedures for moving the equipment, it is neither feasible nor efficient for the equipment to be moved for service; therfore, on-site maintenance is required. Operating under NAICS 81121, Bioniquest is the only small business vendor that can guarantee 4-hour service telephone response time and 24-hour on-site response time with a manufacturer certified technician that possesses a minimum of five (5) years of field service experience on instrumentation. The vendor guarnatees the use of manufacturer replacement parts, software upgrades, and travel and labor costs, all at no additional expense on both equipment and the computer associated with it. Further, the vendor's technicians are vaccinated for a range of diseases which may be encountered in the laboratory, thus reducing the potential expense or administrative burden of aquiring vaccinations for new vendors.<br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2013-54070, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: David Dombeck, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341, or via email at vwj8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.<br /><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services in the future.<br /><br />If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Bioniquest Lab Services, Inc., as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Palmetto GBA under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0002Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment).</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are: Idaho Technology (088J2). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance.</span></p>

FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC. This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance.

Only businesses that have been certified by the DOD, US/Canada Joint Certification Officer, and have a valid requirement may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the follow-on to NASAs SEWP (Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement) IV Procurement. SEWP contracts offer a wide range of advanced technology including tablets, desktops and servers; IT peripherals; network equipment; storage systems; security tools; software products; cloud based services; video conferencing systems and other IT and Audio-Visual products. Product based services such as installation, training, maintenance and warranty are also available through SEWP. As a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract, the SEWP contracts are utilized by all Federal Agencies. It is anticipated that SEWP V will award multiple commercial firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  This procurement is for 4 competition areas consisting of one Category A computer system group, and 3 Category B supporting equipment groups.  Each of the groups has specific requirements and functional tasks that must be met by the offerings in that group.  However, the potential usage of any group is broad and may be based on a variety of applications beyond the specific group definition. These groupings are to ensure that the Government has a sufficient set of the best available tools for given tasks.  The groupings do not imply either exclusive product offerings by the contractor nor do they restrict the Government from making best value judgments as to which group to use to meet their specific requirements. The contracts will be awarded by both Category and Group as follows: Category A (Computer Systems/Servers)  NAICS 334111		    Group A  Computer Based Systems Category B (Complementary Products)  NAICS 541519 Group B   Mass Storage Devices (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside) Group C   Server Support Devices/Multi-Functional Devices  (Small Business Set-Aside) Group D   Networking/Security/Video and Conference Tools The anticipated release date of the draft RFP is on or about February 8, 2013 with industry comments and inquiries due April 12, 2013. The draft RFP will be posted on-line with an interactive comment functionality.  All comments and inquiries and Government responses will be posted through the on-line draft RFP.  Instructions on how to access the draft RFP will be included in the release announcement. The anticipated release date of the final RFP will be early Summer 2013 with proposals due late Summer 2013. The anticipated award date is May 1, 2014. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	 . The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA Business Opportunities page is http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=   .

This ROSES NRA covers all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling, and analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, stratospheric balloon, suborbital rocket, and commercial reusable rocket investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space missions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to SMD missions; development of techniques for and the laboratory analysis of both extraterrestrial samples returned by spacecraft, as well as terrestrial samples that support or otherwise help verify observations from SMD Earth system science missions; determination of atomic and composition parameters needed to analyze space data, as well as returned samples from the Earth or space; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; development of integrated Earth system models; development of systems for applying Earth science research data to societal needs; and development of applied information systems applicable to SMD objectives and data. Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this ROSES NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intraagency transfers depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is four years, although a few programs may specify shorter or longer (maximum of five years) periods. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on the number or teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds.

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and corporate experience information, along with a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.
  The tradeoff process is anticipated to be used for this acquisition.  The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.

	Factor 1  Corporate Experience
	Factor 2  Technical Approach/Management Approach
	Factor 3  Safety

  Technical factors (Factors 1-3) and the past performance/performance confidence assessment factor (Factor 4) combined are approximately equal to price. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

 If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The period of performance will be extended approximately 7 months.<br /><br />The prospective contractor shall provide support for Naval Research Advisory Committee (NRAC) Program Office (Code OONR). OONR is responsible for overseeing Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) compliance, administrative, logistical and technical support of the Naval Research Advisory Committee. The Naval Research Advisory Committee (NRAC) is an independent civilian scientific advisory group dedicated to providing objective analyses in the areas of science, research and development. By its recommendations, the NRAC calls attention to important issues and presents Navy management with alternative courses of action. It is the senior scientific advisory group to the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Chief of Naval Research.<br /><br />ONR intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Jorge Scientific Corporation because the services are a follow-on from a current contract award and awarding to another source would cause unacceptable delays/gaps in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract. It is the Government's intent to compete the services and award a new contract no later than 30 Aug 2013.

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2. THIS COMPETITIVE ACTION IS BEING PROCURED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
<p>The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) seek to establish a Fill and Finish Manufacturing Network (FFMN) that facilitates medical countermeasure (MCM) and ensures domestic pharmaceutical1 surge fill and finish capacity. These fill and finish U.S. based Facilities are expected to provide filling and finishing capabilities for influenza vaccines and other public health emergency products to address national security and to augment public health needs on a cost- effective, reliable, and sustainable basis. HHS/BARDA requires the services of Contractor(s) to provide filling and finishing services to other commercial partners under contract to the U.S. Government (USG) for filling and finishing of influenza vaccines and possibly for pharmaceuticals against CBRN threats or to support fill finishing for other drug shortages. The work performed at the FFMN will be coordinated and integrated by HHS/BARDA with programs from other USG agencies to provide long-term solutions that address the medical consequences of currently known and unknown threats. Members of the U.S.-based FFMN are expected to provide fill and finish capabilities for pandemic influenza vaccines to address national security and to augment public health needs on a cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable basis.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to create the necessary contractual, business and regulatory relationships between the USG, Offerors and the organizations that hold the license for pandemic influenza product(s) to meet the stated HHS objective of having 600 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine available in 6 months, post HHS declaration of a Public Health Emergency, in response to a pandemic.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the majority of the time leading up to the fill and finish of 600 million doses will be occupied by viral seed selection and preparation, vaccine bulk drug substance manufacture, reagent development and bulk product release. Nine weeks are anticipated to be required, upon availability of formulated material, for several offering organizations to respond in parallel to the filling of pandemic influenza vaccine in finished multi-dose vials with complete internal testing. In the case of a pandemic, these relationships are designed to provide the USG with access to the majority of U.S.-based filling. To accomplish this goal the USG seeks to create a robust network of fill and finish service providers that can readily be accessed in the event of a pandemic. During non-pandemic periods, a warm-base effort may be executed with Fill and Finish Network members to ensure their capabilities are maintained in a state of readiness.</p>
<p>Minimum Mandatory Eligibility Criteria:<br /><br />1. U.S.-based filling facility: The Offeror shall demonstrate written evidence that the Offeror has unencumbered access to a US based filling facility which will be proposed for this solicitation and will be used for the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>2. Written evidence the Offeror has filled an FDA licensed/approved sterile product within the last two (2) years: Written evidence the Offeror shall have proficiency in filling and finishing pharmaceutical products in single and multi-dose packaging. This shall be demonstrated by the Offeror having filled a FDA licensed/approved sterile product within the last two (2) years at the facility being proposed; or a Bulk Influenza vaccine manufacturer who has manufactured an FDA licensed influenza vaccine, and has a partnership with a company/contractor who has filled an FDA licensed/approved sterile product within the last two (2) years in their US-based facility which is being proposed for this solicitation (provide written evidence).<br />3. Written capability statement for pandemic influenza vaccine production. The statement describes the current capacity and proposed additional capacity anticipated to be augmented, including additional resources if needed, as part of this solicitation. The statement shall include number of doses (10-dose multi-dose vials), time frame required, and level of effort (additional resources) required to fulfill the additional doses. For the purposes of this solicitation, the maximum time frame to provide released doses is 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The initial work during the contract will be the technology transfer and may include modifications, if necessary, of existing equipment within pharmaceutical fill and finish facilities to meet FDA and cGMP standards for clinical, and Phase 3 Clinical, Commercial-scale fill and finish needs of the USG. All facilities established under the FFMN shall ensure the ability to provide, on an emergency basis, the agreed upon number of doses of pandemic influenza vaccines in finished multi-dose vials with complete internal testing within12-weeks. The technology transfer process should also include support to the vaccine owner for submitting a license amendment for this new alternate fill/finish site.</p>
<p>Once work within the facilities are completed and validated, the USG may issue task/delivery orders to maintain or utilize the FFMN for its intended purpose. The ability of the USG to solicit these services via a Task/ Delivery Order will be predicated by the Contractor's timing to bring those specific aspects of their fill and finish facility online. The following elements shall be included in an Offeror's SOW:<br /><br />Objective 1</p>
<p>Augment Current US-based Fill and Finish Capacity:<br />The Offeror shall expand domestic pharmaceutical filling and finishing capacity for advanced development influenza vaccines and other public health emergency products at pilot and commercial scale. The technology transfer and licensure amendment of such a pandemic influenza vaccine shall be executed as part of this objective. Fulfillment of this objective may include purchasing of change parts, additional equipment, and minor renovations to supplement and re-qualify an existing fill finish facility. Examples of acceptable activities may include upgrading and re-qualifying a previously obsolete filling line, replacing equipment such as a 5-head filler with a 10-head filler in order to increase throughput, adding automated inspection to replace a manual inspection process, and purchase of spare parts or dedicated parts in order to reduce changeover time between products. Construction of a new facility, retro-fitting of a current facility or facility addition is not within scope of this objective.<br />The Offeror may pursue their own relationship to identify an FDA licensed or Phase 3 influenza vaccine candidate for use in their facility. Preference will be given to Contractors who are in an established BLA for influenza vaccines or partnering with a vaccine candidate that is at least at the Phase 3 stage. If the contractor does not secure such a candidate, the USG may introduce a pandemic influenza candidate(s) to the Offeror and encourage an agreement between a pandemic influenza vaccine candidate and the Offeror to meet this Objective. Future task Order Requests (TOR) may require establishment of new partnerships.</p>
<p>Objective 2</p>
<p>Provide Fill and Finish Services (Non-surge):<br />Offerors shall provide fill and finish services that include the capability to process clinical investigational lots, engineering lots, process validation lots, and commercial-scale lots. Services may include, but are not limited to: technology transfer, analytical testing, process optimization, process validation, formulation, filling, labeling and packaging, and distribution.</p>
<p>Services may be provided to support the fill and finish of pharmaceuticals including parenteral drug products, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, antitoxins, bacterial or viral vector-based products, and attenuated/killed virus vaccines. As per the USG requirement, these liquid, lyophilized, or powder drug products may be filled and finished as prefilled syringes or sprayers, single dose or multi-dose vials.</p>
<p>The funding for these future task orders is separate from the funding being allocated to create this Fill Finish Manufacturing Network. As the task orders are product specific, the separate funding for the future task orders may include materials, spare parts, equipment, staffing, fees, etc. that are within the task order scope and necessary to complete the required task.</p>
<p><br />Objective 3</p>
<p>Provide Fill and Finish Surge Capacity:<br />Offerors shall have augmented the existing vaccine fill and finish infrastructure surge capacity for pandemic influenza, emerging infectious disease, and other threats of known and unknown origin during a public health emergency, as described in Objective 1. Once a public health emergency has been declared, the Offerors shall formulate, fill and finish bulk lots of pandemic influenza vaccine provided by the USG within 12 weeks in 10- dose multi-dose (5 ml or 10 ml) vials based on a USG task order. The government estimates the FFMN contractors will be given approximately 3 months notification that bulk pandemic influenza vaccine will need to be formulated and filled at the contractors' site. This estimate is dependent upon the bulk manufacturing and potency assay/calculations which are needed before formulation and filling can occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, the USG anticipates that there may be other life saving products being produced for commercial needs at the selected contractor facilities. The delivery schedule for pandemic influenza vaccine will be negotiated between the USG and the contractors on a case by case basis to ensure supply of all priority life saving products is maintained at appropriate levels.</p>
<p><br />Offerors will be required to submit a detailed Statement of Work to address the objectives as part of their submission.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) pre-proposal conference will be held during the solicitation period. Potential Offerors and any subcontractors are encouraged to attend. HHS/BARDA will be hosting a pre-proposal conference whose date and other public information will be posted on www.medicalcountermeasures.gov and www.fbo.gov in the Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>Multiple contracts may be awarded as a result of this RFP. Contract(s) awarded under this solicitation are anticipated to be IDIQ type with a 10 year period of performance. Small Businesses interested in a teaming or partnering arrangement are highly encouraged to contact Offerors identified on http://www.FedBizOpps.gov for subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals to Establish a Fill and Finish Manufacturing Network will be issued 15 to 30 days after the release of this synopsis. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps.

<DESC>Executive Summary
 Virtual learning initiatives have become increasingly prevalent in the last few years, as the Veterans Administration (VA) has looked for innovative ways to utilize the benefits of technology and increase the effectiveness of education.  Web-based classrooms offer a paradigm shift in the field of learning that provides high speed access to knowledge and information where training can occur anywhere resulting in substantial travel and time cost savings.  Simply put, virtual learning brings learning to people.
More importantly, it is critical that the VA supports a culture where application of new skills acquired from a training event is transferred to the worksite.  Linking learning to worksite performance requires a high degree of learner interactivity during the learning process.  Web-based classrooms offer an environment where interactivity among participants, facilitators and content experts is available.  Through this platform, training is enhanced through encouraging participants' active reflection on content and problem solving via facilitated discussion, action learning projects, coaching, mentoring, and continuous peer interactions.
Web-based classrooms which are virtual, interactive learning environments offer online training that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.  They are typically hosted websites designed to manage or administer various aspects of learning: delivery of learning materials, learner tracking, assessment and evaluation functions and support student and faculty communication and collaboration.  
Virtual Collaborative environments enhance and extend the current capabilities of existing Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) environments.  Enhancements include the ability to conduct distributed real-time learning, support small group learning activities in a virtual environment, and record and make available recordings classroom presentations for viewing at a later time.
The Midwest Mountain Veterans Engineering Resource Center (MWM VERC) has developed web-based classrooms for a number of VA programs and hosted them in a Blackboard Learn environment.  The VLE system is hosted on Blackboard servers using the Blackboard Learn and Collaborate software.  The MWM VERC currently has a 1000 user license.  Several of our classes are based on a methodology called "Flipping the Classroom" where our presentations are split into 1 to 10 minute videos which the students review prior to signing into a virtual collaborative learning session.  The students use the collaborative session to interactively work on exercises.  The VERC uses Microsoft Powerpoint and Adobe Captivate on PC's and other Apps on IPads to develop the videos.
Although our current VLE is Blackboard based the MWM VERC is interested in determining what additional capabilities and approaches may be available for Web-Based learning environments.  Technology is advancing at a furious rate and the VA/VERC would like to leverage all new technology available for a Web Based learning environment.  However, the VERC will continue to develop and deploy training media using "Flip the Classroom" methodologies.  The goal of the VERC is to provide a 100% virtual training environment that allows real time interaction between the student and instructor.  This environment should have the look and feel of a face-to-face classroom setting.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation to identify garment cut and sew manufacturers experienced in manufacturing the current Army Combat Uniform (ACU) with interest in participating in a permethrin treated fabric cut and sew trial. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is interested in locating manufacturers currently cutting and sewing Army Combat Uniforms or with previous experience in manufacturing the garment according to specifications, that would be interested in participating in a permethrin treated fabric cut and sew trial.  Ideally the facility will have an isolated production line dedicated to ACU production.  The facility must be willing to allow access for the Government and contracted environmental sampling companies to collect environmental samples during regular ACU production with standard Nylon Cotton (NyCo) material (baseline) and then while using a permethrin impregnated material (trial).  Work area samples to be taken may include air collection in and around the facility and equipment as well as surface swabs.  Additionally, employees of the facility may be asked to wear small, lightweight air sampling pumps during the manufacturing process to measure the amount of permethrin present in the air in the immediate worker area.  The air sampling pumps clip onto the employee's belt and will not interfere with the employee's ability to complete their work.  Hand swabs of employees' skin (such as hands and arms) may also be included in determining the amount of permethrin released into the work environment during the manufacturing process. Results of any personal sampling can be made available and provided to the respective employee for entry into their medical records.  Facilities must be willing to cease production of the untreated ACUs in the trial area during the permethrin fabric trial. <br>  <br> Information provided should include the manufacturer's ability to provide an operational and isolated production line, capabilities to produce first quality ACUs, facility diagrams (to include layout, square footage,  location and number of air circulation fans, types of filters etc.), number of cutting and sewing operations and personnel per operation, description of all identified activities/processes that employees will be involved in for each work area during manufacturing, shift length and number of shifts being run, facility air exchange rate, location and operational status of any local exhaust ventilation (such as an exhaust fan with flexible hose/elephant trunk attachment), the number of uniforms required to ramp up and fill the ACU production area to 80%-100% capacity for at least 2 days for a 24 hour operation or 4 days for operations less than 24 hours and the number of days required for the trial ramp-up.  <br>     <br> Manufacturers should also provide a cost estimate to cut and sew the uniforms. Treated fabric will be provided by the Government.  Cost estimates should consider all aspects of the assembly process excluding the fabric.  <br>  <br> Information submitted shall include: 1. Company name and address. 2. Point of contact, telephone, fax, Web address, and e-mail address. 3. Relevant company background/experience including an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed, availability and description of special facilities required to perform the above study, a statement regarding industry security clearance, and any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area. 4. A schedule for when the facility may be available to conduct this study.  <br>  <br> This Market Survey is for information purposes only and does NOT bind the U.S. Government to any type of contracting action, or guarantee any purchase by the U.S. Government.  <br>  <br> Submittals: Information about a particular brand/product should be submitted in electronic (MS Word) format by 4:00 pm EST on 22 February 2013 by e-mail to Ms. Melynda Perry at melynda.perry.civ@mail.mil. If submitting via e-mail, put  quote mark RFI - USARAFP248 quote mark  in the e-mail subject line.

	c. Master Key level for use within service zones as needed.
	d. Individual Key level.
2.	The intent of the CNVAMC is to maintain the integrity of the current doors, handles and door jambs, thus only the locking cores will be replaced.

<DESC>The purpose of this procurement is to create a second Center to Improve Project Performance (CIPP) whose primary mission is to provide technical assistance to OSEP-funded projects on their formative and summative project evaluations.  CIPP has the following goals: (1) to inform and promote high quality formative and summative project evaluations and performance reporting as conducted by OSEP-funded projects or their external evaluators; (2) to improve the consistency, objectivity and rigor of OSEP's 3+2 evaluations of projects funded at approximately $500,000 or more annually; and (3) to complete the work of the first CIPP on the summative evaluations of eleven projects funded from FY 2008-FY 2011.<br />
<p>The general TA task in this procurement is expanded to include the development of up to 2 broad-based TA activities per year (in addition to an annual conference presentation at the OSEP Project Director's Meeting) that can provide evaluation information to a large number of interested parties.  Moreover, intensive TA for OSEP's larger investments shall continue for this procurement, but the focus of future work with these projects will shift from improving summative evaluation to formative evaluations.  This includes the projects' participation in the 3+2 process that evaluates the progress of OSEP's large discretionary investments in implementing their activities.  This award will also require the contractor to improve the rigor and consistency of the 3+2 process in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this is a technical assistance contract.  The contractor does not conduct the evaluations or collect evaluation data; though, in order to complete some tasks described herein, the contractor may analyze evaluation data collected by a grantee.  The anticipated period of performance for contract is a base year with 4 option years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to submit capability statements.  Statements shall comply with the attached instructions and must be submitted electronically to Jonathan Bettis (Jonathan.Bettis@ed.gov) and, as a cc, Cynthia Duncan (Cynthia.Duncan@ed.gov) no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 6, 2013.  Please note that the instructions include an invitation to provide comments on the draft Performance Work Statement and to identify any competition barriers.</p>

<p><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />DEACIDIFICATION OF LIBRARY PAPER VOLUMES AND UNBOUND PAPER SHEETS PLAN</strong><br /><br />The Preservation Directorate, (PD) Library Services within the Library of Congress (LOC) is conducting market research for deacidification treatment  on a mass production level of library paper volumes and unbound paper sheets. Offerors may propose any deacidification process(es) providing the process meets the technical requirements specified in the SOW. This sources sought notice is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists regarding a potential future solicitation. This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for potential offerors to express interest and provide information regarding their relevant capabilities. Information submitted in response to this notice may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research of an organization's capability.<br /><br />The Preservation Directorate, Library Services anticipates awarding a multi year firm fixed price IDIQ  contract with a base year and option years. <br />The Preservation Directorate seeks capability statements from all sources. <br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement Instructions</strong><br />In response to the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the (PD) hereby solicits capability statements from eligible contractors. These statements shall be no longer than 5 pages (single-spaced, with a minimum of one-inch margins and 12 point font).   Contractors should include science demonstrably based on scientifically proven technical data, knowledge of the chemistry and physics involved and that can operate safely at full production and meet the toxicological and environmental standards set out in this solicitation. Appendix should be no longer than 25 pages.  The science documentation of process which should include results from testing to document both positive and adverse limitations will not be counted as part of the 5 pages of the capability statement. <br /><br />The capability statement should describe the process and value of the treatment process, the  expertise of key personnel, and the capability of the company to provide the necessary capacity for services as stated in the draft SOW and below. The capability statement should describe the qualifications and experience of key personnel, as well as related corporate experience and capacity, in each of the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull;	Have extensive knowledge, and experience in successfully neutralizing the acid in paper-based materials both bound and in sheets and be able to scientifically demonstrate both the value of the process and low adverse effects on treated materials. <br /><br />&bull;	Have the capacity to successfully treat bound and sheet materials yearly in a range of 168,000 to 250,000 volumes and 800,000 to 1 million sheets. <br /><br />&bull;	Have experience working with organizations that have required successful treatment of library paper-based materials both bound and in sheets with successful test results that show extending the life of paper for a minimum of 300 years without adverse side affects to the materials and provide documentation of successful treatment that both neutralizes acid and adds buffer.<br /><br />&bull;	Have the capacity to provide on site at the Library of Congress contractor personnel to select, document, create item records if needed in the ILS, pack, ship and document return of items and return treated items to their original location. Also have the capacity to treat on site those sheets deemed too value to be shipped off site.</p>
<p>Appendix should include:<br />-Description of the deacidification chemistry, process, and existing and planned facilities owned or to be owned by the parties, as well as information on any toxicological or environmental impact of the process and/or any of the bi-products, and available data concerning the occupational safety of the process operation.<br /><br />-Documentation of laboratory analyses on processed books and manuscripts from current customers.  Analyses should include pH measurements, tests for alkaline reserve, completeness of deacidification, and extension of life of the papers as measured by accelerated aging, as well as scanning electron microscopy and any other tests useful for establishing the effectiveness of the process.&nbsp;<br /> <br />-Evaluation of volumes and sheet materials for any process-related damage(s) or other unacceptable side-effects on the treated materials, such as process-induced odors in treated materials; blocking, cockling, tearing, staining, discoloration, or yellowing of paper; bleeding or feathering of inks or others media; warping of binding boards; degradation and/or other chemical changes in book cloths, buckrams, or other covering materials; degradation of binding or other adhesives or damage to sewn or adhesive binding structures; loosening or damage to labels; excessive chemical deposits on covers, paper stock, photographic images or other non-porous materials such as coated or super-calendered paper; and damage to plastic components of books and other treated objects. <br /><br />-Demonstrate processing turn-around times to determine whether books and other treated materials would be returned and refiled for use within a period of time that is deemed reasonable to the Library.  Even though a process has technical merit, the Library may choose not to evaluate and test it if, in addition to an acceptable time for selecting, shipping, treating, returning, and refiling the materials, the process requires, for example, several additional days of pre-drying and several days or weeks for rehumidifying, airing, or removing process-related odors from treated materials. <br /> <br />-Demonstrate capability to treat on site of customers those sheets too valuable to be removed from customer premises.<br /><br />-Provide available data on the effectiveness of the process in extending the life of papers, providing complete deacidification, and depositing adequate, uniform permanent alkaline reserve.<br /><br />-Cite any documentation of evaluations, analyses, and findings in a written report made available to the preservation community for their use in making preservation decisions.<br />-A list of customers that are using and/or other interested parties who are evaluating their deacidification services.</p>

<CONTACT>Michelle Yates
<DESC>Pursuant to the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, Public Law 105-391, the Director of the National Park Service may award non-competitive temporary concession contracts for consecutive terms not to exceed three years in the aggregate. Through a lease held by National Park Foundation, the National Park Service has provided non-motorized boat rental and storage services in Rock Creek Park on the Georgetown Waterfront since transferred from the District of Columbia to the National park Service in 1999. The Service anticipates awarding a temporary concession contract for non-motorized boat rental and storage services. The Service may award one temporary concession contract and by law, the term of temporary concession contract may be one year, two years, or three years or any combination thereof, but not to exceed 3 years. The National Capital Region (NCR) issues this REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ) to determine if an interested operator is qualified to provide non-motorized boat rental and storage services as described in the draft Temporary Concession Contract, including all Exhibits, that accompanies this RFQ. The Service is issuing this RFQ to obtain information about the experience and financial capability of entities seeking to provide the non-motorized boat rental and storage services. While responses do not constitute offers, the Service plans to rely, in part, on the information provided as a basis for selecting the temporary concessioner. The prospectus and a synopsis of the business opportunity will be available on the National Park Service Concessions website at: This RFQ does not constitute a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP), nor does this RFQ constitute an offer, either expressed or implied.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
The purpose of this procurement is to provide technical support to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, in amending, developing, and implementing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits and Clean Water Act (CWA) regulations. Technical support is expected to include professional program managers, engineers, scientists, information specialists, statisticians, and administrative services with experience in NPDES permitting and CWA regulations. The majority of the work emphasizes requirements related to work in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water; however this work may be available for use by other organizations within the EPA subject to the capacity and permission. All work required under this contract shall be defined in written work assignments issued by the EPA Contracting Officer (CO). The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will review all of the contractor analyses.
The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small businesses with the capability to perform all or a portion of the requirements defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for potential small businesses sources.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services with a size standard of $14 Million.
All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen (15) pages, and no smaller than 12 point font.  The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience, and past performance in each of the areas included in the paragraph below.  Additionally, interested parties should include a discussion of the capability of their accounting system or ability to implement a cost accounting system required of a cost-type contract.  Previous experience with cost-type government contracts should be discussed.  Interested parties should describe their ability to provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the efforts required by the draft PWS.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.
Tasks anticipated in this procurement include: 
?   QUALITY ASSURANCE ?   TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR REVISIONS AND ADMINISTRATION OF NPDES PERMITS ?   TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR AMENDING AND DEVELOPING CWA REGULATIONS ?   IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT OF NEW OR REVISED PERMITS AND/OR REGULATIONS ?   OUTREACH AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT ?   LOGISTICAL SUPPORT ?   DATA COLLECTION  ?   COMPLIANCE AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS ?   PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS ?   PREPARATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATORY RECORDS
The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick-turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the Office of Water.
The proposed contract will have a base period consisting of 12 months with four (4) option periods of 12 months each, for a total potential period of performance of five (5) years.  Total maximum level of effort for this five year period of performance is 50,000 direct labor hours.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed-fee/level-of-effort contract will result from this solicitation.
The current projected start date of the contract is September 1, 2013.  The RFP will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number SOL-CI-13-00017.  It may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov).  The direct link URL is http://www.epa.gov/oam/solam.htm.  All responsible sources who submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to check FedBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available after March 1, 2013.
Due to the nature of the PWS requirements, it is anticipated that interested parties with the expertise to perform this work could also have relationships (e.g. a parent/subsidiary/sister company affiliation or an existing contractual relationship), which presents the potential for significant organizational conflicts of interest.  It is the EPA?s contention that a significant organizational conflict of interest would exist if award were to be made to firm within the following groups:
?   firms within the regulated community that discharge processed water or which provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water;
 ?   firms that manufacture/sell/import water treatment chemicals and/or equipment (including point-of-use/point-of-entry devices;
?   firms that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control for regulated industries;
?   firms that act in consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, firms trying to overturn or circumvent the regulations which are the intended outcome of this contract;
?   firms that own or operate community water and/or wastewater systems.
Firms that are directly included in the entities described above would have clear conflicts which would be difficult for the agency to avoid, mitigate or neutralize.  However, some consulting firms that may have affiliates or subsidiaries that are part of those entities could, with proper disclosure and appropriate action, avoid, mitigate, and neutralize the potential conflict of interest.  Likewise, firms that have business or financial interests in those entities may also present actual or potential conflicts of interest concerns, which with proper disclosure and appropriate action may be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized.  None of these firms are restricted from submitting a capability statement to indicate interest in this upcoming solicitation.  
EPA reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner EPA determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party shall avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response. However, if an interested party shall submit such information, the information shall be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party shall provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary. EPA shall review said information and safeguard it accordingly.  The Government shall not pay for any information that is provided in response to this announcement, nor shall it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
Interested parties should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to (Brad Heath, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268-0001, or heath.brad@epa.gov) no later than February 7, 2013. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis.

<CONTACT>Mark C. Green, Email mark.c.green@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Product Manager, Combat Support Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), is seeking information from commercial sources to satisfy its requirement for a Crew Protection Kit (CPK) for the Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF). The CPK shall be configured as a removable "plug and play" cab which provides a minimum of STANAG Level I protection. <br />The Marine Corps is currently procuring LCRTF's from Kalmar RT LLC. The approved acquisition objective for the LCRTF is 799. Approximately 100 CPK's are planned for procurement. After conducting market research, it is anticipated that the Marine Corps will release a Request for Proposals (RFP) leading to the award of a fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the CPK. <br />Balancing the various CPK characteristics will be essential to the development of a successful armor solution. The following are some of the characteristics that shall be considered and incorporated; level of protection, operator visibility and overall human systems integration, weight, and commonality of interior cab components to that of the commercial cab. The culminating challenge is development of a CPK that will meet each of the requirements while avoiding or at least minimizing the performance degradation of the forklift. To evaluate the affect the CPK will have on the forklift, the Government will be requiring a System Impact Assessment as part of the RFP.<br />To allow interested sources to view and assess the LCRTF, the Marine Corps intends to schedule site visits to be conducted at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia during the week of 22 to 25 January 2013 (tentative). The intent is to allow companies to obtain the necessary information to fully understand the needs of the Marine Corps to increase their ability to respond to the upcoming RFP. <br />RFI responses must be submitted to MCSC no later than 4:00 PM EST 18 December 2012. Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed twelve (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Responses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New. Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "LCRTF Crew Protection Kit RFI Response". <br />Such responses should at a minimum provide the following information:<br />1. Written confirmation of intent to participate in the future LCRTF CPK procurement; include size and status information regarding your business; <br />2. Estimated pricing to provide the LCRTF CPK; sufficient detail should be provided to explain the basis for such estimate; <br />3. Information explaining your capability to manufacture and delivery the LCRTF CPK; this should include an estimate of your notional delivery schedule; listing of key teaming partners and subcontractors and their various roles; and<br />4. Explanation as to your specific design for the LCRTF CPK.<br />Based on a review of RFI responses, the Government will contact potential sources to schedule site visits as addressed above. <br />This is only a Request for Information. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 

Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified a requirement to retain a highly skilled Contractor to provide an objective and independent assessment of software product implementations.

B5.1   PURPOSE

The Chief Business Office (CBO), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking professional services for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) support to provide an objective and independent assessment of software product implementations (and related processes) throughout the project lifecycle.  In addition, to facilitate early detection and correction of errors, enhances management insight into risks and mitigates the risks that a project will not meet its goals in terms of project performance, scope, schedule, and budget.

B5.2   BACKGROUND

B5.2.1   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is one of the world's largest health care delivery organizations. As part of an integrated strategy to provide veterans with timely, respectful, and efficient service, the Chief Business Office (CBO), Member Services devotes its attention on the enrollment, eligibility, and contact management elements within the VA's Health Care System.  

B5.2.2 The VA provides eligibility and enrollment determination and income verification services for veterans through the Income Verification Division and Enrollment Eligibility Division within the Health Eligibility Center.  The CBO, Systems Management office provides consultative services to Member Services' initiatives that facilitate the access of care to veteran's benefits and services.  Systems Management defines and implements business initiatives and programs, provides business analysis, integration of business practices and information systems, and coordination of business and system processes deployments.  

B5.2.3   In general, veterans seek health care at VA expense and obtain such care at VA facilities.  The Income Verification Division and Enrollment Eligibility Division provide the VA Medical Centers with accurate verification and eligibility decisions in order to collect copayments from veterans for care.  A veteran's means test status and priority group are determined based on pension guidelines provided by law.  Various VA Policies and Directives have been written to provide additional interpretation.

B5.2.4   The VHA Chief Business Office (CBO), Systems Management has developed a comprehensive set of requirements to outline a vision for the future of Member Services. Systems Management is managing multiple programmatic enhancements to Income Verification Matching to provide a stronger integration with the Enrollment System in order to meet both long-term needs as well as interim requirements.  These enhancements will not only provide support to the Enrollment and Income Verification process, but components under the Veterans Relationship Management Program, Veterans Transportations Services, Veterans Point of Service (Kiosks), and Legislative changes. 

B5.3   OBJECTIVES

The purpose of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Member Services is to give the customer an opportunity to test the application. UAT will simulate a production environment and allow the validation of the requirements outlined in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). UAT is a method to improve the quality and effectiveness of the product by determining if the system is acceptable and capable of delivering accurate, timely information and satisfactory service to VHA users. As part of User Acceptance Plan, the UAT team will validate end-to-end business functionality to assess whether the application performs to a customer defined acceptable level of application functionality and stability.

B5.4    SCOPE

There will be a total of 3 Releases and two separate UAT's will be performed in the base year and 1 UAT in option year 1. The contractor will be responsible developing the test plan, writing user acceptance test scripts and for assisting the USERS in executing test scenarios, which will exercise the following aspects of the application:

Level 1: The integration of components of the required systems; inclusive of testing for defects, coding errors, and usability.  

Level 2: To assure the complete system has been delivered.  In this level of testing, the business owner is looking to guarantee components/interfaces have not been left out and/or the system conforms to the specified use case requirements. 

Level 3: To assure the system meets the critical business requirements, such as end-to-end business functionality, volume, and stress testing.  Users of the system with the support of the contractor will perform tests, which analysts and developers have derived from the requirements gathered from the business as well as test scenarios written by users. 
 The contractor will lead UAT team in the evaluation of the application by conducting user functionality tests, which consists of creating and executing test cases against the application.  The test results will be used to determine whether the following items are included in the system:
"	Required attributes/functionality are present 
"	Test cases in the required system are implemented 
"	Menus, screens, reports, system interfaces are present as specified and behave as documented and expected
"	Interfaces to external systems work effectively 
"	Specified processing algorithms are implemented correctly
"	End to end business processes work appropriately
"	Requirements and rules are appropriate and complete thereby meeting the needs of the business
"	Roles-based usage works accordingly
Approximate total number of UAT test scenarios and test cases/scripts expected to be generated by the contractor:

"	Approximately 40 use cases that include an average of 4 scenarios each.  Would expect more than 1 per scenario per use case 
"	Approximately 36 workflow use cases that include 1 scenario per use case.
"	Approximately 36 workflow use cases that include an average of 3 scenarios each.
"	Approximately 25 correspondence use cases.
"	Approximately 11 different scenarios within RAS where a workflow item may be created.
"	Approximately 24 different scenarios within Claims Processing where a workflow item may be created.
"	The numbers above represent an "atomic" approach to testing of requirements and does not consider scripts needed to test system integration.

Approximate total number of critical business requirements for the health claims systems against which test scenarios and test cases/scripts will be built and tested

"	Approximately 300 "features" defined in each BRD.
"	Approximately 960 requirements to be tested (40 use cases X 4 scenarios X 6 steps).
"	Approximately 500 rules to be tested.

 UAT testing will take place at the Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, Georgia and will be expected to last 20 working days.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS

Veterans Health Administration 
Chief Business Office 
Systems Management 
(VHA CBO SM)

Workflow Management Services



Date: November 30, 2011

?

Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Chief Business Office (CBO) Member Services
Systems Management
Workflow Management Services
1.	BACKGROUND
The Chief Business Office (CBO) is responsible for a broad range of business activities associated with health care benefit delivery. These activities occur both at the national and local medical facility level and are governed by statute and policy. The CBO is responsible for developing the business processes supporting the statute and policy governing VHA business programs. In addition, CBO is responsible for the timely and appropriate resolution of veteran inquiries and cases.
The Contractor shall provide services to define, create, and maintain a workflow management system using the workflow engine BizFlow (http://www.handysoft.com/) to manage tasks within the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Income Verification Division (IVD), Eligibility and Enrollment Division (EED), Business Services Division (BSD) and Chief Business Office Systems Management (CSM). Most of these workflow/work load management processes are currently managed using multiple databases, spreadsheets, and applications. The Contractor shall also provide BiZFlow training.
2.	SCOPE OF WORK
CBO Member Services will utilize the workflow engine as a tool to improve and streamline operations. The Contractor shall identify and analyze appropriate applications, databases, and services required to ensure the implementation fully incorporates components such as Identity Management Services, Content Management Systems, Documentation Services, and Web Services. 
IVD uses Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to manage their workload. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to assign, track, manage, close and report on all case types within IVD. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing Enrollment Database (EBD aka IVM 2.9) infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes (such as Appeals management). Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs.
EED has two Microsoft Access databases to manage workload; the Workload Reporting and Productivity (WRAP) application manages Enrollment and Eligibility staff workload; and the Caregiver Tracking Application (CAT) manages Medical Center, Enrollment, Call Center (Health Resource Center), and the Health Administration Center staff who provide support to Caregivers. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to assign, track, manage, close and report on all case types within EED. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing Enrollment System (ES aka ESR) infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes. Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs.
The BSD mailroom has been processing correspondence since 2005 using Opex scanners and imaging software to convert into an appropriate format for extraction, retrieval and indexing. These images are then converted to a readable format (optical character recognition, OCR) for further processing and distribution. The images are stored on disk and tapes, and also made available for viewing to the mailroom, EED, and IVD staff through their desktops. The Contractor shall provide analysis and services to implement a workflow management process to manage, assign, track, close and report on all correspondence cases within BSD. The purpose is to efficiently collect work tracking information without requiring dual entry, to seamlessly interface with existing imaging (Opex, http://www.opex.com/) and mailroom applications infrastructure, and allow for flexibility in modifying existing workflow processes and setting up new workflow processes. Upon completion, the workflow processes shall enhance operational efficiencies and provide a reduction in operating costs. 
CSM team members employ specialized knowledge; skills and experience that help reduce a project's level of risk and thereby increase its likelihood of success. The suite of CSM tools improves a project's probability of success by building on what has proven to be successful. Project management processes (e.g., risk management, requirements development, project planning, configuration management, and project monitoring and control) are tailored to fit the size and scope of the project and provide proven procedures that lead to a desired result. The phases included in the CSM project management approach include initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing out the project by transferring the completed product to the stakeholders and end users. The definition, creation, and setup of workflow process to initiate project requests from various stakeholders (such as the CBO Business Engineering Services Team), track status, monitor projects and tasks to further increase the likelihood of project success and provide senior managers with the visibility into the status of a project. 
The business owners (in addition to the HEC IT staff) need to have the authority and capability to create, modify, or deactivate workflows and any reports associated with them. To ensure the appropriate staff is able to perform these functions, the contractor shall deliver workflow training to the HEC IT, CSM, and business owners responsible for maintaining the workflow rules and system. 
The Contractor shall provide services on the following areas:

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
FAR 13.106(B)
This is a notice of intent of The Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10701 East Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio  44106 to negotiate sole source with Joerns, LLC for supplying The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, Nursing Service, with:
5 Used Bariatric Bed Frames.
2 Dolphin Autho Vector Control Units.

The Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC Nursing Service is requesting this equipment in
order to meet the specialized needs of its Spinal Cord Injury inpatient and long-term care patient populations. This patient population is acutely susceptible to pressure ulcers and requires specialized beds/mattresses to provide optimum care as well as minimize this risk during their stay. 

Currently, the medical center is renting the bariatric bed frames. The consistent needs of the patients on the acute and long-term care Spinal Cord Injury floors require the rental of at least five bariatric frames on any given day. The purchase of the bed frames as well as the control units that are currently being utilized will decrease the rental costs for the
medical center. 

The Government believes that only one business can satisfy the agency requirements and intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) - access to proprietary information. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by Monday January 28, 2013 at 5PM EST. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time.    All inquiries must be submitted by email to Rachelle Hamer at rachelle.hamer@va.gov.

<SOLNBR>ACQ-Option
<CONTACT>Josh Brimberry, Phone 5093767334, Email joshua_m_brimberry@rl.gov
<DESC><strong>CHPRC Acquisition Strategy Plan for Option Years</strong>
<p>In a continuing effort to identify project cost efficiencies and bring greater value to the U.S. government, CH2M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) is rolling out its subcontracting strategy for the next five-year option period contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
<p>Our subcontracting strategy in the first five years of our contract has worked well; however, the economy has changed. In the first five years of our contract, funding for cleanup increased dramatically due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and our teaming subcontractors were afforded opportunities of ten years' worth of work to complete in five years. The subcontracting strategy allowed us to put people to work quickly and expand our operations.</p>
<p>The nation is now in a budget environment where finding efficiencies is critical to maximize the amount of funding available for cleanup.</p>
<p>We anticipate our subcontracting strategy will generate savings between $7 and $9 million per year, allowing us to maximize cleanup dollars while still meeting or exceeding our subcontracting goals at Hanford (at least 17% of the total contract price will be performed by small businesses).</p>
<p>Three Competitive Requests For Proposals (RFPs) are planned for the permanent option period configuration. The roll out of RFPs and announcement of new subcontracts will be issued between late January 2013 and ~May 2013. Transition to new subcontractors is expected to be complete by end of December 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The planned competitive solicitations are:</strong></p>
<p>Decommissioning, Waste and Fuels and Remediation Services (DWFRS) <br />Brief Scope: Performing Decommissioning, Waste, Fuels and Remediation Services to include facility minimum safe and base operations, maintenance and work control for central plateau surveillance and maintenance organization; minimum safe and base operations, maintenance and work control for T-Plant, Central Waste Complex, Low Level Burial Ground, and Waste Receiving and Processing Facility; waste and transportation services; receiving Navy reactor compartments at Hanford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of Request of Expression of Interest: ~ Week of January 28th. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: ~ Week of February 15th</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Construction Support Services <br />Brief Scope: Subcontractor shall be responsible for providing building trades skilled craft, and craft supervision (general foreman or superintendents) necessary to accomplish preventative building maintenance on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. In addition, subcontractor shall be required to provide general field construction support for minor construction activities at various locations on the Hanford site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: ~Week of February 15th</p>
<p>Training and Procedures Support Services<br />Brief Scope: Training support to include analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of training and qualification/certification programs IAW DOE O 426.2, Personnel Selection, Training, Qualification, and Certification Requirements for DOE Nuclear Facilities. This work scope requires development and maintenance of processes that establish Company training programs, maintain individual training plans, scheduling of employee training, development and implementation of multiple forms of training, and interface and coordination with the site-wide training organization (HAMMER).</p>
<p>Procedure support will include analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of administrative and technical procedures programs IAW DOE O 422.1, Conduct of Operations. Work scope requires development and maintenance of processes and procedures that establish the Company procedures program, management of change control processes, maintenance of configuration controlled procedures web pages, and continuous interface and coordination with projects/facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Release of RFP: A decision will be made in May 2013 as to final scope and RFP release date.</p>
<br />
<p>In addition to the 3 competitive solicitations, CHPRC is looking for a small business that has the right size standard and economic status such as a certified 8a, Small Disadvantaged Service Veteran Owned or Hubzone business to become part of the DOE Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. Possible areas for work scope currently being considered are: Temporary administrative and records management support and summer intern program support. Release of Scope and solicitation for this procurement is still under development.</p>
<p>The CHPRC Current Solicitations page (http://chprc.hanford.gov/page.cfm/CurrentSolicitations) displays CHPRC's current, published Requests for Proposal.</p>
<p>Please visit the Doing Business with CHPRC page (http://chprc.hanford.gov/page.cfm/DoingBusinesswithCHPRC) for information regarding the requirements and expectations for working with CHPRC on the Hanford site.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Canberra Industries of Oak Ridge, TN for a Low Energy High Purity (HPGe) Germanium Spectrometer for the Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division of the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division develops, maintains and disseminates the measurement standards for ionizing radiations and radioactivity in the United States. The division pursues research in the fundamental physical interactions of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation with matter, including developing and using the key physical measurements needed in the study of biological systems and their function. The theoretical and experimental efforts support radiation and nuclear applications in health care and worker protection, advance spectroscopic methods to enable biotechnology and medical applications, enhance environmental protection, and support national security and defense.</p>
<p>The Low Energy High Purity (HPGe) Germanium Spectrometer is required for use in the Dosimetry Group, of the Radiation and Biomolecular Physics Division, in support of the program standards development for healthcare, namely air-kerma standards for mammographic x-rays. As new beam qualities are being developed by NIST to match those used in the clinics for digital mammography, measurement of the energy spectrum of photons from the x-ray tube is necessary to accurately determine correction factors for primary standard free-air chamber.</p>
<p>The new HPGe Spectrometer will be added to the existing mammography calibration range, measuring the x-ray spectra and enabling direction realization of air-kerma (related to patient dose). Due to incompatibility of the use of liquid nitrogen in the mammography calibration lab, the spectrometer must be cooled by a mechanical type cooler.</p>
<p>Canberra Industries, Inc is the sole HPGe Spectrometer manufacturer capable of providing the system that meets NIST requirements. Specifically, NIST requires: 1. Energy resolution must be at least 200 eV (FWHM) at 5.9 keV; 2. Energy range from at least 3 keV to 300 keV; 3. Entrance window thickness must be less than 0.04 mm beryllium; 4. Must have a mechanical type cooler (no liquid nitrogen is allowable).</p>
<p>Canberra Industries, Inc is the sole manufacturer and distributor of their instruments in the United States.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by February 6, 2013 will be considered by the Government.</p>

There is no other known contractor that has this unique knowledge and experience to do the work.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 12.3 and Contracting by Negotiation FAR PARTS 15.1 and 15.3 PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.<br />The Government intends to make its award decisions by selecting the proposal that represents the best value to the Government. FAR 2.101 defines "best value" as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In this acquisition, the Government will obtain best value by using the Tradeoff Process source selection approach defined at FAR 15.101-1; i.e., an approach which permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.
<p>Per FAR 52.212-1 offerors that fail to submit all the information necessary to evaluate their proposal with their initial proposal may be determined to be nonresponsive and no longer considered for award.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular. Applicable FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and may be viewed on the following website (s) <br />https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html<br />http://www.dm.usda.gov/procurement/policy/agar_x/agarbase/index.html<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325320 - Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing. This requirement is a total small business set aside. The small business size determination for this NAICS Code is 500 Employees.<br />ITEM DESCRIPTIONS AND QUANTITIES</p>
<p><br />The United States, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Plant Protection and Quarrantine Facility in Edinburg TX is in need of a Firm Fixed Priced Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery Contract for Hexanol Lures and Manuka Oil Lures for a base period and 4 option periods. <br /><br />Hexanol Lure - Estimated Maximum Annual Quantity - 75,000</p>
<p>Manuka Oil Lure - Estimated Maximum Annual Quantity - 50,000</p>
<p>The requested supplies are needed to equip program personnel to detect and monitor EAB pest infestations. The lure-baited traps are a primary detection tool used to delimit, and survey the extent of the pest infestation. Without these lure dispensers and traps defining the infestation might not be possible. The ultimate cost to the States which become infested could lose billions of dollars in forest products, and quarantines imposed by state and federal agencies may have dire consequences for plant and wood products industries. Severe damage would also occur within the tourist industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />BID SAMPLES REQUIRED FOR EVALUATION<br />Interested Vendors will be required to submit 50 samples of both Hexanol and Manuka Oil Lures for a total of 100 sample lures free of charge to the government by 03/04/2013/ No further consideration for award will be given to any vendor who fails to submit the required samples by this date to the following location:</p>
<p>Attention David Asher <br />USDA APHIS PPQ <br />22675 N Moorefield Road<br />Bldg 6407, Moore Air Base <br />Edinburg, TX 78541-5033 <br />Ref# AG-6395-S-13-0002<br /><br />** This address is for Samples Only. Do not forward solicitation/pricing proposal to Edinburg, TX Address.**</p>
<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURES<br />In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items; The USDA intends to award this using the FAR 15.101-1 Tradeoff process. A tradeoff process is appropriate when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.</p>
<p>Quality of Product Offered, Price and Past performance are equally important. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will be evaluated as neutral.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 18 JAN 13. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>

Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre-approved and described in the purchase order or Contract. 

"	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>I) Technical Capabilities<br />a) Experience<br />b) Understanding of the Requirement<br />II) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract resulting from this solicitation. The contract will be awarded to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, it is critical that each proposal be fully responsive. However, the Contracting Officer also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Capabilities. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. The Government must receive enough information to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE - The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the attached Pricing Templates for the Base Period and two (2) Option Periods and must be provided separately from your technical capabilities. Please note that columns C, D and F are password protected. Cell E must be completed using currency format ($0.00) in order for the extended price column (F) to calculate the correct total.</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES - The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work.<br />Sub Factor a. EXPERIENCE - The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub Factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the SOW, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings: Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follow. No Adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II - Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities - will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - A proposal that contains major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicate a lack of understanding of the SOW that may result in not being capable of meeting all the requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors - The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capabilities and its sub factors are significantly more important than Factor II, Price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II, Price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Proposals are due by Wednesday, February 6, 2013 at 9:00 a.m. EST. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Submit proposals to the attention of Jo Scott via email to: scott.jo@dol.gov.

3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3) PART III - PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION- Only references for same or similar type contracts as desired. Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in table A-2.</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past<br />performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(a) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of two (2) of the most relevant contracts preformed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. Relevant contracts include present/past performance effort which involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced: (i) Company/Division name, (ii) Product/Service, (iii) Contracting Agency/Customer, (iv) Contract Number, (v) Contract Dollar Value, (vi) Period of Performance, (vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, FAX, e-mail and telephone number of the contracting officer, (viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions, (ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. (b) If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts. (c) Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. (d) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following: (1) Requirements of the solicitation (Item Numbers) and Performance Work Statement (PWS) and government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS (2) Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items. Addendum to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price, Technical, and Past Performance.</p>
<p>After receipt of proposals, the proposals will be ranked by price before the Government assesses technical capability. Offers will be evaluated based on total price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise option(s). If the lowest priced offer is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be acceptable for Technical or Past Performance, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>1-23-2013<br /><strong>Question from Vendor: </strong>Would you be able to give me an estimate regarding how many embroidered long sleeve shirts (all colors combined) that you purchase on a monthly basis? The reason I ask is that because when embroidery is involved it becomes very difficult to estimate my costs if I don't know quantity.<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong> They (the shirts) are actually just a screen print, and we didn't clearly specify  whether I wanted a screen print or embroidery. Our quantities will vary due to class size fluctuation, but our minimum order will be for $200. We have just implemented these uniforms for our trade classes, so its new to us. We have 12 trade classes with about 12-25 students in each class. Nine of the classes are self-paced, 3 of the classes graduate together at once. That's the best I can do for you for an estimate

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled LITHIUM-ION BATTERY CELLS, NNC13459074Q  which was posted on DEC 17, 2012. CHANGED TO FULL AND OPEN - TO ALL SIZE VENDORS. You are notified that the following changes are made:  NEW SPECIFICATION STATEMENT; For Battery Cells for Constellation Missions; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center (NASA GRC) has a requirement for rechargeable Lithium-based (Li-based) battery cells for use in a battery module for the Advanced Exploration Systems Modular Power Systems project. The objective of this effort is to develop a nominal 120 Volt (V) modular battery. NASA GRC will design, build, and demonstrate one or more 120 V modules that will each consist of a series arrangement cells. A proof-of-concept ground demonstration will be performed to test the electrical operation of multiple modules in a paralleled configuration. The complete battery system will be configured with appropriate power electronics, sensors, and circuitry to properly monitor, control, and safeguard the operation of the cells, modules, and parallel-connected banks of modules. Ground testing on the demonstration units that will be built from the cells will be performed internally at NASA and will be for demonstration purposes only. The modular battery will be applicable across multiple Exploration missions to low- Earth-orbit, low-Lunar-orbit, near-Earth-objects, Lagrange points, planetary surfaces and the Moon. Vehicles and platforms that may utilize this modular concept include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Deep Space Habitat, 2. Waypoint/Gateway, 3. Multi-Mission, 4. Space Exploration Vehicle, 5. Solar Electric Propulsion Stage of the Space Launch System, 6. Cryogenic Propulsion Stage of the Space Launch System, 7. Rovers AND  8.	Landers 	 Cell designs that maximize specific energy and energy density while addressing the following additional features are desirable: 1. Capable of a continuous discharge rate of at least C/2 and discharge pulses of at least 1C, 2. Capable of recharge rates of at least C/2, 3. Minimum operating temperature range of -20 to +40 degrees Celsius, 4. Cycle life of up to 500 cycles at 100% depth-of-discharge and low-Earth-orbit cycle life up to 3500 cycles at 50% depth-of-discharge. (A low-Earthorbit power profile consists of a nominal 35 minute discharge and a nominal 55 minute charge performed continuously for 16 cycles per day). Since the cells will be used in a battery for a ground demonstration, cells will have ample time to rest and equilibrate after undergoing relatively few cycles while different mission scenarios are being simulated, 5. Long calendar life (up to five years), 6. Low self-discharge rate, 7. Low irreversible capacity loss (less than 7%) after 3 years of storage at room temperature or lower. Cylindrical cell geometries with capacities ranging from 40 to 60 ampere-hours (Ah) are highly desirable, however, all cell designs that meet the electrical performance requirements will be considered for selection, regardless of geometry. There is no cell-level specific energy or energy density requirement, however, we are seeking cells that are optimized for energy, not power. The goal for the mass of the assembled 120V modular battery demonstration unit, including electronics, is less than 98 kg. A cell volume of equal to or less than 0.6 liters is targeted. Aerospace design cells or flight cells are not required for this demonstration, however, robust packaging is desired. As such, pouch cells (cells in aluminized plastic packages) are not preferred. Vendors may propose more than one cell design. Vendors shall identify the specific requirements or features listed above that the proposed cell addresses. Vendors shall provide a separate quote and delivery date for each cell design offered in quantities of 40 cells and 125 cells. It is desired that all cells originate from the same manufacturing lot. In the response to this solicitation, the Vendor shall clearly state the Vendors own definition of what constitutes a - manufacturing lot -. If cells in the quantities requested cannot be produced from the same lot, the Vendor shall state the quantity of cells that are available from the same lot. Cell delivery is desired one to two months After Receipt of Order (ARO). Early delivery is a best value criterion. If a quantity of 40 cells from one lot can be delivered earlier than 125 cells, specify the delivery date for the 40 cells and the delivery date for the remaining cells. The Vendor shall comply with the relevant ISO standards or equivalent for manufacturing quality (ISO 9001, 14001). In addition to addressing the above stated requirements in their response, at a minimum, the Vendor shall specify, state or include the following in their response to the solicitation (some or all of this information may be provided in the form of a cell specification sheet): 1.	Model designation of cell 2.	Nameplate capacity of cell 3.	Cell component chemistry (anode, cathode, electrolyte, separator) 4.	Operating temperature range (recommended and excursion limits) 5.	Mass of cell (without fasteners or restraints) 6.	Volume of cell 7.	Outer dimensions of the cell (with and without terminals) 8.	Operating voltage range 9.	Average voltage of cell at C/5 and C/2 at 20 to 25 degrees Celsius (specify exact temperature) 10.	Ampere-hour capacity delivered by cell at C/5 and C/2 to 100% depth-of-discharge at 20 to 25 degrees Celsius (specify voltages and exact temperature) 11.	Provide plots of typical discharge curves (voltage versus capacity) with the response and state exact conditions (voltage, rate (current), temperature) data was collected under) 12.	Recommended discharge conditions and temperatures for cells 13.	Recommended charge conditions and temperatures for cells 14.	Continuous and pulse discharge limits for cells (voltages, rates (currents), and temperatures) 15.	Charge limits for cells (voltages, rates (currents), and temperatures) 16.	Internal cell resistance (specify how it was measured) 17.	Self-discharge rate after 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days and longer periods (state voltage, temperature, and other relevant conditions that the self-discharge rate was measured under) 18.	Recommended storage conditions and temperatures for cells 19.	Shelf life stated in terms of amount of irreversible capacity loss expected over a specified period of time (state voltage, temperature, and any other relevant conditions that the shelf life was measured under) 20.	Calendar life (state relevant conditions that the calendar life was measured under) 21.	Cycle life (specify depth-of-discharge, voltage ranges, temperature and any other relevant conditions that the cycle life was measured under) 22.	Cell case construction (materials and how case is sealed) 23.	Cell case polarity 24.	Safety Features - Vendor shall identify safety features that are incorporated into the cell design. Vendor shall specify how the cell design responds to the following potential hazards: a.  Electrolyte leakage b.  Overcharge or overdischarge c.  Pressure build-up d.  Short circuits (internal and external) e.  Overcurrent The Vendor may include supporting data to demonstrate the cells response to the potential hazards. The Vendor shall also state if there are any features incorporated into the cell that might interfere with or prevent thirty-three or more cells to be connected in a series configuration and share the same flow of current under normal operating conditions. 25.	Cell design tolerances, including capacity (specify conditions capacity is measured under) and dimensions. The Vendor shall state how compliance with tolerances is achieved/assured. 26.	The actual or expected manufacturing date of the cells (the date cells are filled or sealed). Expected manufacturing date can be stated in terms of After Receipt of Order (ARO) if so desired. 27.	Delivery date for cells (if it varies by the quantity of cells, specify all dates) . The due date for responses is extended to January 28th at close of business 4:30 pm. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22 Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p><br />Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>

<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are equal to price.</p>
<p>Technical Approach: Evaluation of technical approach shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed technical approach is capable of meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed technical approach is capable of meeting these requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not address a certain minimum requirement in its proposed technical approach, NIST will determine that it does not meet.<br />As noted in specification 7.4, stronger consideration will be given for a leak rate that does not exceed 1-x10-9 std. cc/sec for either test.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience in fabricating deuterium storage tanks and helium leak testing, and will consider the relevance of the offeror's experience to the current requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Approach Evaluation factor.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

<DESC><p><br />Solicitation No. BBG50-13-01152013-WG<br />Mobile Phone Survey<br />Questions/Answers</p>
<p><br />Q1. The opportunity is called various things throughout the document: pre-solicitation, combined synopsis/solicitation, RFP, and RFQ. Can you please confirm the type of opportunity?<br />A1. RFP</p>
<p>Q2. What type of contract does the BBG intend to execute: FFP or T&amp;M?<br />A2. FFP</p>
<p>Q3. Price quotations are requested not to exceed Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT). The SAT is applied to Small Businesses, but the solicitation does not indicate that it is Small Business Set Aside. Is the solicitation full and open?<br />A3. Small Business Set</p>
<p>Q4. The Offeror must submit both a Price Quotation and Technical Information. Are there any page limits or other requirements for these two volumes? <br />A4. No page limitation</p>
<p>Q5. The proposal is due on February 7 at 2:00pm, but the opportunity indicates that fieldwork should be conducted between February 11, 2013 and March 30, 2013. Does the BBG still intend to stick with this fieldwork schedule? <br />A5. Survey work will probably begin on or around March 15</p>
<p>Q6. Questions are due on January 22, but the solicitation indicates that it is a Monday. Monday is a Federal holiday. Should questions be due on Tuesday, January 22?<br />A6. Tuesday, January 22</p>
<p>Q7. Are the demographic information questions that are required (i.e. gender, age, and education) included as part of the 10 survey questions?<br />A7. NO</p>
<p>Q.8 Currently the proposal notes a location variable. Can you please confirm what is meant by "location". For example is the requirement for urban/rural, or the city/village the respondent is located in at the time of the survey?<br />A8. In most cases province and whether the location is urban or rural will be sufficient. However, in the event that potential vendors have means of identifying respondents' locations more precisely via technological means, that would be welcome.</p>
<p>Q9. As the survey fieldwork is to commence by Feb. 11th please advise what is the intended date that BBG will notify applicants of an award date? <br />A9. Survey work will probably begin on or around march 15</p>
<p>Q10. Could you please confirm this is the same opportunity that BBG released an RFI for last January 2012: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=df2e62eafd6073945443f02ee4ac6687&amp;_cview=0<br />A10. This is a new Requirement</p>
<p>Q11. Is there an incumbent for these services or is this a new requirement? If an incumbent exists, could you please provide the incumbent's name and contract number?<br />A11. This is a new Requirement</p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 02/08/13. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved source is: BioFire Diagnostics (088J2). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

<DESC>Request For Information  <br>    <br>  Program Title:  Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS)  <br>    <br>  Introduction:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to procure equipment for the Life Cycle Replacement of the current Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS) located at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California.    <br>    <br>    <br>  Acquisition Strategy Planning Information (Draft):  <br>    <br>  Contract Vehicle:  TBD   <br>  Contract Type:  FFP - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable  <br>    <br>  Acquisition Time Estimates:   <br>   	Sources Sought Release Feb 2013  <br>   	RFP Release March 2013  <br>   	Contract Award June 2013  <br>    <br>    <br>  Requirement:  Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to procure equipment for the Life Cycle Replacement of the current Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS) located at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California.  These efforts include the procurement and installation of the hardware and software components to provide continuous monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum and direction finding of basic electromagnetic radiation parameters in the frequency range of 20MHz to 3GHz.  The SMECS will consist of two fixed locations and one mobile system for detection and direction finding.  The two fixed systems will be located remotely on Tiefort and Granite Mountains and will be controlled from the SMECS monitoring station to be located in the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  The mobile portion of the SMECS hardware will be installed in the NTC G6 HMMWV (V-30B) communications shelter.  In addition, it is anticipated that delivery of initial spares, New Equipment Training (NET), and integration/testing support will be necessary.  <br>    <br>  Background Information:  <br>    <br>  Spectrum Monitoring and Engineering Control System (SMECS):  <br>  SMECS is a subsystem of the National Training Center - Instrumentation System (NTC-IS).  The SMECS is a stand-alone system.  SMECS provides the means to monitor, measure, and record all relevant NTC electromagnetic emissions that may interfere with the NTC or regional area surrounding Fort Irwin, CA.  It has the capability to track signal sources via fixed site and mobile direction finding.  The SMECS is comprised of two components, a Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) component and a Direction Finding (DF) component.    <br>    <br>  Real Time Monitoring Frequency (RTMF) Component:  <br>  The RTMF component equipment is located at two fixed sites, Tiefort and Granite Mountains and controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  Data and control functions for the RTMF are provided via the Range Monitoring and Control Subsystem (RMCS) fiber-optic component.  The RTMF provides a real-time monitoring function to assess the battlefield spectrum during exercises and supports regional frequency management monitoring and control functions. The RTMF component of SMECS continuously monitors the electromagnetic spectrum over a frequency range from 20 MHz to 40 GHz.    <br>    <br>  Direction Finding (DF) Component:  <br>  The DF component provides the capability to continuously monitor electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 20 MHz to 1 GHz, and upon operator selection, accurately display the line of bearing to the source of any signal of interest.  The DF component consists of three discrete components: a free ranging mobile DF, mounted on the NTC G6 HMMWV, and two functionally identical fixed sites located on Tiefort and Granite Mountains, which are remotely controlled from the Spectrum Management Facility, Building 6252.  These sites send and receive data and commands via the RMCS fiber-optic component.  <br>    <br>  Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The Government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in Feb 2013.  The Government does not plan to conduct an Industry day for this effort.    <br>    <br>  RFI:  As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a no more than 5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/Government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.  Responses must include evidence of being capable of meeting a 12 month after contract award delivery schedule with no development funding provided and please state the feasibility of fielding in 6 months.  The Government would also like to know whether the Prime contractor is an awarded STOC II contractor and their designated under Lot I or Lot II.  Should you be a Small Business that is expecting to be prime contractors for this effort please state how you will meet the limitations on subcontracting as set forth in FAR 52.219-14.    <br>    <br>  POC:  Technical questions should be directed to Frank Lumley, Project Director, Frank.Lumley1@us.army.mil.  Interested parties should provide their RFI response via email to Christopher Camp, Contract Specialist, Christopher.J.Camp@us.army.mil.  Provide your response NLT 2:00pm, February 1, 2013.  <br>    <br>  Disclaimer:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY <br>  <br> This is a sources sought announcement/market survey for written documentation only.  Responses to this sources sought/RFI notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement.  This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation.  All interested sources must respond to any future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> The National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) is the Defense Department's primary producer of ground forces intelligence.  NGIC produces scientific and technical intelligence and military capabilities analysis on foreign ground forces required by warfighting commanders, the force modernization and research and development communities, Defense Department, and national policymakers.  <br>  <br> NGIC is conducting market research for a potential requirement.  NGIC is performing market research for intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm Program.  The Quiet Storm Program is an interagency Counter-Improved Explosive Device (C-IED) targeting and analysis effort.  The program responds to immediate intelligence support tasks from task forces in the Iraq and Afghanistan warfighting theaters aimed at stopping daily loss of life of US soldiers to IEDs on the battlefield. <br>  <br> The purpose of this notice enables NGIC to obtain and acquire market information, determine the availability and capability of sources, obtain information on how prospective firms would provide intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm program, and determine approximate costs and implementation timelines. <br>  <br> The primary focus for this project is to provide intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm Program.  Support includes intelligence analysis that investigates, analyzes, and targets the global movement of dual-use components and technology by illicit procurement networks worldwide.  The Quiet Storm Program identifies intelligence gaps in analytic knowledge and provides measures to rectify inadequacies.  Analysts identify emerging threats and historical trends, fusing multiple sources/forms of intelligence data together for network technical and targeting analysis.  Analysts present briefings on a wide variety of intelligence products to general officers and senior government officials and work closely with a multitude of CONUS and OCONUS-based intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies operating within various regions of the world.  These services will be performed onsite at the NGIC in Charlottesville, VA. <br>  <br> Duties include: Program Manager, Financial Analyst, Network Analyst, TECHINT Subject Matter Expert (SME), Senior Principle Analyst, SIGINT Analyst, and Open Source Analyst. <br>  <br> Performance requires a TOP SECRET contractor facility clearance.  Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be U.S. Citizens, have a final TOP SECRET clearance with a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), and shall be eligible for indoctrination to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level.  Some positions may require a Polygraph examination if additional accesses are required.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary security clearances for contractor personnel.  This TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance requirement may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. <br>  <br> A cost-reimbursable type contract is anticipated with up to four (4) option-year periods, (i.e., base year plus four (4) option years). <br>  <br> Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ( quote mark Limitations on Subcontracting quote mark ).  13 C.F.R. 125.6 contains the prime contractor performance requirements under these limitations on subcontracting rule.  Failure to definitively address each of these factors may result in a finding that the respondent lacks the capability to perform the work. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Prospective sources possessing the capability, experience, and security clearance qualifications are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought for the NGIC Quiet Storm Program.  Please do not provide standard marketing brochures, catalogs, etc. <br>  <br> Responses to this notice shall be limited to no more than fifteen [15] pages, 8.5 quote mark  x 11 quote mark  paper, 12 pitch, Arial font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around, and must include: <br>  <br> 1.	Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives. <br>  <br> 2.	Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses. <br>  <br> 3.	Capability statement(s) demonstrating a prospective firm's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform the tasks to provide intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm program. <br>  <br> 4.	Pricing Information: NGIC has determined to seek pricing information rather than a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM).  NGIC is looking for competitive market pricing with a place of performance at Rivanna Station, Charlottesville, VA.  The labor categories identified in the sources sought/RFI encompass the services necessary to meet the requirements.  NGIC is trying to determine the availability of firms in the commercial marketplace to fulfill the anticipated performance-based requirements.  NGIC is looking for firms to demonstrate what labor categories they would use and bill (fully burdened commercial hourly rates) to perform the services.  Please provide the information requested in the attached spreadsheet.  NGIC appreciates your support in providing information for this notice and market research effort. <br>  <br> 5.	Responders should identify any relevant contracts under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541690.  Please identify whether your firm is a Large Business, Small Business, Very Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) Program Small Business, Women-owned Small Business, HUB Zone Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business, Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business, and/or a Native American Small Business under the proposed NAICS code.  The small business size standard associated with NAICS 541690 is $14.0M.  Also, please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate your firm's status. <br>  <br> 6.	DUNS number, CAGE Code, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) to be considered as potential sources. <br>  <br> 7.

If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency and point of contact that approved the system. <br>  <br> 9.	Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work. <br>  <br> To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  All government and contractor personal reviewing RFI responses will have signed non-disclosure agreements and understand their responsibility for proper use and protection from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information as described 41 USC 423.  The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. <br>  <br> All interested sources shall send all feedback and responses in writing electronically to Jessica C. Mullins, Contracting Officer at jessica.c.mullins.civ@mail.mil and Brian K. Ellison, Contract Specialist at brian.k.ellison2.civ@mail.mil  with  quote mark W911W5-QUIETSTORM quote mark  in the email subject line.  Responses must be received no later than 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (1630 hours) on Thursday, 24 January 2013.  Responses received after this date and time may not be reviewed. <br>  <br> An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from interested firms during this phase of the acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government official.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman is Mr. Jeffrey D. Willey, HQ ACQ Center, at (703)-428-4595.  The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level. <br>  <br> Responses to this announcement will not be returned, and there will not be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses.  However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and the Contracting Officer or NGIC Quiet Storm manager may contact one or more respondents for clarifications to enhance the Government's understanding.  This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any solicitation.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS HSCG38-13-S-010013<br />CATEGORY:<br />USCG HC-144A Aircraft components inspected, repaired, modified or overhauled<br />CONTACT:<br />Commanding Officer, USCG Aviation Logistics Center, <br />1664 Weeksville Road Bldg 63 <br />Elizabeth City NC 27909-5001<br />Linda Clark <br />Contract Specialist<br />Linda.D.Clark@uscg.mil<br />Phone: 252-334-5212<br />Fax: 252-334-5427<br />SYNOPSIS:<br />This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG/CG) currently operates Fourteen HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The projected number of Coast Guard assets over the next five years includes up to twenty operational HC-144A aircraft with each averaging 1200 flight hours annually. The components listed are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand based out of Windsor locks CT, USA.</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To obtain a five year firm fixed price contract for services from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized overhaul and repair center or equivalent to effectively inspect, test, troubleshoot, clean, overhaul, repair, and modify, the listed HC-144A components to current OEM configurations while maintaining any CG specific requirements for return to service in a Ready For Issue (RFI) condition and CG operational use. The components must remain configured for installation on USCG HC-144A aircraft. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed<br />To have all Components listed inspected, repaired, modified or overhauled IAW OEM repair specifications, and Component Maintenance Manuals, including Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, and Amendments. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service with FAA airworthiness Form 8130-3 or other FAA authorized airworthiness form attached. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service within 60 calendar days after receipt of material (ARM) at contractors repair facility. <br />All interested vendors must be able to obtain and maintain a current list and status of all OEM Overhaul, Repair and Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), including Revisions (Rev), Temporary Revisions (TR), Service Bulletins (SB), Modifications (MOD), Amendments (AMD) or other specifications applicable to the overhaul, repairs and modification of the listed assemblies and its components <br />To track and document calendar time, flight time, flight/life cycles, all work and services performed on these components as required under USCG ACMS. Tracking provides significant component historical records of component installations, removals, overhauls, repairs, and modifications including component transit, storage, status, and locations. ACMS tracking provides and an effective means of configuration control to maintain the integrity of OEM overhaul/high time hourly intervals including flight and life cycle limits as applicable. For configuration control prior written approval of the CG Contracting Officer shall be obtained for any configuration changes to propeller assemblies, blades, and components. <br />REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via email to: Linda Clark, HC-144A Contract Specialist at Linda.D.Clark@uscg.mil<br />Nomenclature and parts numbers that will be on the schedule are as follows:</p>

<CONTACT>Mark C. Green, Email mark.c.green@usmc.mil
<DESC>The Product Manager, Combat Support Systems, Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), is seeking information from commercial sources to satisfy its requirement for a Crew Protection Kit (CPK) for the Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF). The CPK shall be configured as a removable "plug and play" cab which provides a minimum of STANAG Level I protection. <br />The Marine Corps is currently procuring LCRTF's from Kalmar RT LLC. The approved acquisition objective for the LCRTF is 799. Approximately 100 CPK's are planned for procurement. After conducting market research, it is anticipated that the Marine Corps will release a Request for Proposals (RFP) leading to the award of a fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the CPK. <br />Balancing the various CPK characteristics will be essential to the development of a successful armor solution. The following are some of the characteristics that shall be considered and incorporated; level of protection, operator visibility and overall human systems integration, weight, and commonality of interior cab components to that of the commercial cab. The culminating challenge is development of a CPK that will meet each of the requirements while avoiding or at least minimizing the performance degradation of the forklift. To evaluate the affect the CPK will have on the forklift, the Government will be requiring a System Impact Assessment as part of the RFP.<br />To allow interested sources to view and assess the LCRTF, the Marine Corps intends to schedule site visits to be conducted at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia during the week of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">05 to&nbsp;07&nbsp;February 2013</span>. The intent is to allow companies to obtain the necessary information to fully understand the needs of the Marine Corps to increase their ability to respond to the upcoming RFP. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">***This procurement is set-aside for qualifing Small Business concerns."<br /><br />Small Businesses desiring to attend the site visit must respond no later than 4:00pm EST 25 January. <br /><br /><br /></span>RFI responses must be submitted to MCSC no later than 4:00 PM EST 18 December 2012. Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed twelve (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Responses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New. Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "LCRTF Crew Protection Kit RFI Response". <br />Such responses should at a minimum provide the following information:<br />1. Written confirmation of intent to participate in the future LCRTF CPK procurement; include size and status information regarding your business; <br />2. Estimated pricing to provide the LCRTF CPK; sufficient detail should be provided to explain the basis for such estimate; <br />3. Information explaining your capability to manufacture and delivery the LCRTF CPK; this should include an estimate of your notional delivery schedule; listing of key teaming partners and subcontractors and their various roles; and<br />4. Explanation as to your specific design for the LCRTF CPK.<br />Based on a review of RFI responses, the Government will contact potential sources to schedule site visits as addressed above. <br />This is only a Request for Information. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

<DESC><p align="left">Though the Government included FAR 52.217-8 in the initial request for proposal and subsequent task order award, pricing was not specifically requested or evaluated for the six (6) month extension of services prior to award of the current task order, thus necessitating this justification and approval. The six (6) month extension of services will be executed in accordance with FAR 52.217-8 - Option to Extend Services. As a result, the all terms and conditions of the existing task order will be in full force and effect in the six (6) month extension, inclusive of labor categories and firm fixed-price labor rates. The price for the extension of services will be based on the contractor's labor categories, labor rates, labor hours and labor skill mix were evaluated at the time of task order award and determined to be fair and reasonable based upon adequate price competition. The technical scope of work will be identical to the work that is currently performed under the existing task order.</p>
