In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>This non-commercial requirement is to convert the Royal Saudi Air Forces (RSAFs) F-15S aircraft to an F-15SA configuration and support OCONUS base stand up. Due to the government not possessing data rights to this new mission design series platform needed for competition, the effort will be sole sourced to the OEM, The Boeing Company (0PXV4), under 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as the one responsible source with no other supplies or services capable of satisfying agency requirements. This effort provides for engineering development of the Country Standard Time Compliance Technical Order (CSTCTO), CSTCTO integration and testing, Retrofit Installation Drawings (RIDs) development, fabrication of trial kits to support Validation and Verification activities, procurement of 70 Conversion kits, and the procurement and installation of 4 base stand-up kits. The base stand-up kits will be needed to support initial F-15SA production and converted aircraft arrival at four In-Kingdom locations. Based upon of the Bill of Materials being developed and delivered as part of this effort, the base stand-up kits will consist of new and unique and long lead F-15SA Classified and Unclassified initial spares, initial support equipment and support equipment spares. This is initial support only with upcoming Competitive Contracts being awarded to provide future aircraft sustainment. The 70 Conversion kits will contain all material required to convert an F-15S aircraft to an F-15SA configuration based on the before mentioned CSTCTO and RIDs. It should be noted this work is to fulfill a Foreign Military Sale. The period of performance for this requirement is planned to begin 06 March 2012 and extend through 31 Dec 2019. Any offeror who feels that they can meet these requirements, based on the before mentioned data, is encouraged to submit appropriate documentation to be reviewed by our government Program Manager. This requirement will not be delayed for qualification purposes.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by&nbsp;Palmetto GBA&nbsp;under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0002Z&nbsp;authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.<br />&nbsp;<br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>Laundry/Linen Cleaning Service
Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, management, supplies, bulk delivery carts, facilities including transportation of laundry/linen to contractor owned-contractor operated bulk laundry facility to accomplish the required laundry/linen cleaning service and tasks noted herein for the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare (TVHS) which consists of the Nashville Campus, located at 1310 24th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee 37212 and Murfreesboro Campus, located at 3400 Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro, Tennessee 37129 and all affiliated Outpatient clinics.           
The work required consists of furnishing the physical laundry plant (at an off-site location), all labor, supervision, management, management support, supplies, commonized linen and textile items, ancillary equipment, vehicles and materials necessary for accomplishment of complete laundry/linen services.
 Commonized linen services shall be provided by the Contractor. This includes scheduled visits to each facility to conduct linen utilization reviews, inventories, establishing and revising linen quotas, providing in-service and an on-line linen ordering system (electronically). This shall benefit both the facility and contractor in executing a linen management program, maintaining cost and customer satisfaction.
All workmanship shall be in accordance with practices/guidelines established by the National Association of Institutional Linen Management (NAILM), International Fabricare Institute (WI), Textile Rental Services Association (TRSA) and accepted industry standards. It is intended that services shall include all processes necessary for the laundering and finishing of the articles even though every step involved is not specifically mentioned. All work shall be performed under sanitary conditions as specified by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). Physical separation, through the presence of a barrier wall and the use of pass-through equipment is required to maintain positive air pressure in the clean section relative to a negative air pressure in the soiled section. In no case shall clean and soiled linen share the same physical space. The Laundry Plant layout/design should incorporate a "design for asepsis" whereby clean linen neither comes into contact with soiled linens nor shares the same physical space, thus avoiding cross-contamination and/or reintroduction of bacteria once processed. Plants in which the work is done shall be open to inspection of sanitary conditions by Government representatives. After processing, laundered articles shall be in serviceable and sanitary condition, meeting established quality and performance requirement standards.
Contractor Experience. The Contractor shall have experience in providing Medical Center laundry/linen services. The firm must have gained this experience as a result of being primarily engaged in the business of providing laundry/linen services in Medical Center environments (e.g. inpatient and outpatient medical treatment facilities) for a minimum of three consecutive years prior to submitting proposal.
Supervision by Contractor. The Contractor shall assign an on-site manager at their laundry processing plant who shall be physically present during prescribed work hours. The on-site manager is solely responsible to supervise the provision of these laundry/linen services and serves as the primary point of contact with the Government. The Contractor shall designate a qualified alternate to substitute for the on-site manager in his absence or during periods of work performed after normal work hours. The Contractor's Plant Manager (CPM) must meet the following requirements:
"	Certified by NAILM or graduate of an independently controlled management-training program emphasizing institutional laundry. The formal course must have been previously established. 
"	CPM shall have at least three years of specialized experience in this capacity. This specialized experience may be substituted for certification.

<p>Item; MAJ-179<br />Description: Sliding keyboard tray for WM-NP1, WM-WP1, and WM-DP1 EVIS Exera II procedure carts<br />Unit of Issue: Each<br />Quantity: 1</p>
<p>The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The Clinical Center (CC) provides patient care facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas, and other training programs.</p>
<p>The Department of Critical Care Medicine (CCMD) provides treatment and therapy to critically ill inpatients and performs research studies on critical care diseases.  In addition, the Clinical Center maintains a pulmonary consult service which utilizes this equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of request is to provide sole source justification for the purchase and replacement of outdated Olympus bronchoscopy cart components.  These components are the latest state-of-the-art technology available that enhances our ability identify pulmonary abnormalities.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health, Critical Care Medicine Department, has a requirement to provide state-of-the-art supportive critical care to the critically ill patient using this life supporting gas therapy. The usage of this gas is entirely dependent on the critical condition of various patients meeting implementation criteria, therefore usage (duration) cannot be anticipated.</p>
<p>Facts and Other Reasons to Justify Other Than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>Olympus bronchoscopy equipment is only sold by Olympus America. Olympus America does not sell through distributors. Such equipment is proprietary to Olympus America.</p>
<p>The Olympus CV-180 Video Processor and CLV-180 Lightsource are the only processor and lightsource that will work with the video bronchoscopes we currently own.  Other manufacturers units will not work with our current scopes.</p>
<p>The Olympus CV-180 Video Processor is the only processor that will work with our bronchial ultrasound bronchoscope.  Other manufacturer's units will not work.</p>
<p>The Olympus CV-180 Video Processor accepts a digital camera card for photo documentation.  This is the only processor that does this and is necessary for documentation of abnormal findings.</p>
<p>The Olympus CV-180 has a "Picture in Picture" feature so we can see ultrasound or Xray on the same screen as the bronchoscopic image.  Other manufacturer's units can perform this.</p>
<p>The Olympus system has Narrow Band Imaging technology to help pull out detail in the image. This feature is exclusive to the Olympus system and is used by our pulmonologists to enhance diagnosis of diseases pulmonary tissue.</p>
<p>There is no other vendor with the necessary skills that can meet the complexity or specificity required to support the listed equipment within the needed timeframe of February 6, 2012.  No other vendor can support this highly technical bronchoscope other than factory-trained Olympus engineers.  Therefore, it is not feasible to obtain full and open competition at this time.</p>
<p>The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received no later than February 3, 2012, 12:00PM, Eastern Standard Time. The proposed award date will be on or before February 6, 2012. Please email Doug Reed, Contract Specialist, at douglas.reed@nih.gov for questions or to submit capability statements pertaining to this notice.  No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, California 94547, for 384-Well High-Capacity Alpha Unit with a trade-in.</p>
<p>1. Item ALS1238G, Description: 384-Well High-Capacity Alpha Unit with Hot Bonnet Heated Lid; 384 -well reaction module for DNA Engine thermal cyclers, holds one 384-well microplate, Quantity: Ten (10) Each. (Trade-in for 10 faulty alpha units)</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Molecular Genetics Section of the Genome Technology Branch, NHGRI has upgraded the genotyping capabilities in the Finnish US Investigation of NIDDM (FUSION) genetics study to increase throughput and versatility as well as lower the cost of high throughput SNP analysis. The FUSION project has been investigating the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Through years on investigation and research the appropriate analyses were developed to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to discover T2D associated genes. <br />To implement this analysis in high throughput fashion we purchased the Tetrad DNA Engine thermocyclers. These units have the ability to perform polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) on 1536 samples concurrently and occupy the smallest bench area of any instrument of this type thus maximizing the output and minimizing the space. The Alpha Unit is the critical piece of the instrument that heats and cools the samples in the PCR reaction. These units are modular and can be replaced without incurring the cost of replacing the entire instrument. There are no replacement parts for the Alpha units so they cannot be repaired. Bio-Rad laboratories is the sole source for this requirement.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, with size standard of 500. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55 (January 3, 2012).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by January 27, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-061-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive an award from the NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov, and ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.</p>

Expand Mental Health Beds
VA259-12-R-0124

The Salt Lake City Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) has a requirement for the renovation of the two upper floors of Building 3.

This expansion will force the relocation of the Substance Abuse Residency to the second floor, allowing for expansion of this unit. 

The contract will consist of mechanical/HVAC, flooring, security and fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems to remodel the upper two floors of Building 3.

The POC for this project will be Andrew Stigen.  He can be contacted at 307-433-3739 or email at Andrew.stigen@va.gov.

Failure to be both VERIRIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive.

<DESC>The US Forest Service, Bend/Fort Rock Ranger District, anticipates the release of a solicitation for the following work under an A &amp; E single source contract.&nbsp; This is ONLY a sources sought notice and is not intended to serve any other purpose.&nbsp; The issuance of a solicitation is expected to be made within the next 30 - 60 days.&nbsp; Once the solicitation is issued, please follow the instructions contained within the notice to offers.&nbsp; Again, this is not a request for offer nor is it a request for potential contractors to contact the USFS.<br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND
<p>The Bend/Fort Rock (BFR) Ranger District is part of the Deschutes National Forest which is located in Central Oregon to the South-West of Bend, OR.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to design and construct a Welcome Station on the Bend/Fort Rock (BFR) Ranger District, Deschutes National Forest (DNF). With the consolidation of the Deschutes Supervisors Office (SO) and the BFR office into a single building on the east side of Bend, there is no longer a location close to the Forest boundary allowing visitors to Bend an opportunity to interact with the Forest Service (FS) for Forest information. The Welcome Station will fill this gap and give visitors a chance to engage with the FS prior to recreating along the Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway.</p>
<p>The project will consist of either relocating an existing building or constructing a new 1,500 square foot station that operates as a resource center, interpretive site, and retail point. It is intended that this building will be an energy efficient facility. Developing interpretation and information kiosks, an outdoor seating area, an access road, parking lots, and associated site, utilities and landscape work is also part of this project.</p>
<p>The following General Scope of Work outlines the Tasks and additional criteria involved to accomplish these activities.</p>
<p>GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide architectural, engineering, and technical design services to the USDA Forest Service (FS) for the preparation of Concept Design Documents, Preliminary Design Documents, Construction Documents, and Engineering Services during Construction for the construction of the Cascade Lakes Welcome Station. Design shall meet the requirements of the most recent edition of the specific design criteria and codes listed in all sections of this contract (including Section J), the FS Manuals and Handbooks, and State/Local requirements if more stringent than those listed above.</p>
<p>The FS shall have unlimited rights in all drawings, designs, AutoCAD drafting disks, specifications, notes and other works developed in the performance of this contract, including the right to use same on any other FS design or construction without additional compensation to the Contractor.</p>

CCs will also participate in developing a plan to carry out biospecimen collection from critically ill patients that can be archived for future measurement of longitudinal molecular phenotypes. Research conducted by this network should utilize the most modern and flexible electronic data collection, transfer, decision support, and monitoring. Members of the Network will be encouraged to develop and participate in a collaborative Institutional Review Board (IRB) program to reduce the time and redundancy of protocol approvals and monitoring.</p>
<p>The CCC will coordinate all aspects of the research, including development of protocols, management and analysis of data, and assurance of data quality. The CCC will be responsible for collecting and archiving biospecimens during the contract and depositing the specimens in the NHLBI biorepository at the end of each study.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>The CC is expected to fulfill the following:</p>
<p>1) Experienced and highly competent in multi-center clinical trials in critically ill patients with or at risk for ALI.<br />2) One Co-PI will be a pulmonary/critical care clinician investigator. The other Co-PI, from the same institution, will represent another specialty such as an emergency department physician who can identify at risk patients. <br />3) Capable of proposing and working collaboratively with other CCs and the CCC to select and develop at least 2 clinical treatment protocols in the first year. Protocols are expected to emphasize prevention and early treatment, but treatments for established ALI and/or very high priority observational studies may be conducted if they have high potential to improve patient outcomes.<br />4) Participate in developing a scheme to collect biospecimens that can be archived for future longitudinal molecular phenotyping studies of critically ill patients from being at risk until recovery from ALI. <br />5) Assist with the development of an efficient Network IRB review process to enhance timeliness and value of IRB reviews e. g., collaborative or central IRB.<br />6) Participate in subcommittees including protocol development and writing committees, publications, sub-studies, ethics, enrollment and others, as necessary.<br />7) Enroll a minimum of 40 patients per year; oversee or obtain informed consent, and collect and transmit screening and enrollment data to the CCC. Collect and send high quality biospecimens as described in protocols. <br />8) Conduct regular site-coordination meetings that review screening enrollment practices, data quality and accuracy, oversight of patient care, and adherence to protocols. If coordinators do not have clinical background, activities to supplement medical knowledge must be carried out. <br />9) Serve as a protocol PI, as appropriate. <br />10) Coordinate with the CCC to train staff in Network protocols and procedures, including 1) care and treatment of critically ill patients as described in approved protocols; 2) bedside data collection and possibly use of decision support tools; 3) collection, processing, and shipping of specimens to the network central laboratory; 4) clinical testing, extraction of clinical data from medical records, data entry, and transmission of clinical data to the CCC; and 5) adverse and unexpected event reporting. <br />11) Participate in regular meetings and teleconferences of the PIs and research coordinators to monitor trial and Network progress, identify problems, and develop solutions. <br />12) Work collaboratively with other CCs and with the CCC to develop new protocols ensuring an available new protocol at all times. <br />13) Participate in site visits, as needed.</p>
<p>14) Participate in writing final reports and data sets.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7025-01-490-6701	<br />Name:		Mouse, Optical Sensor, Black<br />Description:	Hard-wired mouse connects to USB port. Mouse is black with optical sensor. UOI <br /> is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7025-01-490-6701	<br />Similar Items:	LOG910001439; KMW72358; IVR61027; 35H-00005; LOG910001601;&nbsp;AMU10USZ; AMU36USZ; 4YH-00002</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 8, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: ZONE is an innovative method for improving athletes responses to stress, anxiety, andloss of concentration during competition. In the training environment, when the usersuccessfully attains an optimal target state of psychophysiological functioning, thetechnology informs and/or rewards that user through real-time physical changes in theathletic equipment. For example, in the training setting, a golfer can work towardoptimal concentration in the act of putting, leading to improved performance in realsituations.The system uses perturbation feedback to help the athlete get into the zone through anoriginal method of ZONEthe method allows a trainee to learn physiological selfregulation in order to modify the difficulty of the performance task and/or environmentin which training is conducted. For example, better concentration leads to a variety ofeasier conditions on a training putting green.The technology incorporates software and hardware to provide real-time feedback to theathlete about how close his or her arousal and emotive responses are to an optimal staterequired to successfully perform the athletic task. This innovation presents thecapability to extend current sports training and psychological practices of guidedimagery visualization and cognitive reinforcement learning by systematically providingdemonstrable and relevant feedback through the use of closed-loop, cybernetic feedbackprinciples that provide immediate reinforcement of pyschophysiological self-regulationand translate into better skill-based performance.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

CHEMM's expert interface will link users to resources from other organizations, e.g., U.S. EPA/NOAA (CAMEO tools), the CDC's Emergency Preparedness and Response Web site and NIOSH Emergency Response Safety and Health Database (ERSH-DB), the chemical industry's CHEMTREC service, poison control centers, etc. Like NIH's WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) and REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management), CHEMM is available on the Internet for online use on computers and handheld devices, and also for download so that it can be used in an emergency even without an Internet connection.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />The contractor will implement specific tasks to accomplish the work outlined below during the period of performance.</p>
<p>Task 1. Create new content for CHEMM in easy Web-readable style, by extracting/summarizing data from NLM approved reference materials. The content should be written for easily readable style for the Web.</p>
<p>Task 2. Enhance, update, and revise current topical content for CHEMM.</p>
<p>Task 3. Select references and Web links to Internet resources for inclusion in CHEMM Website, and provide comments on possible enhancement of the selection criteria.</p>
<p>Task 4. Support content building activities such as facilitating peer consultation and peer review meetings, pending on availability of funding.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available. However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>

A positive and productive working relationship has been established with this contractor through repeated required meetings as stipulated in this contract.  There are a number of complicated statistical issues associated with this work that require specific relevant expertise and experience.  These issues include a variety of topics that fall under the subject known as spatial statistics, a sub-discipline of statistics.  In addition, the types of models that are envisioned for this project may need to incorporate information from a diverse set of original data sources which is facilitated by Bayesian inferential techniques, another growing subdiscipline of the statistical sciences.  In addition, the data set assembled for this project is very large and will require the analyst to have considerable facility with programming and handling large datasets in order for it to be possible to accomplish on time and within budget.
We have identified a further set of statistical analyses for this project that would allow us to meet the goals of the overall project that need to be accomplished once the current set of deliverables under contract P9836110003 are completed.  Because of the familiarity of Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting with the data for the project, and their proven ability to provide high-quality, timely deliverables under the current contract, it would be a direct and tangible benefit to the Government to award this second contract to Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting. In addition, our direct experience from the previously advertised contract was that Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting was the sole qualified contractor to bid on the project and this is a logical follow-on to the existing contract.  
1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: FAR 13.104 and 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  There were five criteria we considered in choosing an appropriate contractor:1. High level of performance in current contract and thus detailed familiarity and proven ability to produce sophisticated analyses using data structures in place for current project with very large and complicated dataset. Any other contractor would require considerable time to gain familiarity with this data set, costing the Govt. funds.2. Previous advertisement for consulting contract for this project only produced a single qualified applicant - Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting, a new competition for continuing analyses would likely have the same results.3. Mastery of spatial, classical and Bayesian statistics for development of spatially-explicit species distribution models 4. Very strong background in vegetation ecology of Alaskan ecosystems and ecological factors affecting the distribution of plants 5. Location in Fairbanks to facilitate frequent consultation during development phase of program6. Ability to work well with NPS staff  collaborator and a strong  interest in the subject of the project
Dr. Jay Ver Hoef is the only contractor who meets all the requisite criteria-and in fact exceeds them.  We have had nothing but excellent results working with Dr. Ver Hoef in the current project. In addition, this is a follow-on contract to a previously competed contract, in which Dr. Ver Hoef was the only offeror.	2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs 
NPS seeks three  major items from the Contractor:a. Perform statistical analyses and create spatial models that identify the important ecological  attributes that control distribution and abundance for a set of 400 plant species, including mosses, lichens and vascular plants using a set of detailed covariate data from the Denali plot network- including soils parameters such as soil pH, organic layer depth, and nitrogen and carbon content.b. Set-up data analysis routines in R-statistical package that will allow us to integrate these additional analysi s routines into the web-based R-0Server statistical package that is currently sever on the UAF nuna web-server that the Supercomputing Center of UAF.  This work will allow NPS employees to continue to use the statistical routines created by Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting as new data are acquired.  Work with University personnel to ensure that analysis routoines work as designed on the web-based server.c. Provide concise, coherent and cogent written text describing specific statistical methods used for the data analyses described in the items above above.
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  Dr. Ver Hoef has the unique qualifications that he has spent considerable time and effort working with the project data very successfully to date.  He was the sole qualified applicant for the original contract advertisement, and it is certain the same situation would result from a new advertisement due to the similarities in requirements for the new set of work.  In addition, the Government will save funds due to this contractor's high degree of familiarity with the current project.  Any other contractor would require time to become familiar with the project data and would require time of the Govt. to provide background, which Ver Hoef Statistical Consulting will not require due to the fact that this is a follow-on contract, which will also result in a cost savings to the Government.
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:   We advertised for three weeks for the current contract (with very similar types of requirements and skills the new set of duties will require) and received a single qualified offeror, we seek to award this follow-on contract to Ver Hoef Satatistical Consulting, which would save the Government considerable time and funds.
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  All actions have been taken by the Government to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for required supplies or services.

Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large scale construction projects.  (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: 52.222-23 "Notice of Requirement for Project labor Agreement Clause 52.222-32 "Project Labor Agreement."<br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>(1)	Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in San Bernardino County, CA?<br>(2)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3)	Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4)	What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5)	What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6)	What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA?<br>(7)	What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include a PLA provision in a Los Angeles District contract?<br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposals and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested parties must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.  Responses should be received prior to 2:00 PM local time on 28 February 2012.<br><br>Responses should be sent to:<br><br>US Army Corps of Engineers<br>Contracting Division<br>ATTN:  Lucia A.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price.

Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the <br />Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award.

Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 16 Apr 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patients condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veterans care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 53 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III).  A description of the RUG-III systems can be found in 42 CFR Parts 409, et.al.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing homes Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patients stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.

In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VAs request.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Solicitation number HSCG38-12-Q-300015 is assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a total Small Business Set-side. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Firm fixed price quotes are requested for the Overhaul of the following equipment:</p>

The Original Equipment Manufacturer of the equipment is GOODRICH INC. Cage Code 17576. This equipment is used on the USCG HC-130H aircraft and is Flight Critical and Serial number tracked.</p>
<p><br />Description of the Requirement: Overhaul prices shall include all replacement parts required by the AFTO. All replacement parts shall be new with traceability back to the OEM. The Coast Guard does not intend to provide replacement parts as Government Furnished Material in performance of the requirement. The contractor shall be required to submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer once equipment has been received verifying the actual Part Numbers, NSN's and Serial Numbers on the equipment. The information on the equipment should mirror the information on the Purchase Order. The written notification shall identify any discrepancies between the equipment and the Purchase Order. Equipment received that indicates obvious misuse, cannibalization or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage are considered exclusions and will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Over and above work outside the direction of the AFTO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as "over-and-above". In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with Purchase Order Number, Line Item Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, NSN, and Serial Number. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipping, handling and storage. Preservation and protection shall be provided to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one (1) year. The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is a supply depot, therefore material will be stored and transshipped to various users. The container shall be packed and labeled suitable for shipment via land, air or sea. Packaging material shall NOT consist of popcorn material, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type or peanut packaging. Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.</p>

The contractor must be able to obtain the AFTO including any applicable service bulletins. All parts are Flight Critical and serial number tracked. The contractor must be able to provide a Certificate of Conformance and, if permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a certificate of airworthiness for each piece of equipment overhauled. Offerors and any subcontractor to be used in performance of the required work shall be either OEM Certified or be an FAA Approved/Certified Repair Station. Offerors are required to submit evidence of a valid OEM Certification or FAA Certification showing authorization to affect overhaul of all parts. Expired or pending certifications are not acceptable and will render an offeror's quotation as not technically acceptable.</p>
<p>The required Delivery time frame is no later than 45 days after receipt of equipment. Earlier deliveries are acceptable providing there is no additional cost to the Government. Equipment shall be shipped to the USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section Bldg 63, Weeksville Rd., Elizabeth City, NC 27909.

Origin, Freight Prepaid quotes MUST include an estimate of shipping costs which will be added to the price quote for price evaluation purposes to arrive at the total cost to the Government.</p>
<p>All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Because this acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-aside, quotations from Large Businesses will not be considered.</p>
<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses are incorporated:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (June 2008)</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items is not applicable to this solicitation. In lieu of this provision the following evaluation procedures shall be used: Quotes will be evaluated and a purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: Quotes must include copies of the following documents to be technically acceptable; 1) Copy of the AFTO cover sheet, 2) Copy of a valid FAA Certification or an OEM Certification, 3) a statement identifying subcontractor the prime contractor intends to use with a copy of the subcontractor's FAA or OEM Certification.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;</p>
<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

Technician will also install a new crankshaft seal, jacket water pump, sea water pump, air start solenoid &amp; repair lube oil leaks on turbo oil line on board the USCGC Bertholf.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 3 January 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events on weekends during March 2012 (not including March 30 & 31, 2012). The attached pricing schedules may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A separate performance work statement (PWS) for each area (group) is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, and 52.252-1.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the two events cannot be held on the same weekend and the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. In addition, in considering the most advantageous scenario to the government with regards to the two events being held on two separate weekends, the following will be considered: If, as a result of this solicitation, responses are received for only one weekend in one of the areas (i.e. Area 2), and multiple dates are offered for the other area (i.e., Area 1), the sole weekend available in the one area (i.e. Area 2) will be eliminated from further consideration for the other area (i.e. Area 1).  Otherwise, an award will made to the lowest price technically acceptable vendor(s) on the dates determined to be the most advantageous to the government.<br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met for either area quoted:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in the Williamsburg, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, or Portsmouth, VA area (defined as Area 1); or, in or between Richmond, VA and Fredericksburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange north on I95 to Fredericksburg, VA) (defined as Area 2) and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in the Williamsburg, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, or Portsmouth, VA area (defined as Area 1); or, in or between Richmond, VA and Fredericksburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange north on I95 to Fredericksburg, VA) (defined as Area 2) and.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost.  For minimum requirement (2), an information sheet addressing the number of parking spaces available at the event facility must be provided.  For minimum requirement (3), the physical location of the proposed event facility must be provided.<br><br>In order for the event to be advantageous to the government, the lodging and event facilities per area must be located within five (5) miles of each other.  Therefore, a lodging quote only or an event quote only, in which there is no second location (event or lodging facility) quoting, will not be considered for award. As such, event and lodging facilities are encouraged to partner with each other and either one entity quote the entire requirement and enter into a subcontracting arrangement for the portion they are unable to provide or both parties ensure each entity will be quoting separately.<br> <br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I shall be completed and returned with your offer.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <br><br>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.232-18, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).

 Offerors intending to deliver the SF 330 in person to the facility at the address above are cautioned that this NAVFAC Southwest facility is located in downtown San Diego.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions and answers in regards to Combined Synopsis / Solicitation G12PS00116 as follows:
Question 1: Is there travel involved with this contract?
Answer 1:  A contractor is not required to travel to obtain data they may need, because they can obtain the information online by coordinating with the Technical Liaison.  The old material is pre-online publication and therefore available, and there is nothing preventing potential contractors from obtaining technical material upon request.  Additionally if a contractor requires access to a USGS system, then the Technical Liaison can assist the contractor with obtaining special approval as needed. 
Question 2: "Technical Capability (to include technical excellence, management capability, personal qualifications, and experience)" - Does the word experience refer to the candidate's / person's experience or the company's experience?
Answer 2:  The candidate's experience. See Provision 52.212-02 and refer to the Statement of Work for additional information.
Question 3:  "Past Performance" - Does Past Performance need to be related to Seismic Data Services?
Answer 3:  Yes.
Question 4:  "Having an excellent knowledge of the seismic properties of the Earth's crust" - Does this pertain to the candidate  / person or the company?
Answer 4:  The candidate.
Question 5: Who is the incumbant? What was the value of the incumbant's contract for last year?
Answer 5: There is no incumbant. This is a new contract being contemplated.
The hour and date specified for receipt of offers is NOT extended.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the offer due date and time specified in the Combined Synopsis / Solicitation by email or with their offer.  All acknowledgements must reference the amendment number. FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY THE OFFER DUE DATE AND TIME, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.

<DESC>Questions: Do all of the rabbits have to be of the same strain, or would a mix be<br>acceptable? Covance recently purchased Myrtle Rabbits and therefore is able<br>to offer both Covance and Myrtle rabbits for sale.<br><br>Answer: The rabbit strain has to be New Zealand White.  Unfortunately both Covance and Myrtle (who are vendors and not strains) have rabbits with Bordetella spp in<br>their colonies and are not acceptable as a specific pathogen free research<br>rabbit.<br><br><br>Question: While it is noted in the RFP that weekly delivery is expected, is<br>there an expectation of a regular once a week delivery? If so, is there an<br>estimation of how many rabbits per week or per month will be needed? Is<br>there any flexibility regarding when rabbits can be delivered? <br><br>Answer: The vendor must be able to deliver at least once a week.  The number of<br>rabbits delivered and the delivery date will depend on the research<br>performed.  The importance is that the vendor will delivery weekly so that<br>if the investigator needs to order quickly to continue a study the mission<br>will not be delayed. <br> <br><br>Question: It is noted that rabbits are described in the RFP by weight. Is there<br>an age limit or age range expectation?<br><br>Answer: We order Rabbits by weight not by age.<br>

<DESC>BLM Invitation for Bids, L12PS00118- Wild Horse and Burro Horse Long Term Holding Request For Proposal (RFP) for the following requirement: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.

The objective for each LTP facility is to pasture a minimum of 400 up to a maximum of 2000 wild horses/burros. The intent is to provide a pasture (grassland) setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.    During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger and older adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. 		Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP), the BLM anticipates the award of one or more contracts.

The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks- Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a minimum of 400 up to a maximum of 2000 wild horses. The animals are to be grazed in grassland pastures that are capable of producing sufficient standing forage.  The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape without trimming.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant.  	Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis.  	Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.   Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  The facilities must be located in the Continental United States.

Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions. Please reference Section 6 of this document for information on obtaining these instructions. Additional cost information may be requested at a later date.</p>
<p>(1) For the classified submission, additional information regarding estimated life cycle costs is requested to be furnished for evaluation purposes.&nbsp; The estimated costs should cover the items listed in the template posted with this amendment to HQ0147-12-R-AWLR and identified as Attachment 3, AWL System Cost Element Structure.<br /><br />B. Schedule. Estimated schedule for the RDT&amp;E effort.</p>
<p>C. Proof of Principle Flight Demonstration Plans. Estimated schedule, cost, and risk for conducting a flight demonstration within 3 years.</p>
<p>D. Data Rights and Assertions.</p>
<p>E. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Risks.</p>
<p>(1) Overall TRL and substantiating evidence to support assessment of TRL.</p>
<p>(2) TRL of major system components and interfaces and substantiating evidence to support the given component TRL assessment(s).</p>
<p>(3) Test demonstration. Description of any near-term demonstrations which would provide the capability to observe targets of opportunity, determine target state estimates, and compare these estimates with the actual target states (test range developed, best estimate).</p>
<p>(4) Technical risks.</p>
<p>F. System Considerations.</p>
<p>(1) Kinematic intercept capabilities/envelope against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight (boost, mid-course, and terminal) as specified in the classified exemplar threat trajectories package.</p>
<p>(2) Operating area for each interceptor against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight as specified in the exemplar threat trajectories.</p>
<p>(3) Time-to-launch, given threat notification.</p>
<p>(4) Alternative missions or engagement regimes supported.</p>
<p>G. Sensor and Integrated Sensor Approach Performance. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 1: Sensor Performance Template.</p>
<p>H. Interceptors. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 2: Interceptor Performance Template.</p>
<p>I. Integration. Approach should address all integration issues for the sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications system.</p>
<p>J. Opportunities to leverage other programs to reduce cost, accelerate schedule, and/or fill multiple missions.</p>
<p>4. Industry Days. Industry Day Briefing Charts will be made available in early Jan 2012.&nbsp; MDA and the Air Force will host AWL Industry Days on 12-13 December 2011.

<DESC>Special Notice. OIS-12-074
<p>NAICS Code: 518210</p>
<p>Response Date: January 31, 2012</p>
<p>Subject: Sole Source Bridge Contract with Akamai Technologies for Public Web Site Content Delivery and Continuity of Operations Services</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Akamai Technologies, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts by January 31, 2012 for continuation of critical operational services to maintain and expand assistance to distribute and deliver HTTP content and provide COOP services for the NRC Public Web Site (www.nrc.gov). NRC currently has a contract that expires on January 31, 2012 for these services, and Akamai Technologies is the provider of those services. NRC intends to award a "bridge" contract to Akamai Technologies for continuation of those critical services so that it can ensure that there is no interruption in those services while NRC conducts additional market research to determine appropriate acquisition strategy for a longer-term requirement. The services under the bridge contract will include continued website caching, backup and spidering, content delivery, application scripting, monitoring, reporting tools, and automatic fail-over capabilities 24 hours a day, 365 day a year. The NRC anticipates a firm-fixed-price contract with a period of performance of one year, starting on February 1, 2012, and one (1) six-month option to extend the term of the contract. The authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)( 1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Based on NRC's current market research, Akamai Technologies is uniquely qualified to perform NRC's requirements because of the following:</p>
<p>CURRENT COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT (FISMA) OF 2002</p>
<p>The contractor must comply with the requirements for a Moderate risk system as defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-60, Revision 1. Because only domestic (U.S.) companies can be held to FISMA requirements, the company must also be U.S. held. Akamai Technologies holds a current FISMA-moderate certification by at least one U.S. Federal cabinet-level department for requirements materially similar to those of the NRC for this acquisition. Akamai is also an early partner in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) initiative sponsored by the U.S. Federal Chief Information Officer to develop a common baseline for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services to reduce the cost or redundant agency security assessments. By participating in the FedRAMP initiative, Akamai has demonstrated its continued commitment to maintaining its FISMA certification in a manner that is cost-effective for its Federal clients. Based on NRC's market research (discussion with other agencies, professional knowledge of the industry, internet searches), the NRC has found no other source besides Akamai Technologies that can provide a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with a current FISMA-Moderate certification or that participates in the FedRAMP initiative.</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE OF LAST MILE DELIVERY</p>
<p>The NRC requires market penetration to ensure that all public site content reaches the Internet Service Provider (ISP) of the end user accurately for users in every country around the world. Akamai Technologies provides end-to-end delivery and control of content with proprietary algorithms that connect over 95,000 Akamai servers strategically distributed in 71 countries on 1,900 networks. Eighty-five percent of all Internet users are within a single "network hop" of an Akamai server to ensure "last-mile" delivery. Based on its market research, NRC has found no other source for a CDN that can demonstrate the ability verify the arrival of NRC content in the ISP of the end user.</p>
<p>CONFIDENCE OF LAST MILE REMOVAL</p>
<p>The NRC requires programmatic tracking and control of all content delivered by or cached on the contractor's CDN servers in host ISPs such that any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) found at the public site can be removed from all of the contractor's CDN servers in networks world-wide at the client's request. In order to ensure that content requested by the NRC for removal from the public site is in fact purged from ISP servers, the CDN must retain control of that content while at the ISP. Otherwise, if the content is passed to an externally controlled server, the CDN loses control of the content. Akamai Technologies retains control of the content by delivering it using proprietary algorithms on its own CDN servers co-located in the host ISP, rather than relying on the servers of an external partner to deliver the content to the user's ISP. This ensures that Akamai retains control of the cached content until shortly before it reaches the end user. Thus, when content is scheduled for removal or refresh by the NRC, Akamai retains the ability to remove or refresh the content (and to verify the task is complete) at most ISPs worldwide. Based on its market research, NRC has found no other source besides Akamai Technologies that can provide a CDN that can demonstrate the ability to verify the removal of NRC content from the ISPs of most end users.</p>
<p>In addition, the NRC has invested substantial time and effort in the existing configuration and FISMA certification for the Akamai Technologies CDN to support the NRC delivery requirements. The effort needed to migrate, configure, certify for FISMA compliance, and test a new CDN implementation would be cost-prohibitive and would place at risk the NRC's effort to achieve IPv6 compliance for the public site by the OMB-mandated deadline of September 30, 2012. Therefore, awarding this bridge contract acquisition any other source besides Akamai Technologies would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. And, as stated above, NRC's market research revealed no other sources besides Akamai Technologies that can satisfy NRC's requirements.</p>

<p>PROJECT: New United States Courthouse - Los Angeles, California<br />BUILDING TYPE: Courthouse and Federal Office Building<br />SIZE: 600,000 GSF<br />PARKING SPACES: 110 Controlled-Access Structured Parking <br />BUDGET: ECCA $322,000,000<br />GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: State of California<br />SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: None</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, engineers, and construction professionals to design and construct federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, durability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design and Construction services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, security requirements, and achieve at least a LEED Gold certification. This facility will be designed in English units.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a negotiated Design-Build (DB) construction contract for the new United States Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA. This acquisition encompasses the design and construction of the offices and related space (courtrooms, chambers and other special use space) as required for the U.S. District Court; U.S. Marshals Service; GSA field office; Department of Homeland Security - Federal Protective Service; and trial preparation space for the Office of the U.S. Attorney, and the Federal Public Defender. The facility includes 110 controlled-access, non-public parking spaces inside the completed structure. The newly constructed courthouse shall be located on GSA owned property, on a site between Broadway, Hill, First and Second Streets in the Civic Center area of downtown Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>The total space requirement consists of approximately 600,000 gross square feet, available for use by the federal government for personnel, furnishings and equipment no later than March 2016. The building will be designed and constructed in English units. The estimated total design/build cost is between $312,000,000 and $322,000,000 with occupancy planned for the year 2016. The scope of required Design/Build Services may include, but not be limited to, the following: design/construction documents and construction work, which consists of providing all labor, equipment, and materials for a complete build-out of the Federal Courthouse. The facility will have substantial electrical and HVAC requirements.</p>
<p>The selection process will utilize the Best Value Tradeoff process as stipulated within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures in Subpart 36.3 of the FAR. This project is an opportunity in Design and Construction Excellence that must integrate the building into the fabric of the surrounding community and create a new Federal landmark in the heart of Los Angeles that represents the dignity of the U.S. Government. The courthouse must express solemnity, integrity, rigor and fairness.</p>
<p>The selection process will include two phases: <br />&bull; Phase I, the Request For Qualifications (RFQ) leading to selecting a short list of 3 Design-Build offerors, who will be invited to participate in:<br />&bull; Phase II, the comprehensive Request for Proposal (RFP) competition and selection of the design/build offeror.</p>
<p>In Phase II, offerors will be invited to submit a proposal subject to PLA requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both. If a PLA proposal is accepted by GSA, the apparent successful offeror shall be required, as a pre-condition to award, to execute and deliver to the contracting officer a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) meeting the minimum requirements of the Solicitation.</p>
<p>A single, firm, fixed-price contract with award fee may be awarded for all design beyond a program of requirements and all construction services. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. In consideration for the preparation of the Phase II proposal, GSA will pay a stipend to the two non-selected offerors.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal.</p>
<p>Consideration is open to established, qualified firms licensed to perform professional services (FAR 22.1102 and 22.1103), which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United States (including subcontractors).</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about February 6, 2012 on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference is scheduled:</p>
<p>Date: February 22, 2012</p>
<p>Time: 1:00 p.m. PST</p>
<p>Location: 300 North Los Angeles Street<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suite 8529&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Los Angeles, CA 90012</p>

Mellon Auditorium available to the public under the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976.&nbsp; The&nbsp;contractor is required to advertise the auditorium, book event requests, and provide event-related coordination and services.<br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br /><br />This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services.&nbsp; A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the public to utilize the Andrew W.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>It was found that there was only one contractor that provided the type of equipment needed for the LCF-1600 Firearms and Tool marks comparison microscope and the Document Examination microscopes.  The contractor is Leeds Forensic Systems, Inc.  The microscopes that were requested are specific to the existing equipment that had been previous used during training the Afghanistan Security Forces that are currently in place.  There are currently no equal items that would satisfy the mission requirement.  It was determined that the only other alternate solution to meet the mission requirement would be to completely replace the existing equipment with those from another vendor.
