<CONTACT>Olivia Adrian Contract Specialist 7037871151     Olivia.Adrian@mms.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS of not more than twenty (20) pages in length, for the study entitled "Beaufort Sea Mesoscale Meteorological Model".  MMS/DOI intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study that provides MMS with a Beaufort Sea Mesoscale Meteorological Model. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541620, "Environmental Consulting Services".  This pre-solicitation notice is being published in accordance with FAR 15.202, entitled "Advisory Multi-Step Process".  The result of this pre-solicitation notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a pre-solicitation for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the MMS.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements.   PURPOSE:  This study shall be conducted in two phases.  Provide a comprehensive plan and budget developed during the model evaluation efforts conducted during Phase I (FY 2006 and 2007) that shall lead to significant improvements in the prognostic capabilities of a mesoscale meteorological model for the coastal and offshore regions of the Beaufort Sea, from Barrow, Alaska to the Mackenzie delta, Canada. A preliminary model shall be deployed on MMS computers under Phase I (FY2006 and FY2007) with the final model deployed on MMS computers under Phase II, which begins in FY 2008. The mesoscale meteorological model shall account for sea breeze established by the land-ocean thermal gradients in summer, the orographic steering effects influenced in part by the Brooks Range, and account for the spatial variability of the along shore/shelf and cross-shelf near surface wind speed and direction at a preferred scale of less than 10km. The model shall be capable of running on MMS computers.   BACKGROUND:  The Beaufort Sea Outer Continental Shelf is likely subject to substantial along and cross shore gradients in the surface wind velocity with these gradients possibly involving changes in both wind speed and direction. At present, wind gradients are not estimated adequately from synoptic pressure fields or from mesoscale meteorological models used for the Beaufort Sea region.  In addition, these models don't capture the land and sea breeze effects during the summer months or accurately depict the orographic steering effects of the winds caused by the Brooks Range. It is the goal of this study to provide these and other improvements to a Beaufort Sea mesoscale meteorological model. Developing a high resolution mesoscale meteorological model for the Beaufort Sea shall aid in the interpretation of oil spill dispersal through better knowledge of surface current variability during the open water season; provide better methods to evaluate cross-shelf current exchange during periods of landfast ice cover and improve our understanding of sea ice dynamics, especially as it pertains to sea ice leads and breakouts of landfast ice during the winter months.  The MMS anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract for Phase I with an estimated total amount of between $300,000 and $350,000.   The anticipated period of performance is two years (24 months).  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   SCOPE OF WORK:   This requirement is for Phase I with the following scope of work: (1) Identify potential Scientific Review Board (SRB) candidates to review model products during the course of the study; (2) Contact non-MMS entities for the purpose of supporting the development of a mesoscale meteorological model for the Beaufort Sea, Alaska; (3) Compile a list of references that utilize a mesoscale meteorology model for the Beaufort Sea region in the form of research or operational efforts; (4) Summarize the most useful set of mesoscale meteorological models that could be used in this study to support MMS objectives; (4a) Document the capabilities of the mesoscale meteorological model that would best support MMS objectives for the subject study area; (4b) Summarize the most important data collection efforts for the study area that could be used to improve the selected mesoscale meteorological model and would support the project model development objectives; (5) Conduct sensitivity analysis for the selected mesoscale meteorological model and identify model code improvements, and additional data collection requirements; (6) Provide a phase II plan to develop a mesoscale meteorological model for the Beaufort Sea that shall meet MMS goals and objectives; and (7) Write a detailed plan and budget for Phase II which shall direct improvements to the mesoscale meteorological model for the subject study area and produce a superior model that provides substantial resolution enhancements that shall fulfill the MMS stated objectives.  As part of the Phase I effort, the contractor will submit a detailed recommended plan and estimated contract value for Phase II.  The Phase II effort will be awarded as a separate contract to the contractor who will accomplish Phase I contingent upon the contractor's ability to successfully meet the requirements of Phase I and MMS' determination and approval of the proposed approach, recommendations and proposed estimated budget for Phase II.  HOW TO RESPOND:  In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing your capabilities in writing to the address as shown below: an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience.   Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in synoptic and mesoscale modeling for the Beaufort Sea region, in the collection and analysis of such data that supports the model and other data components required to successfully run the model for the subject study area.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion or present involvement in projects comparable to this one, and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge and experience required is as follows: (1) your organizational experience and facilities capable to perform the prescribed work; and (2) specific references including contract number and project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number and Email address for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years (references will be checked).

<BR><BR>3.0	Delivery, Installation, and Acceptance
<BR>The Government will be partnering with contractors that support the daily operations of the ERDC MSRC throughout the delivery, installation, and acceptance process.
<BR>After award, the Offeror shall coordinate with the Government Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to ensure knowledge of, understanding of, and adherence to site security policies and procedures during delivery, installation, and acceptance. Offeror installation/support personnel visiting the ERDC MSRC site are required to be U.S. citizens.
<BR><BR>3.1	Delivery
<BR>The Offeror is strongly encouraged to conduct a full-system burn-in and functional testing according to their standard quality assurance procedures prior to system shipment.
<BR>The Offeror shall ship the SVS onsite to the ERDC MSRC with prepaid shipping.  The Offeror shall unpack the system as shipped, assemble the SVS, power the system on, and boot the system to a functioning operating system.  At this point, the system will be considered delivered.
<BR><BR>3.2	Installation
<BR>The Government desires to minimize, where appropriate and possible, the length of time between delivery and production use of the proposed system.  Accordingly, the Offeror shall permit access to and use of the system by designated ERDC MSRC Government and contractor personnel during installation and both prior to and during the Acceptance Test as described in paragraph 3.3.1.  The Government recognizes that such access/use needs to be explicitly coordinated with the Offeror in advance of access/use.
<BR>Beginning the first business day following delivery, the Offeror shall provide at least two consecutive business days of onsite installation support for the system.  This installation support will allow for operating system and software configuration changes in coordination with ERDC MSRC staff to ensure the system meets DoD HPCMP and ERDC MSRC configuration and security requirements.  During this time, ERDC MSRC staff shall load Government furnished software on the system, including the software specified in 2.2.8 – 2.2.16, HPCMP Kerberos, HPCMP SSH (http://kirby.hpcmp.hpc.mil), and Platform FTA, in coordination with Offeror personnel.  ERDC MSRC staff shall then run Government security scans on the system.  Once Government security scans have been run successfully as determined by ERDC MSRC security personnel, ERDC MSRC staff shall connect the system to the ERDC MSRC network.  At this point, the system shall be considered installed.
<BR>Due to site security requirements, Offeror personnel will not be able to access the system once it is installed, i.e. connected to the ERDC MSRC network.
<BR><BR>3.3	Acceptance
<BR>Beginning the first business day following installation, the Offeror and Government shall begin consecutive business days of onsite acceptance test demonstration for the system according to the following Acceptance Test definition.
<BR><BR>3.3.1	Acceptance Test (AT)
<BR>The Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) is defined as the document, developed and submitted by the Offeror and approved by the Government, which defines the individual tests, test procedures, and expected test results which will be used to conduct the Acceptance Test.
<BR>The Acceptance Test (AT) is defined as the execution of the individual tests contained in the ATP by the Offeror and the Government or a designated Government agent, the results of which are recorded in a copy of the approved ATP and acknowledged by both the Offeror and Government in writing.
<BR>The Government expects the Offeror to develop the ATP without impact to the existing resources of the ERDC MSRC.  After award, the Offeror shall consult the COTR concerning any questions, coordination with ERDC MSRC staff, and planned activities at the ERDC MSRC.  The Offeror should address all correspondence related to the ATP to the GSA Contracting Officer and COTR.
<BR>The purpose of the AT is two-fold:  to demonstrate that all components of the system can function as an inter-working system, and to verify that the inter-working system can meet minimum performance and functionality criteria defined in the ATP.
<BR>The ATP shall consist of, at a minimum, the tests at 3.3.1.1 – 3.3.1.8, detailed test procedures that define how each test will be conducted, and the expected result(s) for each test:
<BR><BR>3.3.1.1	Demonstrate that the system can be brought to an orderly halt while preserving the file systems.
<BR>3.3.1.2	Demonstrate that files can be exchanged between the SVS and another HPC system.
<BR>3.3.1.3	Demonstrate that the system supports X Windows clients, and OpenGL.
<BR>3.3.1.4	Demonstrate that the system supports C, C++, and FORTRAN.
<BR>3.3.1.5	Demonstrate that the system supports C and FORTRAN bindings for MPI over the Gigabit Ethernet and Infiniband networks.
<BR>3.3.1.6	Demonstrate that each commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or open-source package may be executed on the SVS and the results displayed.
<BR>3.3.1.6.1	Computational Engineering International (CEI) Ensight 
<BR>3.3.1.6.2	CEI Enliten.
<BR>3.3.1.6.3	CEI Envideo.
<BR>3.3.1.6.4	Kitware Paraview.
<BR>3.3.1.6.5	MSC Patran.
<BR>3.3.1.6.6	Tecplot, Inc. Tecplot.
<BR>3.3.1.6.7	RSI, Inc. IDL.
<BR>3.3.1.6.8	Mathworks MATLAB.
<BR>3.3.1.6.9	NEROLinux.
<BR>3.3.1.7	Demonstrate that the system meets minimum performance criteria.
<BR>3.3.1.7.1	The CPU capabilities will be tested by running the default POVRay benchmark (Benchmark.pov) for a 320x240 image size that will be completed in less than 7 minutes. 
<BR>3.3.1.7.2	The graphics capabilities will be tested by running glxgears and achieving a rate higher than 12,000 frames per second.
<BR>3.3.1.7.3	The network I/O capabilities will be tested by running npserver/npclient.  The internal Gigabit Ethernet performance will be at least 110 MB/sec.  The internal Infiniband network performance will be at least 200 MB/sec.  It is understood that TCP/IP network test for Infiniband is suboptimal.
<BR>3.3.1.7.4	The disk I/O capabilities will be tested.  The read performance will be at least 200MB/sec and the write performance will be at least 140MB/sec.
<BR>3.3.1.8	Demonstrate that the system supports IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack functionality.
<BR><BR>The Offeror shall submit the ATP to the Government (GSA Contracting Officer and COTR) no more than 30 calendar days after contract award and at least 21 calendar days prior to proposed system delivery.  The Government will acknowledge receipt, review the ATP document, and provide a consolidated set of comments as appropriate to the Offeror within 7 calendar days of acknowledged receipt of the draft.  The Offeror shall submit the final ATP to the Government (GSA Contracting Officer and COTR) for approval at least 7 calendar days prior to proposed system delivery.  In order for the AT to begin, the system must be installed (3.2) and a final version of the ATP must have been submitted to and approved by the Government in writing.
<BR>The system shall successfully meet the requirements defined in the approved ATP in order for the Government to accept the system.
<BR>The AT shall begin no later than the first business day following installation and may last up to five consecutive business days.  The AT shall begin with the execution of the first test in the approved ATP.  ERDC MSRC staff will conduct the AT in coordination with Offeror personnel.  Due to site security requirements, ERDC MSRC staff members will perform the actual keystrokes required to execute the AT.  The Offeror and the Government or designated Government agent will visually inspect the results of each test procedure as it is executed.  Actual results will be compared to the expected results in order to verify completion of the tests.  Any supporting documentation, such as system logs, diagnostic messages, or application output, will be submitted with the results of the tests.  During the AT, the Government may waive individual tests at its discretion.
<BR>In the event that the system does not successfully complete the AT within five consecutive business days of the commencement of the AT, the Offeror and the Government or Government’s agent shall determine the reason for the failure.  After correcting the failure in order to achieve a satisfactory result, which may require adding, substituting, or installing requisite hardware and/or software and performing services at no extra cost to the Government, the Offeror shall repeat the AT.  If corrections are required, ERDC MSRC staff will take the system off the ERDC MSRC network in order to allow the Offeror system access to make necessary corrections.  Once the Offeror has notified the Government that corrective actions are complete, ERDC MSRC staff will run security scans prior to reconnecting the system to the ERDC MSRC network.  The Government may, at its discretion, require the Offeror to repeat the AT in its entirety (including re-running tests previously passed) if it deems that the corrective actions taken to achieve a satisfactory result on a particular test necessitate that all tests be re-run.  If the Offeror has not successfully completed the AT within 30 consecutive calendar days of the initiation of testing, the Government may, at its discretion, refuse the system at no cost to the Government.  In this case, the Offeror will be responsible for the cost of restoring the ERDC MSRC facility and systems to their pre-installation configuration to include removing the Offeror system from the site.
<BR>The Date of Acceptance shall be the date on which the system has successfully passed all tests (in a single or multiple AT periods, at the Government’s discretion) proposed in the approved ATP.
<BR>The Offeror shall prepare and submit DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, along with a copy of the signed/completed ATP and a complete bill of materials documenting the tested configuration (Offeror-delivered hardware and software) to the Government COTR.  The Offeror shall include the following notes in section 16:
<BR>Scientific Visualization System (see attached bill of materials)
Date of Acceptance:  DD-MMM-YYYY
<BR>The COTR shall formally acknowledge acceptance and receipt of the system on the face of the DD Form 250 by signing and dating sections 21.b. and 22.  The Government shall not make payment on the system without formal COTR acceptance and receipt as described.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has a requirement for 80 NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters for operational deployment.  Of these 80 transmitters, 11 will be International Radio and Electronics Corporation (IREC) Model No. WRG300 NWR transmitters, 12 will be IREC Model No. WRG1000 NWR transmitters, 17 will be Armstrong Transmitter Corporation (Armstrong) Model No. G300 NWR transmitters, 3 will be Armstrong Model No. G1000 NWR transmitters, 3 will be 300 Watt NWR transmitters (no specific make or model number specified) and 34 will be 1000 Watt NWR transmitters (no specific make or model number specified).  Deliveries of the IREC and Armstrong model NWR transmitters will be made F.O.B. Destination to various locations within the United States commencing within two months after award.  Deliveries of the NWR transmitters that are not specified as to make and model number will be made F.O.B. Destination to the National Logistics Support Center in Kansas City, Missouri commencing not later than six months after award.  The reason for specifying make and model numbers for certain of the NWR transmitters is due to the savings associated with maintaining the existing logistics and maintenance infrastructure already in place at the geographic locations where these NWR transmitters will be deployed.  Introducing new make and model number NWR transmitters to these locations would result in the incurrence of additional support costs outweighing the value of competition for the NWR transmitters for these sites.  Solicitation DG133W-RP-0154 will be issued on or about June 5, 2006 and will close on or about July 5, 2006.  Interested parties are advised that this procurement is an interim measure and that a larger procurement of NWR transmitters spanning several years is expected to take place during Government Fiscal Year 2007.  See Notes 2, 12, and 26.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a sole-source, no-cost purchase order to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 330, Marina del Rey, CA  90292.  The period of performance for this effort will be five years, with a one-year base period and four one-year options.  The Government will award this purchase order on July 17, 2006.  

The Contractor shall support the operation of the Internet and its domain name and numbering system (DNS) by performing three, interdependent technical Internet coordinating functions, known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  In support of the operation of the Internet DNS, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to perform the following services.  First, the Contractor shall coordinate the assignment of technical protocol parameters.  This function involves the review and assignment of unique values to numerous parameters (e.g., operation codes, port numbers, object identifiers, protocol numbers) used in various Internet protocols.  This function also includes dissemination of listings of assigned parameters through various means (including on-line publication) and the review of technical documents for consistency with assigned values.  Second, the Contractor shall perform administrative functions associated with root management.  This function primarily involves facilitation and coordination of the root zone of the Internet DNS.  It includes receiving requests for and making routine updates of the country code top level domain contact and nameserver information. Third, the Contractor shall allocate Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) delegations of Internet Protocol (IP) address space.  This function includes delegation of IP address blocks to regional registries for routine allocation, typically through downstream providers, to Internet end-users within the regions served by those registries.  It also includes reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications.  

This procurement is being conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. § 253(c)(1) – only one responsible source, which applies when the services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of service will satisfy the agency’s needs.  The IANA functions have been performed under contract with the Government for more than 25 years, previously under the auspices of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  As DARPA’s contract with the University of Southern California (USC) neared expiration in 1999, the Government recognized the need for the continued performance of the IANA functions as vital to the stable and secure technical functioning of the Internet and developed a transition plan for this responsibility.  On December 24, 1998, USC entered into a transition agreement with ICANN under which ICANN secured directly from USC all necessary resources, including key personnel, intellectual property, and computer facility access critical to the continued performance of the IANA functions.  Having assumed these key resources (as well as other responsibilities associated with privatization of the Internet DNS management through its Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Commerce), the Department of Commerce determined that ICANN was uniquely positioned to undertake performance of these functions and entered into a contract with ICANN.   The Department has issued three sole source contracts to ICANN under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to perform the IANA functions:  February 8, 2000; March 21, 2001; and March 13, 2003.  The current contract with ICANN expires on September 30, 2006. 

Offeror’s who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the requirements detailed above.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit the agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than ten (10) days after publication of this synopsis.  See government-wide numbered note 22.  A copy of the Statement of Work is available on NTIA’s website at www.ntia.doc.gov.

All responses to this synopsis may be submitted via e-mail to Brendon Johnson, Contracting Officer, at bjohnson@doc.gov, with a copy to Carol Silverman, Contracting Officer, at csilverman@doc.gov.  A hard copy shall be provided to the U. S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management and Financial Assistance, Commerce Acquisition Solutions Division, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 6521, Washington, DC  20230.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. The purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information is to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace, obtain information on available technology and and gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices. Because of the necessity of access to proprietary software (developed and owned by Black Dog Engineering Group), the government anticipates the competition will be limited to the software developer/owner, and the following vendors (who are believed to have entered into a nondisclosure agreement with the software developer/owner): ZedaSoft, Inc. (Ft. Worth, TX) SGI Federal (Plano, TX) Southwest Research Institute (SRI) (San Antonio, TX) All qualified sources capable of satisfactory performance of the anticipated requirements are invited to express interest via response to this market survey/RFI. Attachment A describes the performance requirements that must be addressed.  Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are required to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for upgrade of the Advanced General Aviation Medical Research Simulator (AGARS).   Responses must also include a completed Business Declaration form. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 15 pages taking into account the page count limitations specified in Attachment B.

All responses, including attachments, should be submitted in either Microsoft Word, or portable document format (pdf).  Also please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per e-mail, therefore responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received.

14.	In Room 16A, tap transformer output terminals and extend 4#4, and 1#8G, in 1-inch EMT to the existing 225-amp panel-board in Room 16A.  Remove the existing main breaker from the existing 225-amp panel-bard and install a 3-pole 50-amp main circuit breaker. The existing panel-board is lightly loaded, with only about four circuits, and, the intent is to limit the load that this panel-board can place on the transformer.       

15.	The transformer is a separately-derived system – and shall be grounded per NEC 250.30.  From neutral stud of the transformer, install one, bare, 2/0, copper grounding electrode conductor, 
un-spliced, from Room 16A, to the 5th floor electrical closet, then, down the stack of closets, to the main switch-bard room, connecting this GEC conductor to the building grounding electrode system. This grounding electrode conductor must be un-spliced from the transformer on the 5th floor to the grounding electrode connection on the 1st floor. If deficiencies are perceived to exist in the building grounding-electrode-system, notify the Government.


16.	In Room 16A, in the transformer output feeder run, install one 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, enclosed, circuit-breaker, to protect the feeder conductors and protect the transformer. Lock this circuit breaker in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

17.	In computer room, install 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, safety switch – coordinating location with the Tenant Agency and Representatives of the Contracting Officer. Coordination is required here. Equipment exists in the computer room work areas - that must be removed in a phased manner. Lock this safety switch in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

18.	From near-by room on the 5th floor, transport an existing UPS by-pass switch in to the computer room and place in final location. This weight of this item is not deemed excessive and this item may be placed on the existing raised flooring.     

19.	Examine two additional pieces of existing UPS equipment, in a nearby 5th floor room, and, design and fabricate a steel support stand to support these two pieces of equipment in the computer room. Recent inspection time on site time did not permit a detailed examination or design for this support stand. Some time will be required on site determine the exact locations of equipment to be installed in the computer room and coordinate the design of an adequate support stand with the existing raised flooring that must be removed and determine base runner arrangements that can distribute the weight over a wide area. The Contractor can spend this time on site and investigate all site conditions – in coordination with GSA, and the Tenant Agency. 

  	The Contractor shall measure the two existing pieces of UPS equipment and prepare a sketch of a proposed steel stand to be placed on the concrete flooring in the computer room to support these two UPS items: one stand will be fabricated to support these two heavy UPS items. The stand will include the following features.           
(1) 	Distribute the weight of the two UPS items, evenly, along the concrete flooring under the existing raised flooring – over a foot-print much greater than the combined foot-print of the two UPS items.     
(2) 	Construct support system with angle iron with minimum dimensions of 5”x 5” x required lengths.  
(3) 	Provide two main base runs of angle iron that extended under the un-disturbed raised flooring at least four feet on two sides of the UPS equipment - beyond the foot print of the supported equipment. The total length of these two base runners will be the width of the footprint of the UPS equipment plus an additional eight feet – four feet on each side of the UPS equipment for and estimated total length of 12 feet. These two main base runners can be placed under the existing raised flooring, one at a time, then, the remainder of the support system set in place, on the runners, and bolted to the runners forming one rigid support system. This approach will distribute the weight over a wide area. Permanent removal of existing raised-flooring will occur in an amount slightly larger than the footprint of the two UPS equipment items. 
(4) 	The support system will contain a raised section that is a little larger than the foot-print of the two UPS items, and, will coordinate with the removal of raised floor tiles. The top of this raised support will be at the same elevation as the adjacent raised flooring. 
(5) 	The support system shall permit bottom conduit access into each of the UPS equipment items.
(7) 	Permit ventilation under the raised flooring to reach the UPS equipment. 
(8)	Prior to fabricating this support, prepare sketches and submit to the Government for review. Show in plan view the existing raised flooring that will be permanently removed.  Show the support system in its final position with the existing surrounding raised flooring abutting the support. Show elevation views viewing each side of the support system – viewed from beneath the raised flooring. Show a frontal elevation view of the UPS equipment in place resting upon the support system. GSA architects and structural engineers will review these sketches adequacy and décor. An Architect would be helpful in the preparation of these sketches. Record on the sketches the weight of each piece of equipment. Each weight is on the name-plate data of the equipment. 
(9)	Paint the entire metal support system with three coats of a, durable, black, enamel paint, selected to approximate the color of the UPS equipment.   	

(10)	After approval of a design for the support stand, portions of the stand should be fabricated off-site, then, brought into the computer room for final assembly. Final assembly must be accomplished using bolts. Welding will not be permitted. 

20.	Transport the two remaining pieces of UPS equipment, from a 5th floor office area into the computer room – placing on the support stand. The battery cabinet shall be transported with out batteries. Examine the conduit knock-outs to determine proper placement for the installation of interconnect conduits – coordinating with US Coast Guard Personnel to verify the orientation of these two cabinets. It is believed that that the battery cabinet should be placed to the left of the UPS cabinet – when viewed from the front. 

21.	Interconnect the battery cabinet and the UPS cabinet with liquid-tight flex conduit – sized to the knock-outs in the cabinets. 

22.	From transformer in Room 16A, via enclosed CB, extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and , and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the nearby computer room – traveling under the raised floor in the computer room, and rising into the following safety switch.  Extend neutral, un-spliced, through the disconnect switch, into the by-pass cabinet. The neutral is sized @ 173% of the phase-conductor capacity shown on the UPS name-plate data.    	      

23.	From safety switch in computer room extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and, and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the by-pass switch cabinet. Do not make connection in the by-pass cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor. 

24.	From by-pass switch cabinet, install two runs of 4-inch, liquid-tight flex conduit, to serve the UPS cabinet, with bottom feed. In each flex run, install 3#400 MCM phase conductors,  
1#700 MCM neutral, and 1#3 ground. [These are nominal sizes, based upon abbreviated APC literature. The Contractor shall consult with US Coast Guard Personnel and obtain a name and contact for APC – the Manufacturer of the UPS equipment and coordinate conductor sizes down stream of the by-pass switch cabinet with APC Technical Personnel- retaining name and telephone number of the APC Personnel providing the information. ]   Do not make connections in the by-pass cabinet or the UPS cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor.     

25.	In computer room in location coordinated with GSA and the U. S. Coast Guard, install a new, 
225-amp, main-breaker, 42-pole panel-board, non-linear panel-board, with 225-amp main breaker.   
This panel will include a 200% neutral bus, isolated ground terminals and equipment ground terminals. 

26.	From UPS unit, to new 225-amp panel-board, install 3# 4/0 phase conductors, 1#500MCM neutral, 1#4G, in 3-inch LT flex conduit.   

27.	The UPS unit is considered a separately-derived system and must be grounded as such: the neutral must be grounded in the same manner as the neutral in the 112.5KVA transformer in Room 16A. 
	Either in the UPS unit or in the 225-amp panel-board, cadweld a bare #4 grounding-electrode-conductor to the 500MCM neutral and extend this bare GEC conductor into Room 16A, cadwelding the #4 GEC to the #2 GEC that serves the 112.5KVA transformer. The GEC is not required to be in conduit, but, must be protected. Route under raised floor, along walls, protecting with PVC conduit in congested areas.   

28.	One circuit at a time, and in coordination with the US Coast Guard, transfer about twenty existing branch circuits from an existing panel-board in the computer room – into the new UPS 
panel-board. Where the existing circuits are of in-sufficient length, replace the entire conduit and circuit run with new wire and LT flex conduit – of the proper size and phase arrangement.     
29.	One circuit at a time, and in coordination with the US Coast Guard, furnish and install approximately eight new branch circuits to serve computer equipment from the new 225-amp UPS  panel-board. 

30.	In coordination with the US Coast Guard, identify existing UPS and electrical equipment to be removed - after transition to new UPS system is complete. This equipment is understood to be the following:  
(1) 	25KVA transformer and associated conduit and wiring. Store transformer in building as directed. 
(2) 	Approximately 50KVA UPS system – including associated conduit and wiring. Store UPS equipment in building as directed.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

•	Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
•	The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
•	Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
•	Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
•	Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
•	Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
•	Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
•	Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals from organizations to provide Technical Assistance for Domestic Violence Assessment and Intervention for the Healthy Start Population. This is a Full and Open Competitive Requirement.  The NACIS Code is 541618 with a Small Business Standard of 6.0 million (to qualify as a small business). The contractor shall develop and provide technical assistance to enhance the capacity of primary care and perinatal care providers at Healthy Start sites and community-based intervention programs to assess perinatal  clients for current or past exposure to intimate partner violence and to effectively convey information about risk reduction and intervention services that are ulturally relevant and specific to their target population.  The technical assistance will be tailored to the specific community and program needs of each Healthy Start site and is provided to enhance the capacity of providers to screen for and educate their clients about family violence and to improve linkages between screening sites and community-based intervention programs for women experiencing family violence during or around the time of pregnancy.  One in three women in the United States will be abused by a current or former partner sometime during their lives. Pregnancy presents an important window of opportunity to identify domestic and family violence; the routine frequency of prenatal visits can facilitate a relationship of trust and support between the clinician and her/his client and the opportunity to promote change.  The health consequences of domestic violence include physical injury, disability, social, emotional and/or economic deprivation and death.  Moreover, the obstetric and perinatal outcomes associated with abuse include placental abruptions, preterm labor, preterm delivery, preterm rupture of membranes, inadequate maternal weight gain and low birth weight infants.Pregnancy has been identified as a potential period of increased risk for violence inflicted by intimate partners.  The prevalence of violence during pregnancy is estimated to range between 0.9 to 20.1 percent but a number of studies indicate a narrower range of 3.9 to 8.3 percent.  This indicates that pregnant women are more likely to experience violence than preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or placenta previa. The technical assistance (TA) provided shall include the following three components: (1) A needs assessment of the Healthy Start site that must include but not be limited to identifying the local prevalence of domestic violence and sexual abuse, strengths/weaknesses of current services provided at the site, screening rates, identification of personnel currently conducting domestic violence assessments and the Healthy Start site process of linking domestic violence screening to intervention services, current gaps in services that may be linked via technical assistance activities, identification of the appropriate staff to receive the TA training and assess the need for cultural diversity among the site providers and materials; (2) Development of a TA plan for enhancement of provider capacity to assess for domestic violence and for effective linkages between domestic violence assessment, perinatal services, primary care services and essential community intervention programs that are tailored to the population and practice setting.  To represent the consortium that must be present at the TA trainings, community intervention programs must include but not limited to women’s shelters, linkages with consortia that is representative of the target community, justice system, employee assistance programs, animal protection organizations and dental providers and (3) Two days of on-site TA to implement the TA plan with all the consortia represented.  The TA must be provided by at least one staff member with cultural expertise related to the majority population(s) served by the grant receiving TA. The contractor will assist each site in drafting a 90-day site action plan and provide follow-up via phone, on-site and/or electronic consultation to each site that receives TA.  The Government anticipates award of a contract consisting of a twelve month base period.    This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov within fifteen(15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations-Division of Procurement Management. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources.  The contact person for this acquisition is: Debora A. Pitts, Contracts Operations Branch, DPM/OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-3789 or 443-2750; FAX 301-443-6038.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of Financial Services(OFS), intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price purchase order to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to convert EPA hardcopy retirement cards into an electronic format according to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) latest file layout and continue conversion of the EPA Personnel/Payroll System (EPAYS) Master File into Extensible Markup Language (XML). EPAYS was a mainframe application written mainly in the PL/1  language with reports generated in SAS and FOCUS, and utilities coded in scripting languages: Clist and REXX. IBM Job Control Language (JCL), JobTrack, and Advanced Function Printing (AFP) have also been utilized in this system. The conversion of EPA Retirement Cards is a multilevel task that has  transitioned from the original source data developed in these computer languages which are no longer supportable and/or are "dead" computer languages. Fluency in non-supportable source language under EPAYS through the migration to EPA's current payroll system called PeoplePlus before final  migration to the Department of Defense Finance and Accounting System dictates proficiencies in the "dead" languages PL/1, SAS and FOCUS to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the requested conversion task. SAIC was the original developer of EPAYS and have been performing maintenance on the  system for over seven years as well as migration support services to PeoplePlus. Their history and unique familiarity with EPAYS and its supporting systems has provided them in-depth, thorough knowledge allowing them to make an immediate impact with a minimal learning curve and start-up costs.  Historically, newly assigned (but experienced) SAIC developers have taken several months to learn the functionality, programming, and structure of EPAYS and its support systems. Furthermore, SAIC has been involved in the preliminary planning and development for future mandates that are quickly  forthcoming as a result of the President's Management Agenda (PMA) mandated by OPM and other EPA initiatives. They made amazing progress toward meeting these upgrades being spurred on by the aggressive implementation dates. The NAICS code for this procurement will be 541511. The period of  performance will be June 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006. No Solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the  date of this announcement, will be considered. All updates, changes or other relevant information related to this procurement can be accessed at the following EPA Internet World Wide Web Site: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0600273/index.htm. Responses to this posting must be in  writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Tom Semones via email at Semones.Tom@epa.gov.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 40,222 rentable square feet of office and related space under a lease at the building located 111 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington DC. This lease, which expires, January 31, 2009 houses the Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  The Government has a requirement to expand the housing needs of this function by approximately 24, 000 rentable square feet of office and related space for an additional 9 years.  The new total rentable space must yield a minimum of approximately 55,900 ANSI/BOMA Office Area. The delineated area is three (3) walkable blocks of 111 Mass., Ave., NW, Washington, DC, within an area bounded by New Your Avenue, NW, on the North; North Capitol Street, NE, on the East; D Street, NW, on the South; and 6th Street, NW, on the West.


The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

The DTCI Pre-Proposal Conference is being conducted to provide interested parties the opportunity to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, to ensure offerors have a firm understanding of the solicitation requirements, and to address any other industry concerns or questions.  The following is a brief synopsis of the DTCI requirement.  Specific DTCI requirements will be identified in performance work statement to be included in the upcoming solicitation.

DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations/load optimization and mode conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DOD shippers.  An implementation approach is envisioned with multiple phases based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase I will begin with 18 Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) CONUS Defense Distribution Centers.  Phase II will include co-located service shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  Phase III will include additional service shippers throughout CONUS. The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfil those requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation Group has a requirement for equipment to be procured as a part of a concept demonstration exploration, which is examining emerging technologies in the area of data acquisition.  The equipment will be used to augment the existing concept demonstration system/program risk reduction measures.  The original concept demonstration was based on flight test equipment from Teletronics Technology Corporation (TTC), 5 Terry Drive, Newtown Pennsylvania 18940.  The technology area that the activity is adding is the IEEE-1588 Network Timing which is fairly new to flight test instrumentation.  There are four specific items that will be needed for this technology feasibility exploration. 1) ruggedized airborne electrical switch with a 1588 time master; 2) PCM bridge with a 1588 time reader, 3) video bridge with 1588 time reader, 4) Interface card to the existing concept demonstration system.

The intent of this procurement is to integrate the equipment into the existing concept demonstration system.  TTC is the manufacture of the equipment and is the sole proprietor of these items.  The integration of 1588 technology into the TTC system demonstration required TTC’s intellectual property.  These additional items must work integrally with the existing concept demonstration.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Satellite Control and Network Systems Group, SMC/SN, to solicit information from industry that will aid the SPO in assessing the state of the art in training/simulation systems that could be standardized to train satellite command and control operators.  Information obtained as a result of this posting may be used for the development of a future standardized training system at SMC for satellite command and control.  Currently, a prospective satellite operator is trained on a system that is unique to the satellite they will ultimately be flying.  This is costly in that numerous stovepipe training systems for the various missions must be developed and maintained.  To reduce cost, a new vision for training that is modeled after Air Force flight training is being investigated for implementation.  The new vision calls for a Standardized Space Trainer (SST) to be used at both IQT and Unit Training for AFSPC satellite operators.  Standardized hardware, system software and networking capabilities (crew & positional training and HLA compliance for distributed training) are the core concept of SST.  Software applications will be developed to execute system specific space ops unit training: GPS OCX, SBIRS, TSAT, etc applications would operate on Standardized Space Trainer just like opening Word, Excel, Photoshop, Quake, etc, on a desktop PC.  Additionally, development of software for Space IQT to train students to fly a simulated generic military satellite with basic on-board functions is desired. This training will provide students with an overview of military satellite systems and their ground systems; fundamentals of space flight, orbital mechanics, etc.; knowledge of on-board sub-systems common to all satellites (non-payload specific); and fundamentals for establishing satellite contacts and conducting telemetry, tracking & control operations on a generic satellite system.  After graduating from basic training, operators would be sent to specialized training where they will learn about specific mission satellites and how to perform command and control operations on them using the same training system.  The desired standardized training system would support both types of training and have the capability to be customized to provide a similar look and feel to the system that the students would ultimately be using.  This would imply a similar set of data displays, commanding functions, and a training fidelity satellite simulator modeled after the target system.  The standardized training system should be COTS based and provide an environment that is easily customizable.  In effect, the training system could consist of a PC with sufficient memory and speed, displays and a number of software applications running on an operating system that supports the basic and specialized training courses as well as different crew sizes and positions. 
The following information is requested: 
1)  Describe currently existing products that could be made to function as a standardized trainer for satellite command and control.  Indicate if your company would be prepared to demonstrate such products to the government for evaluation.
2)  Describe standard languages/tools that could be used by a developer to produce training-level satellite simulations that run under a standardized training environment.
3)  Describe industry standards that exist for human/machine interface regarding the display of satellite telemetry data and satellite commanding.
4)  If standards of items 2 and 3 do not exist, provide specific suggestions on how the Government might best develop such standards.
5)  Describe the ability of a standardized training system to accommodate positional, crew, and distributed training.
6)  Describe the ability of the user to modify training material, scenario scripts and system responses and basic error and/or fault injection for training scenarios to include automated trainee performance monitoring for evaluating training.
7)  We also invite industry to comment on specialized features that have the potential to enhance a standardized trainer through the use of:  3-D visualization to present a graphical view of the actions taken that effect the satellite operations; and intelligent tutoring agents, an overview of the environment (space and terrestrial) and the potential affects the environment can have on satellite operations to include C2 of the satellite, and basic operations. 

Questions/concerns regarding this RFI shall be sent, in writing, via e-mail to Business Contact, Maj. Eric Dale Winger, Phone (310) 653-4254, Fax (310) 653-1508, Email Dale.Winger@losangeles.af.mil,   Chief Engineer, Donald Sather Phone (310) 336-5649, Email donald.sather@aero.org

This Request For Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details/demonstrations based on their initial submittals.  Responses to this RFI are to be submitted and addressed to the Major Dale Winger at the above referenced email address, no later than 31 May 2006  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>58--Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar System, Increment III development effort for thirteen (13) test systems.
<SOLNBR>W15P7T-06-R-W008
<RESPDATE>072106
<ARCHDATE>09192006
<CONTACT>Joseph Manganaro, 732-427-1389
<DESC>The Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a lightweight, man-portable weapon location sensor system which, when properly sited, provides continuous 360-degree surveillance using an electronically scanned antenna.  The LCMR provides the ability t o automatically detect and locate mortar firing positions (MFP) up to a range of five (5) km by detecting the mortar round and backtracking to the MFP. Currently fielded Increment I and Increment II versions of the LCMR are providing counterfire support in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The LCMR Increment III system shall fulfill a current capability gap of existing c ounter fire radars and improve the capability of the previous LCMR systems.  It shall be a mortar, artillery, and rocket locating radar that is lightweight, physically small in size and electronic signature, with 360-degree search capability.  The LCMR sys tem will have increased accuracy and range, be highly mobile, interoperable, have built in reliability, and be a ruggedized battlefield radar system with high throughput.  The system shall be interoperable with Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System s (AFATDS), Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and future Command and Control (C2) systems, and have a day/night capability for supporting Warfighters in all operational environments including Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT).  The system shall b e modular in design, man-portable, and capable of being assembled, disassembled, and transported by a two soldier crew in virtually any position to support any operation.  The LCMR Increment III shall be designed to be High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled V ehicle (HMMWV) mountable as well as deployable in a stand alone, man-portable configuration.   The Government intends to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) in the 3QFY06 to the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil, for a cost reimbursement contract to acquire a twelve (12) month developmental effort to del iver up to thirteen (13) LCMR Increment III systems.  PM Radars, with the support of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), anticipates an additional three (3) month Increment III testing effort to validate the performance of those systems through de velopmental and operational testing.  At the conclusion of the Increment III test and evaluation phase, all exit criteria shall be satisfied.  The contract shall also include a Time and Materials (T&M) line item for contractor support during operational te st.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations shall be used. The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) established for Increment III include improved range and accuracy performance requirements, net-ready communications (interoperability), 360-degree coverage, and reliability.  The Government plans to incorporate requirements for associated efforts such as production acceptance qualification, evolution of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) and documentation (to include a Technical Data Package), initial spares, and training. The Government projects GFE contractor requests to include: one M1152 HMMPWV (with armor kits), Ultra Lightweight Camouflage Net Systems (ULCANS), Single Channel Ground to Air Radio Systems (SINCGARS), Tactical Communications (TAC) Links, Engineering Desig n Models (EDM), Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) gear and associated basic issue items (BII) which will be required for Increment III development and test.   The proposed source is Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC), 6225 Running Ridge Road, North Syracuse, NY 13212.  SRC is the designer and developer of the current LCMR Systems (Increments I and II) and is uniquely qualified to meet the Governments requireme nts.  The Government does not possess a Technical Data Package (TDP) for either of the two existing versions of the LCMR system as all radar versions were acquired under Research and Development contr acts with spiral developments continuing to increase the performance levels.  The design has not been stabilized due to outstanding engineering changes and a lack of any formal configuration management.  Due to this design instability, the Government has n ot procured a technical data package necessary to enable any other source to incorporate all outstanding engineering changes/upgrades and provide the Increment III version.   All responsible sources, that meet the above requirements, may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.    All interested contractors must possess a Secret facility clearance with Secret safeguarding capability.  Access to Secret and For Official Use Only (FOUO) information may occur during the course of this contract.  All interested contractors  should forwar d their in the clear address, Cage Code, point of contact with title and telephone number, and e-mail address to US Army C-E LCMC, C-E LCMC Acquisition Center, ATTN:  AMSEL-AC-CC-RT-W, Joseph Manganaro, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5008, email address: Joseph.M anganaro@us.army.mil to verify clearance See Numbered Note 22.

Background
FATE is an iterative research program that develops and evaluates an expanding array of ecological and oceanographic products intended for use in fishery stock assessment models. Most of these products have been derived from a “one species – one index” approach. While this approach has yielded fruitful results for a number of commercially important stocks, an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management requires an integrated ecosystem assessment. This proposal builds on the results of previously funded FATE projects, to move beyond correlative-based single-species indices and to address more realistically the complex interaction between environmental forcing and ecosystem variability. Our objective is to develop and validate a manageable set of leading ecological indicators that incorporate the complex physical-biological interactions driving variability in key populations that represent larger elements of the California Current ecosystem. We seek to do this with a team of oceanographers, fisheries biologists, seabird ecologists, and stock assessment scientists. We believe this approach will address the requirements of an ecosystem-based approach to management, and moves FATE into a new phase as a program that provides science-based information to decision-makers.
                   Deliverables
	Creation of life history matrices summarizing the relevant environmental influences and critical life history stages for eight species central to the CCS ecosystem (Figure 1; Year 1);
	Creation of a CCS ecosystem response matrix summarizing how representative critical ecosystem components respond to environmental forcing (Year 1);
	Development and dissemination of a set of physical (bottom-up) and biological (top-down) indices that represent broad impacts on the CCS ecosystem (Year 1);
       Development and validation of a set of leading ecological indicators for the CCS ecosystem (Year 2);
	Integration of the acquired information for implementation into stock-specific and ecosystem-based assessment models (Year 2).
 This project is part of the "Bottom-Up and Top-Down Indicators of Ecosystem Variability: An Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for the California Current System" which was funded by the FATE program (Fisheries and the Future) in response to a carefully constructed grant by a group of researchers that brought various areas of expertise to the project. One of the components is under the oversight of a UCSC Post Doc researcher. His involvement in this project is based on his unique experience and expertise in measuring and analyzing climatic effects on salmon aging and abundance. There are many partners from various institutions that collaborated on this proposal and it is critical they each participate and contribute their designated special skills for the successful completion of the project. The period of performance is July 2006 through May 2008. This notice may represent the only official notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen calendar (15) days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206)-526-6025 attention to Melvin Fondue.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
Enterprise Project Management (EPM) Tool 


1.0     BACKGROUND

The Department of the Treasury is the primary Federal agency responsible for the economic and financial prosperity of the United States.  The Treasury is organized into departmental offices and operating bureaus. The bureaus carry out specifically assigned mission operations. A primary mission operation is the corporate governance of financial institutions.

As a bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises national banks to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system that supports both the citizens and the economy of the United States.  The Comptroller is a presidential appointee with offices headquartered in Washington, DC.  The Comptroller also serves as a Director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

The problem associated with the existing business processes is that, currently, each Large Bank supervision team uses various spreadsheets to track its own planning of supervisory activities. There is no single application that can track all this data throughout all Large Banks. The idea of a new application was initiated to provide a consistent tool throughout Large Bank Supervision to aide supervisory activity planning, resource planning, and reporting efforts related to strategy execution at each Large Bank. The current OCC application suite does not provide the detailed level of planning and data collection tools necessary for Large Bank purposes, primarily in the area of activity planning. 

The OCC is seeking to determine if a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) enterprise project management (EPM) tool exists that can, with minimal customization, meet the requirements for this planning and reporting solution. 

2.0     PROJECT SCOPE

This project proposes creating a single point of access for data entry, retrieval and update by authorized users so that they will not have to repeat entering data in multiple systems or spreadsheets, and so that all Large Bank Examiners will share a common tool and interface for Resource Planning activities.  The scope of the project will provide the following capabilities.

·	Plan Supervision Examinations
·	Document specific Tasks and related Resource Assignment Requests
·	Provide an Activity and Resource Calendar
·	Review and Manage Strategies, Examinations and Tasks
·	Manage Authorization and Security
·	Provide Email and Calendar Notifications
·	Provide Reports
·	Miscellaneous Requirements
  


3.0     FUNCTIONALITY SUMMARY

In addition, the desired tool should meet the functionality outlined in the table below:
 

Functionality Summary	Detailed Explanation
Fully Web-based (no client software required other than Administration / Installation).	No product software required to be installed on the user workstation except to support offline usage.  Fully accessible using only a standard browser (e.g. Internet Explorer).
Provides examiners with the ability to work offline when necessary.	Supports the ability to export to and import from MS Project with no loss of information, or provides another mechanism for offline usage.
Supports multiple projects with activity hierarchy (work breakdown structure), resource loading, scheduling	Standard functionality similar to MS Project.  Supports multiple projects across the enterprise with detailed Work Breakdown Structures (WBS).  Supports resource loading of the WBS, and calculates the resulting schedule.
Customizable field names, customizable and extensible fields	Custom field names may be added to activities and other records to provide organizational specific terminology and to support sorting and reporting on activities.
Permissions capability meets granularity requirements	Capability to implement role-based security to restrict access to records or data fields based on a user role (Examiner, Team Lead, Resource Coordinator, EIC, etc.).
Robust reporting/dashboard capability; customizable reports	Customizable report generation and dashboard capability, providing easy tailoring of reports for OCC needs.

<DESC>Amendment-1: Please find the attached file containing an amendment to this solicitation. Question & Answers-1: Please find the attached file containing answers to questions presented by potential offerors for this solicitation. ORIGINAL ANNOUNCMENT: Title 49, United States Code, Chapter 443, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide insurance and issue or procure reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of American aircraft of foreign flag aircraft. Provision of such insurance is subject to several criteria. Such insurance must be necessary in the interest of air commerce or national security or to carry out the foreign policy of the United States. Further the insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from a commercial insurance company. The FAA is seeking proposals from interested parties to procure aviation insurance support services in the administration and settlement of insurance claims, the collection of information on commercial aviation insurance markets, evaluating program finances, and risk management and insurance brokerage services.  Provision of these services requires insurance industry contacts and agreements sufficient to form integrated claims adjustment and settlement teams to fit the unique circumstances of individual claims.  Further, knowledge is required of aviation insurance markets and insurer financing and risk mitigation techniques.  The service provider must understand the FAA aviation insurance program's statutory authority and responsibilities, and how these interface and impact program insurance coverage and claims settlements.  Finally, the insurance service contractor should not have current ongoing service contracts or relationships with air carriers, insurance companies, or other insurance service companies that would create a conflict of interest with the performance of tasks under this indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.

(1) 	Brace the new service enclosure to a minimum 50,000 amps, or a level greater than the bolted 3-phase short-circuit current available on the output terminals of the FLP transformer – whichever is greater. Obtain, and, submit, letter from FLP that identifies the bolted 3-phase short-current available at the FLP transformer output.      	
(2) 	800amp main breaker;
(3)	Main ground bus;
(4) 	Neutral conductor will be brought from vault into new service enclosure – and bonded to enclosure and to the main ground bus. 
(5)  	Neutral bus.    
(6) 	Install insulated 2/0 grounding electrode conductor from main ground bus to building grounding electrode system. Investigate the existing grounding electrode system in the switch-board room and make connections. If deficiencies in the grounding electrode system are perceived, bring these to the attention of the Government.      
(7) 	Branch breaker space to install a total of eight 200-amp, 3-pole, 480vac breakers. Branch breaker space must be on load side of main breaker.    	
(8) 	Install 200-amp, 3-pole, 480-vac breaker in the above mentioned space, to serve the following feeder run.     	

5.	From new service, install 3#3/0 and 1#6 G, in 2-inch EMT, to the following ATS.   

6.	Relocate minor electrical items on wall in switch-board room, to clear space for the following ATS. 	

7.	On wall, in switch-board room, install 200-amp, 3-pole, 480-vac, automatic transfer switch (ATS) – Cummins/Onan, or, equal. See specifications.    	 

8.	On wall in SWBD room, install 3-pole, 200-amp, enclosed, 480vac, circuit breaker.  

9.	From ATS, via CB, extend 3#3/0 and 1#6 G, in 2-inch EMT, vertically up through building, to 
5th floor electric closet – then, after the following demolition work, utilizing existing 2-inch conduit, extend 3#3/0 and 1#6 G, to new transformer to be located in 5th–floor office 532, Room 16A.     

10.	Demolition Work: Perform the following work in a phased manner that retains existing service to equipment – to the maximum extent feasible:  	
(1) 	Remove bus plug existing in 5th-floor electric closet – that serves 75KVA transformer in Office 532, Room 16A. Store bus plug as directed by the Government. 
(2) 	Remove wiring from existing conduit run that exists between 5th-floor electric closet and Office 532, Room 16A. Treat removed conductors as debris. 
 (3) 	In Office 532, Room 16A, remove existing 75KVA transformer, existing, nearby, enclosed, circuit breaker, and, the existing feeder to the adjacent 225-amp panel board.  
Panel-board will remain and be re-connected under another work item. Store the transformer in the building as directed by the Government. Treat other removed items as debris.  

11.	New Transformer: Install new 112.5KVA dry transformer in Room 16A – in place of removed 75-KVA transformer. Verify room dimensions, and room accessibility, prior to selecting transformer.  See specifications.  

12.	Door Modifications: For room ventilation, trim one-inch from the bottom of the door to 
Room 16A – finishing trimmed area to good décor.    

13. 	Exhaust Fan:  In partition area above door, install approximately 6-inch 120vac exhaust fan to pull air from Room 16A and exhaust in to the adjacent office. Obtain 120vac power from existing panel-board in Room 16A – utilizing a circuit dedicated to the fan. In fan circuit install a thermostat capable of being adjusted plus/minimum 10degrees around 80 degrees F – the exhaust fan to be activated at the set-point; the exhaust fan to be turned off @ approximately 10 degrees below the set point. Circuit de-activation to be by circuit breaker in the panel-board, only.         

14.	In Room 16A, tap transformer output terminals and extend 4#4, and 1#8G, in 1-inch EMT to the existing 225-amp panel-board in Room 16A.  Remove the existing main breaker from the existing 225-amp panel-bard and install a 3-pole 50-amp main circuit breaker. The existing panel-board is lightly loaded, with only about four circuits, and, the intent is to limit the load that this panel-board can place on the transformer.       

15.	The transformer is a separately-derived system – and shall be grounded per NEC 250.30.  From neutral stud of the transformer, install one, bare, 2/0, copper grounding electrode conductor, 
un-spliced, from Room 16A, to the 5th floor electrical closet, then, down the stack of closets, to the main switch-bard room, connecting this GEC conductor to the building grounding electrode system. This grounding electrode conductor must be un-spliced from the transformer on the 5th floor to the grounding electrode connection on the 1st floor. If deficiencies are perceived to exist in the building grounding-electrode-system, notify the Government.


16.	In Room 16A, in the transformer output feeder run, install one 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, enclosed, circuit-breaker, to protect the feeder conductors and protect the transformer. Lock this circuit breaker in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

17.	In computer room, install 3-pole, 400-amp, 480vac, safety switch – coordinating location with the Tenant Agency and Representatives of the Contracting Officer. Coordination is required here. Equipment exists in the computer room work areas - that must be removed in a phased manner. Lock this safety switch in the off position and deliver keys to GSA Personnel. 

18.	From near-by room on the 5th floor, transport an existing UPS by-pass switch in to the computer room and place in final location. This weight of this item is not deemed excessive and this item may be placed on the existing raised flooring.     

19.	Examine two additional pieces of existing UPS equipment, in a nearby 5th floor room, and, design and fabricate a steel support stand to support these two pieces of equipment in the computer room. Recent inspection time on site time did not permit a detailed examination or design for this support stand. Some time will be required on site determine the exact locations of equipment to be installed in the computer room and coordinate the design of an adequate support stand with the existing raised flooring that must be removed and determine base runner arrangements that can distribute the weight over a wide area. The Contractor can spend this time on site and investigate all site conditions – in coordination with GSA, and the Tenant Agency. 

  	The Contractor shall measure the two existing pieces of UPS equipment and prepare a sketch of a proposed steel stand to be placed on the concrete flooring in the computer room to support these two UPS items: one stand will be fabricated to support these two heavy UPS items. The stand will include the following features.           
(1) 	Distribute the weight of the two UPS items, evenly, along the concrete flooring under the existing raised flooring – over a foot-print much greater than the combined foot-print of the two UPS items.     
(2) 	Construct support system with angle iron with minimum dimensions of 5”x 5” x required lengths.  
(3) 	Provide two main base runs of angle iron that extended under the un-disturbed raised flooring at least four feet on two sides of the UPS equipment - beyond the foot print of the supported equipment. The total length of these two base runners will be the width of the footprint of the UPS equipment plus an additional eight feet – four feet on each side of the UPS equipment for and estimated total length of 12 feet. These two main base runners can be placed under the existing raised flooring, one at a time, then, the remainder of the support system set in place, on the runners, and bolted to the runners forming one rigid support system. This approach will distribute the weight over a wide area. Permanent removal of existing raised-flooring will occur in an amount slightly larger than the footprint of the two UPS equipment items. 
(4) 	The support system will contain a raised section that is a little larger than the foot-print of the two UPS items, and, will coordinate with the removal of raised floor tiles. The top of this raised support will be at the same elevation as the adjacent raised flooring. 
(5) 	The support system shall permit bottom conduit access into each of the UPS equipment items.
(7) 	Permit ventilation under the raised flooring to reach the UPS equipment. 
(8)	Prior to fabricating this support, prepare sketches and submit to the Government for review. Show in plan view the existing raised flooring that will be permanently removed.  Show the support system in its final position with the existing surrounding raised flooring abutting the support. Show elevation views viewing each side of the support system – viewed from beneath the raised flooring. Show a frontal elevation view of the UPS equipment in place resting upon the support system. GSA architects and structural engineers will review these sketches adequacy and décor. An Architect would be helpful in the preparation of these sketches. Record on the sketches the weight of each piece of equipment. Each weight is on the name-plate data of the equipment. 
(9)	Paint the entire metal support system with three coats of a, durable, black, enamel paint, selected to approximate the color of the UPS equipment.   	

(10)	After approval of a design for the support stand, portions of the stand should be fabricated off-site, then, brought into the computer room for final assembly. Final assembly must be accomplished using bolts. Welding will not be permitted. 

20.	Transport the two remaining pieces of UPS equipment, from a 5th floor office area into the computer room – placing on the support stand. The battery cabinet shall be transported with out batteries. Examine the conduit knock-outs to determine proper placement for the installation of interconnect conduits – coordinating with US Coast Guard Personnel to verify the orientation of these two cabinets. It is believed that that the battery cabinet should be placed to the left of the UPS cabinet – when viewed from the front. 

21.	Interconnect the battery cabinet and the UPS cabinet with liquid-tight flex conduit – sized to the knock-outs in the cabinets. 

22.	From transformer in Room 16A, via enclosed CB, extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and , and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the nearby computer room – traveling under the raised floor in the computer room, and rising into the following safety switch.  Extend neutral, un-spliced, through the disconnect switch, into the by-pass cabinet. The neutral is sized @ 173% of the phase-conductor capacity shown on the UPS name-plate data.    	      

23.	From safety switch in computer room extend 3#400 MCM phase conductors, 1# 700MCM neutral, and, and 1#3G in 4-inch GRS conduit, into the by-pass switch cabinet. Do not make connection in the by-pass cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor. 

24.	From by-pass switch cabinet, install two runs of 4-inch, liquid-tight flex conduit, to serve the UPS cabinet, with bottom feed. In each flex run, install 3#400 MCM phase conductors,  
1#700 MCM neutral, and 1#3 ground. [These are nominal sizes, based upon abbreviated APC literature. The Contractor shall consult with US Coast Guard Personnel and obtain a name and contact for APC – the Manufacturer of the UPS equipment and coordinate conductor sizes down stream of the by-pass switch cabinet with APC Technical Personnel- retaining name and telephone number of the APC Personnel providing the information. ]   Do not make connections in the by-pass cabinet or the UPS cabinet. These connections will be made by the UPS Vendor.     

25.	In computer room in location coordinated with GSA and the U. S. Coast Guard, install a new, 
225-amp, main-breaker, 42-pole panel-board, non-linear panel-board, with 225-amp main breaker.   
This panel will include a 200% neutral bus, isolated ground terminals and equipment ground terminals. 

26.	From UPS unit, to new 225-amp panel-board, install 3# 4/0 phase conductors, 1#500MCM neutral, 1#4G, in 3-inch LT flex conduit.   

27.	The UPS unit is considered a separately-derived system and must be grounded as such: the neutral must be grounded in the same manner as the neutral in the 112.5KVA transformer in Room 16A. 
	Either in the UPS unit or in the 225-amp panel-board, cadweld a bare #4 grounding-electrode-conductor to the 500MCM neutral and extend this bare GEC conductor into Room 16A, cadwelding the #4 GEC to the #2 GEC that serves the 112.5KVA transformer. The GEC is not required to be in conduit, but, must be protected. Route under raised floor, along walls, protecting with PVC conduit in congested areas.   

28.	One circuit at a time, and in coordination with the US Coast Guard, transfer about twenty existing branch circuits from an existing panel-board in the computer room – into the new UPS 
panel-board. Where the existing circuits are of in-sufficient length, replace the entire conduit and circuit run with new wire and LT flex conduit – of the proper size and phase arrangement.     
29.	One circuit at a time, and in coordination with the US Coast Guard, furnish and install approximately eight new branch circuits to serve computer equipment from the new 225-amp UPS  panel-board. 

30.	In coordination with the US Coast Guard, identify existing UPS and electrical equipment to be removed - after transition to new UPS system is complete. This equipment is understood to be the following:  
(1) 	25KVA transformer and associated conduit and wiring. Store transformer in building as directed. 
(2) 	Approximately 50KVA UPS system – including associated conduit and wiring. Store UPS equipment in building as directed. 

31.	In generator emergency distribution panel located in 3rd floor room adjacent to the existing 500KW generator, install 3P, 200-amp, 480vac circuit breaker.  	

32.	From 3rd-floor generator emergency distribution panel, extend one run of 3#3/0 & 1#6G, in 2-inch EMT down to the ATS in the main switchboard room on the 1st floor. Conduit will run out of panel-board room into the parking garage and travel down to the 1st floor. Floors must be cored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334511   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Technical Question & Answers  (Amendment #1) Question #1:   Regarding the camera system.  Is it acceptable to propose a digital stills camera?  If so, what signal will activate the camera?  Is a strobe required? Answer #1:   It is  acceptable to submit a quote with two options, one for a video camera and one for a digital still camera.  As for the activation of the camera, it preferred that it be triggered by an altimeter (or what is used to define height off the bottom, to a user defined altitude or distance from the bottom)  with a user determined frame rate.  As for the strobe, the strobe is required for the digital still camera, but not for the video. However, the video camera should have some type of lighting system. Question #2:  Regarding navigation, there is a middle of the road option utilizing a DVL that  provides excellent navigation accuracy vs. dead-reckoning, but without the cost of a full inertial navigation system. Is this acceptable to meet the EPA's specification for this requirement? Answer #2:   The middle of the road option is acceptable in relation to the EPA's specifications, but if  different options for navigation are available that meet the EPA's specifications and are quoted, that is also acceptable.       This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice.  The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00125.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  Shipping  charges need to be included in price.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 334511, and the small business size standard is 750 employees.  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are as follows:  Specifications: o	The AUV must be  easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components. o	All of  the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is required. o	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials  immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging from -1.6?C to 35?C and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10?C to 45?C.   o	A  connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated  with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation. o	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and updates from a computer.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data to the remote  computer. o	The AUV should have a secondary transponder (i.e., pinger locator device) in case of loss of AUV.				 o	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic positioning systems.	 o	When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning  algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for intermittent GPS updates. o	While the AUV is at the surface, geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential  GPS. o	The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components. o	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship. o	The AUV package  must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list  of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components. o	AUV demonstrations by candidate Contractors must be organized and conducted by the candidate Contractors, in coordination with the government representatives.  For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the  government representatives' meals, incidental expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be incurred by the candidate Contractors. o	Post-award AUV on-site services shall include training on all AUV hardware and  software systems. o	The operational performance and specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to U.S. EPA's AED scientists prior to acceptance of the AUV and associated payment in-full. o	Software must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation  Act. Specific Requirements: o	Length: 1.5-3 m o	Weight:   < 100 kg o	Depth rating:  > 100 m o	Sustained (mission) speed:  > 3 knots o	Endurance at mission speed: > 6 hours or 18 nautical miles o	Repower: via externally rechargable batteries (through externally accessible connector) and/or easy  (< 15 minute) battery swap procedure o	Navigation:  GPS and inertial navigation, without transponders o	Control Interface:  Vehicle is capable of total autonomy, and provides user-friendly ability to pre-determine vehicle path in 3D by lat/lons as well as by depth and altitude, including a  capability for oscillation patterns with depth/altitude.  Knowledge of specialized computer languages not required. o	Sensor suite and internally recorded parameters: Date, time, conductivity, temperature, depth, altitude, dissolved oxygen, latitude, longitude, heading, speed, battery voltage, and  scaled images (see camera requirements below)  o	Maximum equilibration time for all sensors, including dissolved oxygen:  0.3 seconds. o	Minimum data rate for internally recording the above parameters:  1.0 hertz (exception: camera, see below). o	Camera requirements: 480 line video camera at video  rate or (preferred) high-resolution (> 1.0 megapixel) still camera at 0.5 hertz or better.

<DESC>SOLICITATION S5105A-06-T-0011  SYNOPSIS

Amendment to the Solicitation
The purpose of this amendment is to reiterate the Evaluation Criteria for this effort.  

1. Technical factors consist of: 
a.	Plan of Action and Milestone Plan for meeting the requirements and needs within the expected period of performance
b.	Compatibility with DCMA computer systems
c.	A CD copy of the existing CBT on Eddy Current that will be modified
d.	Sample of video for quality assessment, approximately 5 minutes in length (videos may be provided in the Eddy Current CBT).
e.	Sample of the program that randomly selects database test questions and generates tests.
2. Past Performance
3. Price

Technical factors are of equal important and when combined are more important than Past Performance.  Past Performance is as important as Price.  

The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  In addition, proposed contract award will be based on a best value competitive source selection wherein the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance or reduced risk than in making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  However, if one or more Offerors are equal in technical performance, then price will become more important as a factor for award.  Therefore, in the event proposals are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price or cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.

In addition, the Government reserves the rights to establish a competitive range for evaluation purposes. The Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from price and technical standpoint.

The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) Headquarters requires technical and programming services for the development of additional modules for Non-destructive testing certification.  Statement of Work is attached to this solicitation.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
Enterprise Project Management (EPM) Tool 


1.0     BACKGROUND

The Department of the Treasury is the primary Federal agency responsible for the economic and financial prosperity of the United States.  The Treasury is organized into departmental offices and operating bureaus. The bureaus carry out specifically assigned mission operations. A primary mission operation is the corporate governance of financial institutions.

As a bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises national banks to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system that supports both the citizens and the economy of the United States.  The Comptroller is a presidential appointee with offices headquartered in Washington, DC.  The Comptroller also serves as a Director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

The problem associated with the existing business processes is that, currently, each Large Bank supervision team uses various spreadsheets to track its own planning of supervisory activities. There is no single application that can track all this data throughout all Large Banks. The idea of a new application was initiated to provide a consistent tool throughout Large Bank Supervision to aide supervisory activity planning, resource planning, and reporting efforts related to strategy execution at each Large Bank. The current OCC application suite does not provide the detailed level of planning and data collection tools necessary for Large Bank purposes, primarily in the area of activity planning. 

The OCC is seeking to determine if a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) enterprise project management (EPM) tool exists that can, with minimal customization, meet the requirements for this planning and reporting solution. 

2.0     PROJECT SCOPE

This project proposes creating a single point of access for data entry, retrieval and update by authorized users so that they will not have to repeat entering data in multiple systems or spreadsheets, and so that all Large Bank Examiners will share a common tool and interface for Resource Planning activities.  The scope of the project will provide the following capabilities.

·	Plan Supervision Examinations
·	Document specific Tasks and related Resource Assignment Requests
·	Provide an Activity and Resource Calendar
·	Review and Manage Strategies, Examinations and Tasks
·	Manage Authorization and Security
·	Provide Email and Calendar Notifications
·	Provide Reports
·	Miscellaneous Requirements
  


3.0     FUNCTIONALITY SUMMARY

In addition, the desired tool should meet the functionality outlined in the table below:
 

Functionality Summary	Detailed Explanation
Fully Web-based (no client software required other than Administration / Installation).	No product software required to be installed on the user workstation except to support offline usage.  Fully accessible using only a standard browser (e.g. Internet Explorer).
Provides examiners with the ability to work offline when necessary.	Supports the ability to export to and import from MS Project with no loss of information, or provides another mechanism for offline usage.
Supports multiple projects with activity hierarchy (work breakdown structure), resource loading, scheduling	Standard functionality similar to MS Project.  Supports multiple projects across the enterprise with detailed Work Breakdown Structures (WBS).  Supports resource loading of the WBS, and calculates the resulting schedule.
Customizable field names, customizable and extensible fields	Custom field names may be added to activities and other records to provide organizational specific terminology and to support sorting and reporting on activities.
Permissions capability meets granularity requirements	Capability to implement role-based security to restrict access to records or data fields based on a user role (Examiner, Team Lead, Resource Coordinator, EIC, etc.).
Robust reporting/dashboard capability; customizable reports	Customizable report generation and dashboard capability, providing easy tailoring of reports for OCC needs.

Part of this Working Group’s charter is to assess the Laser/Lidar capabilities currently available in the marketplace. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit general capability information from private industry, universities and other entities to assist with the roadmap development process, with the goal of ensuring that the best and widest possible set of capabilities is considered in the formulation of GSFC's plans for the future.   It is anticipated that the final roadmaps and the integrated architecture may ultimately contribute to NASA GSFC strategic investment decisions, but this RFI in no way constitutes a commitment of future funding opportunities from NASA.     Interested organizations are invited to submit to the NASA point of contact listed below a description of their Laser/Lidar technical and resource/facility capabilities relevant to space applications.	This submittal should also describe the organization’s experience and past performance in the areas of space-based lidar systems and FSLC.  Capability Statements should include an executive summary, not to exceed two pages, to address any major initiatives or other items that the organization wishes to highlight.   As part of its assessment of industry capabilities, the GSFC LWG may contact respondents to this RFI if clarification or further information is needed, however, the Government is under no obligation to have discussions with any or all respondents.   Capability Statements shall be submitted to the point of contact listed below and must be received by close of business Friday, June 2, 2006.  Statements may be submitted electronically via email, by fax, or by regular mail, to the addresses listed below.

<SUBJECT>R -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION on LIQUIDATION OF ASSETS OR PERFERRED LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS IN SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES WITHIN THE CURRENT OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit input from interested parties on ways in which SBA can liquidate the assets or Preferred Limited Partnership interests of Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) in the Office of Liquidation within the current legal and operational framework.  The goal of this RFI is to solicit information on marketing and selling these assets to interested secondary market buyers at reasonable fair market prices.

BACKGROUND:

The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program was created to stimulate and supplement the flow of private equity capital and long term loans to Small Business Companies (SBCs). 

SBICs are privately owned and managed investment funds, licensed and regulated by SBA, that use their own capital plus funds from SBA (“leverage”), in the form of SBA-guaranteed debentures or participating securities (“SBA-guaranteed leverage”)  to make investments in eligible small businesses.  (Attachment describes the different types of SBA-guaranteed leverage.)  SBIC’s may invest only in qualifying small business concerns as defined by SBA regulations.  Detailed regulations for SBICs are found at www.sba.gov/library/lawroom.html#Part107.

SBICs are monitored by the Investment Division’s Office of SBIC Operations.  SBA has the right to transfer to the Office of Liquidation those SBICs that fail to comply with the statutory or regulatory requirements for the SBIC program, including capital impairment (a regulatory measure that the SBA uses to assess an SBIC’s ability to repay its leverage), and in those cases, SBA can repurchase the SBA-guaranteed leverage issued by the SBIC (“repurchased leverage”).  The Office of Liquidation is responsible for overseeing the liquidation of these SBICs until the SBIC either repays all leverage or all assets have been sold or written off, at which time they are categorized as “closed”.  For the purposes of this document, an SBIC is considered “transferred” if the SBIC has been assigned to the Office of Liquidation and has not been closed by that office.

As of March 31, 2006, the Investment Division had 124 transferred SBICs, with outstanding leverage exceeding $1.7 billion.  The transferred SBICs had almost 1800 underlying assets (both debt and equity securities) in connection with over 800 small business concerns .  The original costs of these assets exceed $1 billion.  SBICs that issued participating securities (“PS SBICs”) comprise the majority of the transferred SBICs, with over $1.5 billion in outstanding repurchased leverage.  PS SBICs typically have more equity investments, with 94% by cost of the transferred PS SBICs assets in equity securities.  Transferred Debenture SBICs, in contrast, only hold 44% by cost in equity securities.

It is anticipated that the number of transfers will continue to grow in the next few years, especially for PS SBICs.  It is critical for the Investment Division to ensure that it has the capabilities and processes in place to be able to liquidate current and future transferred SBIC assets.  The key objective is to maximize recoveries for the Federal government, while maximizing recoveries and minimizing the time required to liquidate these assets at reasonable fair market prices.


GENERAL MODELS:

There are two general models for liquidating funds in the Office of Liquidation.  The first is the Receivership model.  Under this approach, the SBA seeks a court order to place the SBIC in Receivership.  When the order is granted, a Receiver is appointed to manage the SBIC for the benefit of the creditors and limited partners and the former managers are dismissed.  Frequently, the SBA serves as the Receiver and appoints an independent contractor as agent to manage the day-to-day affairs of the SBIC and explore liquidation options.  Under this option, the Receiver has the flexibility to sell the SBIC’s interest in specific assets, subject to transfer restrictions, or to sell the SBA’s Preferred Limited Partnership Interest, subject to the SBA’s approval.

The second model is the Self-Liquidation/Wind-Down model.  Under this approach the SBIC in Liquidation has presented an acceptable liquidation plan, which among other things, includes repayment of the SBA’s leverage in a reasonable timeframe.  The SBIC’s managers remain in control of the SBIC under the close overview of the Office of Liquidation.  Under this model, the SBA would consider opportunities to market its Preferred Limited Partnership interest or assist the SBIC in marketing the SBIC’s interest in portfolio assets, subject to transfer restrictions.

Both models are permitted under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
		
	SBA’s Preferred Interest
Participating Securities are redeemable hybrid securities that are issued in the form of a preferred limited partnership interest, with SBA as the preferred limited partner.  SBA’s Preferred Limited Partnership interest is not a typical LP interest, particularly with regard to its distribution rights.  As a Preferred Limited Partner, the SBA is entitled to receive a preferred return (referred to as the “Prioritized Payment”) prior to any profit distributions being made to the General and private Limited Partners, but this return is payable by the SBIC to SBA only from profits.  In a typical limited partnership distribution, principal would be returned before profits. However, the PS distribution scheme requires for profit to be distributed before a return of principal except when the SBIC is in liquidation or restricted operations status (discussed below).  In addition, the PS instrument also provides SBA with profit participation typically in the range of 6 to 12%.  This structure also differs from that of a traditional fund in that the SBA’s share of profits is substantially lower than its pro-rata share of capital contributed.  In exchange for the substantially lower portion of the SBIC’s profits, the SBA receives a preference in liquidation.  When an SBIC is placed in a restricted or liquidation status, the distribution hierarchy changes to provide for priority of payment to SBA.

            The Preferred Limited Partnership interest also differs from typical LP rights in that it lacks certain control provisions that are typical in other LP interests such as voting rights, the ability to curtail management costs, remove the GP, suspend new investments, and/or require liquidation of the portfolio/fund.    SBA's protective rights come primarily from regulatory powers set forth in the Small Business Investment Act and in SBA’s Regulations:  Section 107 of Title 13 (Business Credit and Assistance) of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

SBA’s regulatory rights, however, are not transferable to a buyer of SBA’s Preferred Limited Partnership interest.  As a result the buyer of SBA’s Preferred Limited Partnership interest would obtain the distribution rights but not the other rights present in a typical LP interest.  

	SBIC Assets
The individual sale of SBIC assets in liquidation status is challenged by the lack of consistency in deal documents (each transaction is unique) and the frequent existence of negative covenants. 

AREAS OF COMMENTS: 

Specifically, the Agency seeks comments on improving the implementation and liquidation timeframe for both of the models described above: Receivership and Self-Liquidation/Wind-Down.

The response should specifically address the following needs of the Federal government:

1.	Sale of Preferred Limited Partnership Interest:  What would be the market for selling the SBA’s Preferred Limited Partnership interest in Participating Securities SBICs?  What key elements are considered when assessing potential purchases  (i.e. pricing, terms, transfer provisions, etc.)?  What factors could increase the marketability of the SBA’s Preferred  LP interest?

2.	Sale of SBIC Assets:  In receivership, there is more flexibility to market the SBIC’s ownership position in specific portfolio assets.  In this scenario, what types of assets would be most attractive to secondary funds?  What type of information would be needed to make a decision on the assets?  What is the best manner to make potential parties aware of the “available” Receivership assets? 

3.	Timeline:  What would be the typical timeline for the sale of (i) SBA’s Preferred LP interest and (ii) a Receivership asset?

4.	Legal/Structural Issues:  What legal and/or structural issues would you see as  a barrier to selling either SBA’s LP interest or Receivership assets?

5.	Best Value:  How can SBA ensure that it is realizing the best value for the assets it sells?

DATES and ADDRESSES:

Responses should be submitted to SBA, Office of SBIC Liquidation on or before 5:00 pm EST on May 26, 2006.  Electronic Responses are preferred and should be addressed to RFIResponse@SBA.GOV.  Include SBIC Liq RFI Responses in the subject line.  SBA is not accepting questions in any format.

<DESC>The US Army is seeking sources for a Programmable Encryption Device (PED). The PED is used to provide over the air traffic encryption functionality for Force Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Blue Force Tracking (BFT) Satellite Network multica st and unicast Situational Awareness and Command and Control messaging from multiple locations, and device health monitoring messages to and from the Satellite Communications transceiver.  The PED is required to process messages up to secret and is install ed in Army and US Marine Corps tactical ground vehicle platforms, rotary wing aircraft and at the FBCB2 BFT Global Network Operations Centers.  This device must operate in, and meet the environmental conditions of these ground and air platforms, to include  the platform unique shock and vibration profiles. Additionally, it must be operational in temperatures ranging from -40 C to +85 C, must be Nuclear, Biological and Chemical compliant and must interface with the existing installation kit cabling.   The Government does not own the design rights to the PED and cannot provide detailed drawings sufficient to reproduce the device.  A draft of the Interface Control Document will be provided upon request by e-mailing the PM technical POC Stanley.Wnuck@us.ar my.mil  or phone number 732-427-6892. The PED consists of a ruggedized aluminum cast rectangular box, approximately 4 x 7 x  2 with four external military grade connectors  a standard 6-pin Communications Security fill connector, a red interface connec tor, a black interface connector, and a 28 volt DC power supply connector.  Both the red and black interface connectors of the PED are programmable and support either an RS232/422 serial interface or a 10/100 Ethernet electrical interface.  The red and bla ck interfaces to the PED employ a custom messaging protocol that was developed by Comtech Mobile Datacom Corporation, Germantown, MD, for its MT2011E L-band Transceiver.

This project will replace the existing 1959 vintage 15 kV three phase switching station #1 with modern 15 kV switchgear in a protective enclosure.  The new switching station switchgear lineup will consist of three circuit breakers for circuits B, C, and D with one spare circuit breaker and one spare space for future growth.  The enclosure will protect the equipment from exposure to the salt water/air and protect maintenance personnel when performing circuit breaker maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  The new 15 kV circuit breakers will have microprocessor controlled protective relaying functions to properly coordinate the power distribution system at this location.  There will be a SCADA-type control system provided to control the functions of the circuit breakers and protective relaying for this switching station.  The control station will be located at the control room of Building 160.  There will be pole line work associated with installation of the new switching station to re-connect the existing circuits fed from the switchgear and to allow circuits to be bypassed during switchgear maintenance procedures.

<SUBJECT>--Temperature and Humidity Chamber with options of window, light, door port, wire shelf cable notch, low humidity capability, IEEE-488 Bus Interface, water purification and Recirculation and Training.
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army, REDCOM, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the United States Army  Soldier System Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to  Thermotron I ndustries, 291 Kollen Park Drive, Holland Michigan 49423.   This is for the purchase of an Temperature and Humidity Chamber with options.   Only the Thermotron model SM-8-3800 Temperature/Humidity Chamber provides heat exhaust through the top of the unit a nd fits within the space constraints of the lab, particularly the 50 inch depth requirement.  The chamber must fit flush to walls on its right and back sides.  Units from other manufacturers, which have rear exhaust, require an extra 1.5-3 feet of clearanc e behind the unit for exhaust air passage.  With this type of arrangement the unit would sit too far out from the wall and would prevent access to other parts of the lab.  This would also create a critical safety issue in the event of an emergency by block ing passage through the lab.  The Thermotron unit can sit flush against the walls and still allow access and full mobility to other parts of the lab.    Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Greg Wilson (AMSRD-ACC-NS) or by gregory.wilson@natick.army.mil.  This synopsis expires May 25, 2006 at 12:00 pm local time.

All key changes and imperatives that can be anticipated – the creation of the Coordinating Center and resulting changes to DHAP’s structure and business practices – have already taken place.

12.  Does the CDC have its own internal leadership development process, or are they desirous of the external contractor developing one based upon the information gleaned from this project?  

DHAP has its own internal leadership development process, but is looking to augment it based on the governance plan and any issues identified during the process.

13. In Phase II, what opportunities will exist for recommendations and implementation planning to be validated down the line from top and mid-management?

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Statement of Work:

Title of Project:  Prospective Evaluation of Immunologic and Immunogenetic Susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and progression to disease

C.1  Background and Need – 

In 1998, CDC initiated an immunologic contact study in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).  Until 2002, CWRU’s collaboration with CDC was at no cost to CDC.  Beginning in 2002, CDC has funded CWRU through a sole source mechanism to continue to perform the immunologic assays required for this project.  Developing and performing immunologic assays is a specialized skill.  The sensitivity and specificity of immunologic assays for the same parameter vary from laboratory to laboratory.  To maintain comparability of results, it is important that all samples be tested in a single laboratory.  Since the immunologic testing for this study began at CWRU, it is essential to the scientific quality of the results that the remainder of the immunologic assays for the study also be performed in the same laboratory.  CWRU has already tested 2,027 of the 3,000 samples which will be collected for this project.  

C.2  Project Objective – 

To identify cytokine surrogate markers for protective immunity to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis among contacts exposed to infectious tuberculosis patients.  Results of this work serve as a critical step in the process of developing and testing new candidate vaccines for tuberculosis. 

C.3  Scope of Work – 

CWRU will perform cytokine assays for interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin 10 on 973 whole blood specimens (through specimen number 3000), as well as Elispot measurements for Interferon-gamma on a subset of 200 consecutive whole blood specimens.  Results of these assays will be reported back to CDC on a quarterly basis.  


C.4  Technical Requirements – 

1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be separated from whole blood according to standard techniques, and cytokine assays will be set up the same day specimens are received.


2. DNA will be extracted from whole venous blood using the Puregene DNA isolation kit from Gentra Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to standard techniques, and stored at -700C until immunogenetic testing is performed.  

3. To assess MTB antigen-induced production of cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IL-10) and beta chemokines (MIP1-alpha)  previously shown to be involved in antituberculous immunity, a whole blood cell culture method will be used.  This method has been applied previously in a field study evaluating immune responses in leprosy patients (Weir et al), and has been modified by investigators of TBRU to assess antituberculous immunity in individuals enrolled in a household contact study (designed to study immunological correlates of transmission of MTB infection) in Kampala, Uganda.  In parallel, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be separated from the remaining heparinized blood according to standard techniques and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen freezers for later use in assays evaluating frequencies of M. tuberculosis antigen-stimulated IFN-gamma-producing T cells (ELIspot technique).  Elispot assays will be performed in batches and utilizing freeze-thawed PBMC. 

4. Anti-coagulated whole blood will be diluted (10-fold) in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium containing Hepes (15 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM) and Penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (5 micrograms/ml). r Eight 1ml aliquots of the diluted whole blood from each study subject are dispensed into 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon), and plates containing diluted whole blood (2 wells each additive [stimulus]-free, with culture filtrate of MTB [5 mg/ml]  are incubated at 370C, 5% CO2 for up to 5 days. Whole blood culture supernatants from the first four two wells are collected following 24hs of culture; the content of the remaining four wells is recovered following 5 days of incubation. Once collected, whole blood culture supernatants are stored frozen at - 700 C until assessment of cytokine and chemokine immunoreactivities (TNF-alpha in 24h supernatants; IFN-gamma and IL-10 immunoreactivities in 5 day samples).

5. For assessment of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma immunoreactivities in whole blood culture supernatants commercially available "cytokine (ELISA) kits" are used. Levels of TNF-alpha, MIP1-alpha, and TGF-beta are measured with assay systems available from R&D Diagnostics with a lower detection limit of < 7 pg/ml of cytokine immunoreactivity (TNF-alpha, MIP1-alpha, and TGF-beta). PIERCE/ENDOGEN is the source of the ELISA kit evaluating IFN-gamma immunoreactivity in whole blood culture supernatants.  In this assay levels of IFN-gamma > 2 pg/ml are significant.  IL-10 immunoreactivity is assessed utilizing a kit from BioSource.  This ELISA has a lower limit of detection of < 2 pg/ml of IL-10.

6. For ELIspot assays, viable cells will be cryopreserved. To freeze cells, freezing media (FCS containing 10% DMSO) will be prepared and chilled either by placing it on ice or placing it at - 200C for about 30 minutes.  Prior to freezing, cells are washed in RPMI.  The supernatant is decanted, the cell pellet is vortexed and freezing media then is added bit by bit while constantly swirling the tube.  To assess frequencies of MTB antigen-stimulated, IFN-gamma-producing cells, the Elispot technique will be used.  This assay (described in detail in Hirsch et al JID 2001) is in routine use in Dr. Hirsch’s laboratories in Cleveland.  Elispot microtiter plates (Athersys) are first coated by adding 100 ul/well of a monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma (PIERCE/ENDOGEN, 4 ug/ml) diluted in PBS, and incubating the plates overnight at 40C.  On the next morning PBMC are added and plates are incubated at 370C overnight.  Following two additional incubations with capping antibody and streptavidin peroxidase on the next morning, plates are developed using AEC substrate.  Numbers of spots in each well, which correspond to frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing cells, will be assessed using the ELIspot reader (CTL) in the CFAR Cytokine Core Facility at CWRU.  Frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing cells will be correlated with cytokine content in whole blood supernatants and contact TST and disease status.  


C.5  Reporting Schedule – 

Cytokine assay and Elispot results will be entered into an excel spreadsheet and sent electronically to CDC on a quarterly basis.  The preliminary results of all assays will be sent to the CDC no later than one year from the date of award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, a simplified acquisition under FAR part 13 and a total small business set-aside. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) is investigating in vitro characterization of Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) as a component in the demonstration of their bioequivalence. A set of in vitro tests would be used as part of the determination of product equivalence. These include the emitted dose evaluated at different flow rates and the particle size (measured by cascade impactor) produced at different flow rates for development of a product with potentially different ratios of carrier to drug from those found in the reference product. The purpose is to evaluate the proposed in vitro equivalence tests for DPIs to identify the sensitivity to differences in product formulations; evaluate the variability to be expected in the in vitro tests; and investigate the extent to which the device can be changed to counteract differences in formulation and provide equivalent in vitro performance. In this project, products with known differences (which should include ratios of drug substance (DS) to carrier, particle size (carrier or DS), surface roughness, and different manufacturing steps) would be manufactured and then tested at multiple flow rates for emitted dose and for particle size by cascade impactor. Monthly progress reports will be required. At the completion of the project, a report analyzing the results of the study shall be provided to the FDA. In addition, all of the raw data from the experiments shall be provided to the FDA. Offerors shall submit technical proposals to demonstrate their ability to perform the work. Offerors shall propose 1 or 2 model drugs to be studied and shall justify these selections for generalizability. Technical merit will be assessed on the following factors: 50% Qualification of the PI as assessed by education, publications, and previous research projects relevant to the project; 25% Quality of the facilities required including laboratory space and analytical instrumentation; and 25% Quality of the proposal as assessed by its ability to meet the requirements set forth above. A separate pricing proposal must be submitted itemizing projected costs required to complete the work. Cost realism will be analyzed to determine the offeror’s understanding of the requirement as well as to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. A firm fixed price award is anticipated, with a monthly payment schedule corresponding to the offeror’s anticipated monthly costs or cash flow or corresponding to progress achieved, except that not less than 5 percent of the negotiated price shall be withheld pending acceptance of the final report and all raw data. Payment of monthly invoices will depend on acceptance by the Project Officer of the monthly progress report. This is a best buy acquisition in which technical factors are significantly more important than all other factors including price and past performance. Award will be made using SF1447 as a bilateral purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; all relevant required clauses will apply.

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of up to 90 new pickup trucks to replace old equipment and to allow for an expansion of  NAS support to counternarcotics operations in Bolivia. The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations. The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm. They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops. The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.


The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer’s warranties. Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia’s extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain. The supplied vehicles are to be “new,” which is defined as “having zero miles.” Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.  Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government. The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation  and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMNL) requires services to catalog aerial photographs of bowhead whales according to image quality and whale ID using standardized protocol, search for resighting of individual whales among the images, and conduct analysis as requested in establishing biological parameters of resighted whales.

A study plan developed at the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission in June 2004 was initiated to investigate the stock (or multiple stocks) of bowhead whales in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas around Alaska.  Concern has been expressed that there might be two stocks, but management procedures – in particular the annual quota – is based on a single stock model.  An integral part of the study plan is to examine available photographs of bowhead whales taken during aerial surveys.  There are currently 3144 prints at NMML representing over 2,300 whales.  In addition, NMML has recently received 1150 photographs from a survey done in 2003, 1443 from 2004, and 851 from 2005.  At LGL, ltd. in Ontario, Canada, there is a photographic collection of similar size, most of which overlaps with the NMML collection.  However, the collections are not uniform as to whether the images are in prints, color transparencies, medium format, or large format.  One objective would be to have these images scanned into a database such that they can be easily shared between facilities.  Many but not all images have been categorized as to photo quality and the amount of marks there are on each whale.  This process of categorizing photographs and images needs to continue until all of the collection is complete.  Images can then be studied for resighted whales, that is, the marks on a whale’s back are often unique enough that a whale can be reidentified in subsequent years.  Reidentifications need to be made first within a given year and then between years.  Subsequently the database needs to be updated with all of the new images and respective information. 
	The goals of the eventual analyses are to: 1) derive an abundance estimate using mark-recapture techniques comparing photographs from 2003 to those from 2004; 2) estimate survivorship; 3) determine calving rates; 4) study growth rates of re-identified individuals; 5) further document the migratory timing of individual whales; and 6) compare rates of reidentifications near Barrow, Alaska, in the spring relative to other areas, such as around St Lawrence Island as a part of the stock structure study.
	Duties inherent in this project are a careful examination and processing of many photographs, good records of work accomplished, and a keen eye to fine detail in photo quality and whale markings.  Results from this study may play an important role in better managing this endangered species at the international level. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 526-6025 annention to Melvin Fondue. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation and resultant award.

If the answer is yes, the contractor shall ask if the patient, or the patient’s sponsor, is on flying status.  The contractor shall ask the medical reason (symptom) for the call.  All patient medical symptoms shall be provided to the on-call provider.  For all symptom-based calls, the contractor shall document the patient’s or sponsor’s flying status or non-flying status, name, age, social security number, chief symptom(s), and a phone number where the patient can be reached.  For anything other than medical symptoms, such as medical prescription refill requests or appointment requests, the contractor shall advise the caller to call the MDG’s appointment and information line, during normal duty hours of 7:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m., at 228-2778.

1.1.2.3.  The contractor shall route calls to the Primary Care on-call provider, the Flight Medicine on-call provider, or the Pediatric on-call provider.  If the Pediatric provider is on-call, the contractor shall contact the Pediatric provider for all patients age 14 and younger.

1.1.5.  Location of Services.  Services shall be provided at the contractor’s place of business.

1.1.6.  Records Documentation.  The contractor shall keep a written record of all calls, and shall provide the records to the 355 MDG/SGHG (Senior Group Practice Manager) on a monthly basis.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - 
1.	Is there an incumbent, who is it, and what is the current price of the contract?  No previous contract in place.  
2.	How many call center agents are currently used to take the calls?  N/A
3.	What is the average length of each call, both incoming patient calls and outgoing calls?  The time of the call to the call center is short—a name and phone # is collected and other information (as specified in the Performance Work Statement), and then the provider is paged.
4.	Is there a breakdown of the daily call activity? Something that would show the peak times of the day?  This is not available
5.	Is there an industry standard that will be used to rate the contractor on call performance? Like 80% answered within 30 seconds (80/30)?  None known.  
6.	Is there a Service Level Agreement standard for the incoming phone calls and outgoing calls...e.g. incoming answered within 30 seconds with 5% abandoned?  If the patient can’t get through, they have to call back later if it is important.  Call volume is not great enough for a queue to be an issue.
7.	How does the contractor, the contractor POC and the call staff interact with QAP, and what feedback does each get in regards to call performance?  No current contract in place; no interation.
8.	Is there a breakdown of weekend and holiday call statistics? How many calls are received on the weekend hours?  Not available
9.	Do you have a breakdown of calls for daytime shift and after hour's shifts?  Not available
10.	Is there a database application that the contractor will have access to verify or enter the patient information?  Any MS word or excel application could be used to track incoming patient calls.  We don’t need the patient’s information verified, just recorded.  Even paper will suffice.
11.	In 1.1.4, how much time lapses between the first pager call until the contractor attempts to call the on-call providers cell phone? And how much time until the contractor attempts to contact the POC?  Ten minutes for the first pager call and then call the cell phone.  Wait another twenty minutes and if nobody calls back, call the POC.  30 minutes total.
12.	In 3.1. Procedural Guidance it states, “The contractor shall perform services compatible with the medical facility’s operating capacity and equipment.     The contractor shall not introduce new services without prior recommendation to, and approval of, the medical treatment facility (MTF) Commander or authorized representative.”  Can you please define what ‘services’ are and what the current medical facility state is regarding operating capacity and equipment?  Just delete this information.  They just need to have working phones and a system to place callers on hold with music or a local radio station in the background.
13.	In 2.1, referring to the contacts that are on call...  How will the name and number list be transmitted to the contractor?  This will be provided periodically by fax to the contractor as the on-call list becomes available.  The call is typically organized weeks in advance—not last minute.
14.	In 3.2, regarding on-line HIPPA training does this cost anything and if so does the government paying for it? How long of a training session is it?  This on-line training is free and takes 30-60 minutes to complete.  
15.	Please explain 1.1.8 is this not for after hours service.  There will be times when military personnel will be unable to maintain the call center and the MDG will have to close the center and ask the contractor to provide answering service.

Deficiencies or required repairs discovered during preventive maintenance procedures, but not a part of such preventive maintenance procedures, will be brought to the attention of the Store Director or his/her representative.  Repairs, if authorized, will be considered unscheduled services and billed as such as defined in the following section.  In addition, scheduled preventive maintenance procedures shall not be used to make repairs at any time due to damage by fire, water, burglary, accident, abuse, and acts of God.  Such repairs shall also be considered to be an unscheduled service.  

Unless otherwise specified in the schedule, the frequency of scheduled Preventive Maintenance is as follows:  

d)	Quarterly:  Scheduled Preventive Maintenance shall be performed once (1) per quarter (quarter is identified in the schedule) on the following:  automatic entrance/exit, impact, bumper, and overhead doors.   

e)	The initial quarterly scheduled service shall be performed not more than twenty (20) days after contract award and thereafter not less than 70 days, nor more than 100 days, from the previous quarterly service.

11.          UNSCHEDULED SERVICE CALLS AND REPAIR PARTS:  Service calls shall be made as deemed necessary by the Store Director or designated representative to repair or maintain the listed doors in normal operating condition.  Repairs beyond the normal scheduled preventive maintenance scope (i.e., replacement of a motor) shall be considered unscheduled repairs, and the labor and parts associated with the repairs shall be charged against the unscheduled service calls and repair parts line item.  

Contractor shall respond to routine service calls within eight (8) working hours after receiving notification by the Store Director or designated representative and shall perform necessary service on doors within 24 hours.  Such service shall be furnished during the contractor’s normal duty hours.

Contractor shall respond to emergency service calls within two (2) hours and perform repairs within four (4) hours of receiving emergency calls.  An emergency service call is defined as a door or dock leveler failure which would interrupt critical commissary operations and in which no backup equipment is available at the commissary.  The Store Director or designated representative may request that the contractor provide service during other than normal duty hours (to include weekends and holidays) based on an assessment of the situation and its impact on the commissary operation and shall pay the appropriate overtime rate for the service as approved by this contract.

The Store Director or designated representative will advise the contractor whether the service call is “routine” or an “emergency” (as defined immediately above) at the time of placing the service call.

Prior to commencing work, the contractor will provide the Store Director or designated representative with a written estimated cost of the work required and will proceed only upon approval of the Store Director or designated representative.  The contractor will immediately notify Store Director or designated representative if actual repair cost exceeds the initial estimate.

It is both the responsibility of the contractor and the commissary to notify the contracting office prior to performing any services which (if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued) will exceed 80% of the applicable “Not to Exceed” (NTE) subclin amounts.  

The Government shall not be obligated to pay the contractor any amount in excess of the NTE ceiling price in the schedule, unless and until the contracting officer shall have notified the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and shall have specified in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract.

12.	REPLACEMENT/REPAIR PARTS:  All costs associated with scheduled preventive maintenance shall be included in PM costs.  However, all costs discovered during scheduled preventive maintenance but not regarded as scheduled preventive maintenance may be reimbursed under the unscheduled parts and labor line items.  All costs for parts, which result in less than $5.00 per “total quantity”, shall be included in the labor rate charge for unscheduled maintenance and service calls.  Parts less than $5.00 total quantity shall not be charged or reimbursed separately.  For this purpose, “total quantity” shall refer to the aggregate quantity for same group of similar items.  For example:

5 nuts and 5 bolts at $0.05 each are considered a total quantity of 10.  Total quantity 10 nuts/bolts x $0.05 = $0.50 which shall not be charged or reimbursed separately.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.   Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.   To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).   Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is amendment number 0002. 

Reference combined synopsis/solicitation paragraphs entitled Description and Solicitation Information: The closing date for receipt of proposals is extended from May 22, 20006 to May 31, 2006.
 

Section A.2 Requirements – Change to read as follows:
This acquisition is for a replacement radar altimeter system which meets the following minimum requirements: Honeywell International, Model HG9550 LPI Radar Altimeter, model No.HG9550AD01 or equal with the following salient characteristics:
a) Unit must be an off the shelf, current production model, commercial item of modern low power design, high accuracy, qualified for use in US military aircraft. This requirement is driven by the extreme turbulence encountered by the NOAA/AOC WP-3 aircraft during a number of mission profiles, including Hurricane research.
b) Unit must be completely compatible and interface to a current production radar height indicator capable of displaying altitude from 0 ft up to 50,000 ft.  NOAA/AOC has an existing inventory of at least 7 high altitude radar height indicators, Moog model 85000000-02.     
c) Unit must be plug and play compatible with the existing NOAA/AOC APN-232 radar altimeter receiver transmitter. Due to the high cost of aircraft modification, only units which are compatible with the existing radar altimeter wiring and mounts will be considered.
d) Unit must be a modern low power radar altimeter, with a peak transmit power not to exceed 1 watt. This requirement is needed because the NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive research equipment onboard, the operation of which may be degraded by an unnecessarily strong signal transmitted by the radar altimeter.
e) The unit shall operate in a frequency band allocated by the FCC for aeronautical radio navigation. Minimum transmit frequency shall be 4.2 GHz.  NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive equipment on board, and the higher the radar altimeter transmit frequency, the less likely there will be conflicts with research instrumentation.
f) The unit shall operate with a minimum band width, not to exceed 200MHZ.     NOAA/AOC aircraft operate with a wide variety of sensitive equipment on board, and the narrower the radar altimeter bandwidth, the less likely there will be conflicts with research instrumentation.
g) Defects in the digital data altitude output from the unit shall be minimal, with no processing algorithm changes which result in a step increase or decrease in reported altitude throughout the operating range of the unit.
 

Section B. Evaluation - Change to read as follows:
The evaluation of proposals shall be based on the Offeror's technical capability, i.e. ability to provide the items specified in accordance with the requirements listed in Section A, past performance, and Offeror's price proposal.  If determined to be advantageous, the Government may consider proposed units which do not fully meet all of the requirements if the Offeror clearly identifies the deficiency and the related operational impact. 


Additionally, at the Government’s discretion, the Offeror shall furnish to the Government a demonstration unit of the product offered for flight evaluation.  The Government will test and evaluate the demonstration unit to determine compliance with all the characteristics listed in the solicitation and other requirements for technical acceptability. If required, the evaluation flight profile and test criteria will be issued to the Offerors following initial evaluation of proposals.  Desired time period for the flight testing is within 45 days of notice of intent to perform flight testing.  The demonstration unit shall be available for a period of  2-weeks.  The Offeror shall include in their proposal the availability of the demonstration unit to the Government for the 2-week flight evaluation.
