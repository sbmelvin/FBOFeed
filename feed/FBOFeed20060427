<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition from qualified organizations to award a multi-year contract to conduct the next phase of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).  HCUP is a family of health care databases and related software tools and products developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by AHRQ.  HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national information resource of patient-level health care data.  Currently, there are 38 States with data organizations that participate as HCUP Partners by sharing their inpatient and outpatient data with AHRQ.  HCUP involves many activities, a subset of these are achieved through a contract mechanism.  The HCUP family of health services databases includes:  HCUP State databases – state-specific annual inpatient and outpatient discharge and visit level data files; HCUP nationwide databases – nationwide samples derived from the HCUP State databases enabling focused research on special populations; and other HCUP databases – auxiliary databases that are used to augment information in the HCUP State and nationwide databases.  These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to health care programs, and outcomes of treatments at the national, State, and local market levels.  The project includes activities such as technical user support, electronic documentation, central data distribution, training, and expansion into outpatient data, among others.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the DOE is planning a sole source follow-on contract (DE-AC01-01IA40017) for payment processing and verification support services in the countries of the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  In the absence of applicable Government to Government Agreements, a requirement is jointly held by the;  Office of International Science and Technology Cooperation (PI),  the Office of Environmental Management;  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,  Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology,  Office of Science and Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  Added to the list of Offices will be the Offices for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) since DOE provides direct administrative and contract support for its agency mission.  These Program Offices have an existing and continuing need to acquire the services of a non-profit entity having confirmed tax-free status in FSU countries.  The planned contact period is sixty (60) months from date of award. The non-profit entity must clearly demonstrate that it is exempt from such taxation or any taxable incident thereof by Russian Federation or other FSU country decree, order, law, or other evidence clearly demonstrating the legality of such exemption from taxation. Currently, the United States Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF) for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union,  1530 Wilson Blvd., 3rd Floor, Arlington, VA  22209 provides payment processing and verification support services to DOEâ€™s/NNSAâ€™s, Office of Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (GIPP) within the FSU.  CRDF has in-country resources and capabilities in the FSU for making payments to former weapons institutes, scientists, engineers and support staff.  While other Government and commercial entities may have such capabilities, none have responded to date previous sources sought notices for identical support services for DOEâ€™s programs. It is DOEâ€™s intent to issue a sole source contract its Office of International Science and Technology Cooperation via a the firm-fixed price, rate structure, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task assignment contract to CRDF for the services described above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort is based upon this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to send in its capability statements via electronic submission to matthew.phelps@hq.doe.gov, limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received with 11 days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSEMENT OFFICE EQUIPMENT: Multifunctional Devices (MFDs) GSA Schedule 36, and Printers GSA Schedule 70.  A National Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of  Office Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories) This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.   This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time.  Background: The FAA at its nine Regional Offices, two Centers, as well as at headquarters and at other locations, employs a variety of purchasing processes to acquire equipment, services and supplies used in the furtherance of agency missions and goals. Purchasing processes are defined as the purchase of supplies and services through various means, including purchase cards, interagency agreements, GSA schedules, as well as through direct single source and competitive procurements.   These purchasing processes are generally not closely coordinated across purchasing domains within the agency.  The FAA's Chief Financial Officer has determined that coordination and restructuring of these purchasing processes will lead to reduced costs and increased efficiencies.  One of the major objectives in the FAA Flight Plan is to control costs while delivering quality customer service.  To help achieve the Flight Plan of controlling costs, the FAA has embarked on an important agency-wide strategic sourcing initiative.  This initiative is called Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program. The Program will include all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.     The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less.  With the support of the FAA's Chief Financial Officer, usage of this vehicle will be strongly encouraged agency-wide and monitored for compliance so we may realize savings and control costs. This procurement will not be set aside for small business. All awards will be based on a best value analysis. We will be releasing a Screening Information Request (SIR) in the next few weeks. Please monitor our announcement site.   In addition, we plan on utilizing the latest electronic processes for online offers and proposal receipt for the commodity SIR as appropriate.  We may ask for Best and Final Offers, and we are considering the use of on-line reverse auctioning to obtain the best pricing and request your comments.  Capability: It is the FAA's intent to contract with a commercial office equipment supply company that is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 36 for multifunctional devices (MFDs), and GSA Schedule 70 for printers.  The draft statement of work (SOW) for Office Equipment is attached and includes draft specifications for basic models to complex workstations in order to cover the entire spectrum of user requirements (fax and e-mail capabilities, maintenance agreements, etc.).  The FAA intends to gather pricing for both purchases and leases to ensure user needs are met across all organizations. The accompanying attachments reference specifications for printers and MFDs by speed and reproduction type.  We are seeking feedback on our proposed specifications for 5 black and white models, segmented by speed for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 or greater pages per minute.  Also, we are looking for two color models with speed segmentation of 25 and 45 or greater pages per minute.   The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the procurement (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract), which will be 5 years, including the base period of one year, and four option periods of one year each. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 423420, Office Equipment Merchant Wholesalers, and 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers. Instructions: 1) review the attached draft statement of work including the Multifunction Device (MFD) specification and Printer  specification (Excel files) and provide your comments; and 2) address the questions below; 3) completion of the attached Business Declaration form. This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Please answer the following questions and reply back via email: 1)	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 70? 2)	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 36? 3)	Does your firm sell a full range of multifunctional devices defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 4)	Does your firm sell a full range of printers as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 5)	Does your firm currently have a contract for multifunctional devices and/or printers with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide additional information. 6)	Is your firm capable of meeting the delivery time frames to the locations listed in the SOW? 7)	Is your firm capable of providing energy producing products qualified through the Electronics Products Environmental Assessment Tool (i.e Energy Star, see http://www.epeat.net )?  If yes, please explain. 8)	Are you classified as a large or small business? 9)	After reviewing the SOW, will you consider submitting a proposal? If no, why not. 10)	Are any of the SOW Section C requirements unreasonably restrictive? If yes, please explain? 11)	Would you consider a teaming arrangement to meet the requirements? 12)	Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW to assist the FAA in achieving the highest overall cost savings and best value (i.e. delivery timeframes, pricing methods, leave vs. buy, etc.), efficiency (ordering, reporting, service agreements, etc.), and/or compliance with federal mandatory purchasing requirements (CPG, Energy Policy Act of 2005, etc.).  In addition to your responses to the previous questions, we welcome any feedback you may have on our technical requirements. Your not submitting a response to this survey will not affect your firm's ability to respond to a future SIR.   Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by going to FAA's Contract Opportunity website. http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this request.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  Specifications are subject to change in proposal.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational request only.  No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

This initiative is called Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program.  The Program will include all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.   The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less while maintaining or improving quality of purchases and our suppliers' service levels.  Initially, these commodities include: 1) non-National Airspace Systems IT hardware (enterprise servers, peripherals, printers) and software;2) Accounting (ABA) related IT services; 3) general office supplies; 4) office equipment (including leased and purchased copiers); 5) overnight mail; 6) printing; and 7) guard services.  An evaluation of how and from whom the FAA currently purchases these commodities has been conducted.  Based on this evaluation, we will be implementing new procurement vehicles such as Basic Purchasing Agreements, Purchase Orders and Contracts.  We are striving to have as few procurement vehicles as is practicable contingent on the commodity area.  For example, we may have only one for office supplies, one for office equipment, one for overnight mail, and possibly several for Guard Services.  With the support of the FAA's Chief Financial Officer, usage of these vehicles will be strongly encouraged agency wide and monitored for compliance so we may realize savings and control costs.  All awards will be based on a best value analysis.   We will be releasing Screening Information Requests (SIRs) for each commodity area and will commence with office supplies and equipment SIRs in the April/May timeframe with the remaining commodity area SIRs to closely follow. In addition we plan to utilize the latest electronic processes for online bidding & proposal receipt for the commodity SIRs as appropriate.  Additional information and instructions specific to each commodity will be included in those individual commodity area SIRs. The DRAFT statement of work (SOW) for the IT Hardware commodity is attached.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the procurement. We are requesting information to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions: 1.	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 70? 2.	Does your firm sell Sun servers as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 3.	Does your firm sell a full range of hardware peripherals (including network peripherals) as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 4.	Does your firm currently have a contract with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide detailed information. 5.	Is your firm capable of providing an internet based web portal for use by only the FAA? 6.	Is your firm capable of providing asset tags (bar code labels) as described in the SOW?  If yes, please explain your process. 7.	Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW to assist the FAA in achieving the highest overall cost savings (e.g., longer delivery timeframes, pricing methods) and efficiency (e.g., web portal, reporting). 2. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.)  If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business, or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 3. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.

LOGISTICS TENETS APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:

CONTRACT REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CREP)

EARLY INDUCTION:
(a)     The Government will forward a list of projections of total contractor overhaul inductions and the number of high-priority overhaul inductions out of this total for each ELIN on this contract every three months.  This projection list will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO).  The first projection list will be forwarded within 14 days after award of this contract.
(b)     This list of projections by ELIN is provided for planning purposes and may result in a contractor’s decision to induct the high-priority overhaul induction projections quantities and non high-priority overhaul projections quantities at the risk of the Contractor, in order to meet the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority order quantities and the 30-day delivery schedule for the non high-priority delivery order quantities.
(c)      The Government shall issue delivery orders that indicate both the high-priority quantities and non high-priority quantities.  The Contractor will only be paid for the quantities placed on order.
(d)      The Contractor will not be held to the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority or the 30-day delivery schedule for non high-priority delivery ordering quantities that exceed the aggregate 6 month overhaul induction projections for either the high-priority or non high-priority categories, respectively, during the three-month period after the Government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections.  For ordering quantities that exceed such quarterly projections, a 60 day delivery schedule will apply.

CONSOLIDATED REPARABLE INVENTORY (CRI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Reparable Inventory (CRI) at the Contractor’s facility.    The Contractor shall act as the CRI to store reparable items shipped directly from designated Field Units, an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or from another Contractor’s facility.
(b)     The Consolidated Reparable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the listed yearly quantities for each and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each.  Disposition instructions for items in excess of the maximum level shall be provided by the PMS or Contracting Officer.
(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor’s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor’s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor’s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix “A” Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a “Final Reconciliation Delivery Order” to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it’s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the “Disputes Clause”, at the government’s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor’s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government’s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to “Rob-back” subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250’s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) will be required at the contractors facility.  The Government requests that this be not separately priced and included in the quoted prices for the actual overhaul services.

A Preaward Survey is required if the apparent successful offer is not a previously proven overhaul service supplier for both NSN’s. 

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation will identify the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in the planned solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer, their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS CLAUSE SHALL APPLY.  NO OBLIGATION MAY BE INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL FUNDS AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN CERTIFIED.

<DESC>Brand Name Justification:

The facility where the equipment will be used is composed of a network of multi-platform systems, large format flat panel plasma displays and audio/video equipment such as VCRs, LCD Projector Systems, etc.  The setup, installation, evaluation, tests and demonstration of various in-house programs utilizing the aforementioned equipment requires restaging for each program to be implemented.  To alleviate a majority of time that it takes for the restaging process a prototype KVM switching system was procured from Black Box that was constructed using specific components and demonstrated to function as required.  As a result of this success the current infrastructure will be supplemented, enhanced and expanded.  The requested Black Box accessories are state-of-the-art customized apparatus specifically designed to interface with all equipment utilized within the facility.  Utilizing components other than specified has resulted in configurations that do not function properly for the purpose intended or cannot interface properly to the environment.

Solicitation Number:  GS-03P-06-CD-C-0067

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to replace the boiler system and related parts located in the Mt. Hope Federal Building in Mt. Hope, WV.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 – Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238220, and this procurement is open to both large and small business concerns.

The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.  This effort includes comprehensive review and analysis of key activities currently underway thoughout the command; application of and implementation recommendations for leadership frameworks including Alignment, Execution Readiness, and Change Leadership; and analysis identifying gaps and demonstrated best practices within the Command to successfully accelerate the Second Fleet transformation.

The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) has a requirement for the development and demonstration of a Organic Reeling Cable Assembly (ORCA) system.  This effort encompasses all analysis, system engineering and design, development, fabrication, assembly, testing, qualification, logistics support development, planning, and management required to ensure the successful demonstration of a fully operational, production-ready system. The ORCA will operate with (1) the Carriage, Stream, Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) to pay out the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) common tow cable, (2) the Remote Minehunting System (RMS) to pay out the Variable Depth Sensor (VDS) tow cable, and (3) the Organic Airborne and Surface Influence System (OASIS) towed body to pay out the OASIS sweep cable, for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.  In addition, the ORCA will allow for replacement of each of the various cables.  The ORCA shall be operated with the CSTRS winch both on and off the MH-60S helicopter.  The ORCA design shall include provisions to allow the CSTRS winch to be mounted so that proper tension can be generated and maintained during the tow cable removal, installation, and inspection processes when CSTRS is not located on the MH-60S.  The ORCA shall be capable of handling the OAMCM common tow cable, the VDS tow cable, and the OASIS sweep cable without damage to the cables or the respective!   winch systems. These operations will be conducted in three locations:  onboard the LCS class ships, at shore-based facilities, and, as a Government option, onboard DDG-class ships (for the RMS/VDS system only).   The end product of this effort will be a fully tested and operational ORCA that meets or exceeds the requirements of the system specification.  The specific objectives of this contract are: (1) Delivery of two (2) ORCA Engineering Development Models (EDMs) with corresponding spare parts to support testing. (2) Demonstration of system performance that meets or exceeds the requirements as established in the ORCA specification.   (3) Demonstration that the ORCA system concept is both operationally effective and operationally suitable. (4) Production of a complete and accurate Technical Data Package (TDP) detailing the system design and documentation including elements such as Acquisition Logistics Support (ALS), training, operation, and maintenance.  The TDP must be suitable for completing any follow-on full rate production requirements. A Prospective Bidder’s Conference is scheduled for 0900 AM CST on 12 May 2006 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL Building 110, Auditorium.  Any company interested in attending the conference must submit a visit request including company name and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, and the names of all individual attendees (3 maximum).

In advance of the bidder’s conference, the Government will release a draft Performance Specification and Statement of Work (SOW) to requesting companies who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) for receipt of military critical technical data. (Information on the certification process is available at the following website:  <http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/default.asp>.)   Requests for the draft documents must contain the requesting company’s DLIS certification number, Commercial and Government Entity (CAG!  E) Code, point-of-contact, e-mail address, and telephone number, and must be e-mailed to Robert.Kuczenski@navy.mil; no telephone or fax requests will be accepted.  Questions and comments concerning the Performance Specification and SOW must be e-mailed to Robert.Kuczenski@navy.mil no later than 5 May 2006.  “Questions” will be addressed at the bidder’s conference; “comments” will be kept confidential and will not be addressed unless they are resubmitted at the conference.

<DESC>Services include, but are not limited to design and engineering services for the preparation of final plans, specifications and cost estimates for FY08 MCON P-587 Pacific Fleet Sub Drive-In MSF, Beckoning Point, Hawaii.  The proposed project will construct a new 213-meter (700-foot) non-magnetic concrete slip pier at Beckoning Point, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to support a drive-in solenoid structure, similar to the Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSF) at Kings Bay, Georgia.  The work will include demolition of the existing two-story wooden pier and walkway bridge, and the existing marine rail with winch, shed and compressor; removal of the existing Z loop system; construction of new pile supported pier with overhead trusses at 14.78 meters (48.5 feet) above mean high water; construction of a pedestrian bridge; constructions of sewer connections on pier and sewer piping from pier to holding tank on shore; construction of a 411 square meter (4,425-square foot) Rectifier and Substation Building for the D.C. rectifiers, transformers, and holding vault; construction of air conditioning and ventilation for Rectifier and Substation Building; provision for telephone and local area network services and electrical utilities; installation of cable trays for the X, Y & Z loop cables (installation of cables by separate OPN funding).  Fire protection requirements include installation of fire hose cabinets and fire alarm system along pier and wet pipe fire sprinklers, FM-200 system, and fire alarm system for the rectifier building.  The deperming operation produces high-intensity magnetic fields during the treatment of the submarine which requires structures to be constructed with materials that have a low magnetic permeability property. Local common concrete aggregates were tested and were not acceptable.  Aggregates with low magnetic permeability property may have to be imported from out of state.  Other materials affected include concrete rebar, fenders, mooring, cleats, cable supports and all steel hardware.  Approved materials include Nitronic 33 for rebar, reinforced plastic for fenders, stainless steel or aluminum for all other steel supports or hardware.  Construction dredging will be required to obtain the required depths for the pier and the approach areas.  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify them and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  Follow-on phases may include post-construction award services; construction surveillance and inspection services; operational and maintenance support information services.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is August 2006.  Estimated design start and completion dates are October 2006 and September 2007, respectively, including review periods.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firms and staff proposed in designing major waterfront pier and wharf projects in seismic areas and corrosive environments similar to Hawaii and Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members in designing major waterfront pier and wharf projects in seismic areas and corrosive environments similar to Hawaii and Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 06 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 75.83% to SB, 15.8% to SDB, 14.23% to WOSB, 1.28% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2005).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.  The submittal/delivery address is Commander, Code NAVFAC PAC AQ11 (A-E Solicitation No. N62742-06-R-0013), Attn:  Mailroom (MS2), NAVFAC PACIFIC, 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860-3134.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake, CA intends to enter into negotiations for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) modification to contract N68936-05-C-0069 to include the additional requirements described below. This effort is being procured on an other than full and open competition basis to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Inc. The initial procurement was not synopsized due to urgency. The existing contract for integration planning of Story Maker's integration into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Air and Maritime Operations Center (AMOC) will be modified to include a pre-flight System Integration Lab (SIL) demonstration and flight demonstrations. Story Maker provides an overall reconnaissance architecture that stresses multi-service/multi-platform utility, interoperability among existing and planned airborne reconnaissance components, timely dissemination of intelligence information to operational forces, enhanced combat identification capability, and high payoff multi-use technology. The proposed modification will serve to validate the core fusion and situational awareness/assessment capability applicable to the AMOC. The briefing report resulting from the demonstrations will be delivered FOB destination to China Lake CA on or about 30 Sep 06.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The requirement is for the analysis and reduction of real-time driving pattern data already collected from equipment installed on over 500 vehicles and the development of a method to collect data on vehicle air conditioning usage based on the methods and equipment used to collect the previous driving pattern data. The contractor shall: 1)  Develop screening tools to process and quality assure/quality control (QA/QC) the trip data and develop screening tools to remove GPS data and other data fields that could be used to   determine the identity of the participating household or the identity of the vehicle owner.  Process the trip data using the screening tools developed and output to an appropriate database format to be archived and transmitted to EPA.  2) Develop tools to identify the roadway type for each segment of trip data for which roadway type can be identified from GPS data.  Process the trip data with the tools developed in this task and output to a new database to be archived and supplied to EPA.  3) Develop tools to retain the GPS data and other data fields while cleaning up the data sufficiently to prevent the disclosure of an individual person or household.   4) Prepare reports detailing screen tools and data processing developed and used. 5) Evaluate the feasibility of configuring the existing data collection systems such that they are able to record the activity of the air conditioner compressor and the air conditioner switch; configure existing data collection devices to collect, at a minimum, the air conditioner compressor activity (switching on/off) for each trip; and configure the data collection systems to collect the activity of the air conditioner system (i.e., when it is switched on or off by the vehicle operator). EPA research indicates that the Georgia Institute of Technology is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because the data already collected is confidential and will not be disclosed.  Any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days (before May 12, 2006 at 12:00 PM EST) of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  Documentation should be submitted to Jamie Sclafani at sclafani.jamie@epa.gov.

<DESC>See Commerce Business Daily Note 22. Notice of intent to award a sole source modification to an existing contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), 460 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA, 93940 for an effort entitled “Nonproliferation Study In The Area of Weapons of Mass Destruction.” The objective of this effort will be to leverage upon previous work conducted by CNS/MIIS to support DTRA’s mission of conducting strategic studies and analyses related to national and international security, chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, high-yield explosives (CBRNE) threats, homeland defense, and the global war on terrorism. This effort includes state and non-state proliferation-related activities, and the means and capabilities necessary to effectively and efficiently combat both current and potential CBRNE threats. CNS/MIIS will conduct research, analyses, conferences, and provide expert services that encompass a wide range of WMD subjects in which CNS has unique expertise to meet the requirements of the Statement of Objectives, such as WMD threat anticipation, preparation, prevention, defense, reduction, nonproliferation, counter proliferation, consequence management, arms control and disarmament treaties and agreements, safety and security of WMD, and WMD development, production, deployment, transfers, reductions, and terrorism. This effort will build upon research and analysis conducted between 2002 to 2006. During this period CNS/MIIS developed vital expertise and provided DTRA with comprehensive monitoring and analysis regarding global nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons issues, missile proliferation, and terrorist groups. CNS/MIIS monitored the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery missile systems (NBC/M) in which CNS/MIIS provided research and analysis on threats posed by the spread of NBC/M, its causes, ways to respond, and future challenges, including those involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), terrorism and ways to reduce the threats of WMD terrorism. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, AND NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

CDI’s affiliate and business partner in connection with the continued development, marketing, sales and distribution of SCRAMscreen™ technology,   SCRAM Technologies, Inc. (“SCRAM”), has developed projection screen display technology that potentially improves the optical characteristics of existing projection displays.  This technology is proprietary to SCRAM, and is in turn based on patents held by, or exclusively licensed to, SCRAM.  SCRAM has licensed or sublicensed CDI for the exclusive use of this technology and these patents in military applications.  In an effort to assess the feasibility of this technology in the airborne environment, the U.S. Navy intends to contract with CDI to develop and demonstrate avionics displays based upon this proprietary projection screen technology.  The contractor will be tasked to develop an airworthiness certified unit as a conceptual replacement for the 20.1 inch AMLCD display presently deployed on E-2C Hawkeye 2000 (HE-2K) aircraft.  Work in performance of this delivery order is intended to assess the scalability and leveragability of the SCRAMscreen™ display technology.  See Note 22.

Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Interested parties who would like to be considered for issuance of a BPA should reference Solicitation W15P7T-04-R-J204, which appears on the Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) IBOP (Interactive Business Opportunities Page) for instructions on submission of Technical Proposals. Through 31 July 2006, the United States Army Communication and Electronic Command (CECOM) anticipates purchasing the following components through Call Orders placed against multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) established under Request for Proposal (RFP) W15P7T-04-R-J204.

The following purchase quantities are anticipated: Objective Mount Assembly, 5855-01-246-6807, 3,927 units;  Headmount Assembly, 5855-01-246-8266, 11,868 units; Wired Housing Assembly, 5855-01-381-6048, 51 units; Weapon Mount, 5340-01-446-8588, 9,090 units ; Optical Cell, 5855-01-444-1231, 3,521 units; Purge Device, 5855-01-246-6815, 81 units; Optical Lens (Objective), 6650-01-444-1212, 2,450 units; Headset Adapter, 5965-01-444-1216, 27,641 units; LIF, 5855-01-379-1410, 31,889 units; MX 11620, 5855-01-398-61 67, 711 units; Gen II Tube & Magnifier, 5855-01-027-1554, 1,846 units; Battery Retainer Cover, 6160-01-444-1208, 12,279 units; Battery Compartment, 5855-01-444-1233, 497 units; Case, Battery Assy (Clip-on), 6135-01-447-8948, 826 units. For all items in this synopsis, the award criteria will be based on schedule as the most significant, then price, and past performance. In addition, for the AN/PVS-14 Optical Lens, 6650-01-444-1212, award criteria will also be based on the offerors production location and or source.  For this item, the offeror must identify the production source or his intent to produce the item himself. Award consideration will be given to an offeror who produces the item or acquires it from a second source in the United States. This criterion is based on FAR excerpts as follows.  As per FAR 6.202 (a) (1), establishing or maintaining alternative sources, a particular source may be excluded from this contract action in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources  for the supplies because it would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the supplies in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization.  As per FAR 6. 302-3 (b)(v)(A), it is necessary to create the required domestic capability for production of critical supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in the United States or divide current production requirements among two or more contractors to pr ovide for an adequate industrial mobilization base. See numbered note 8.

<DESC>Material World Modules (MWM)Outreach Program is designed to attract middle and high school students to a career in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The program was designed by Northwestern University under an NSF grant using materials science in a hands-on inquiry based teaching method.  This three year grant will establish a national MWM center and provide modules for deployment of MWM nation-wide. DoD has piloted Material World Modules, a hands-on interdisciplinary materials science program, in middle and high schools adjacent to several DoD laboratories since 2003.  The planned three expansion of MWM is one component of a Director, Defense Research & Engineering (DDR&E) initiative to build capacity i science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  The national MWM center will provide support and modules to state MWM centers for deployment in their respective states.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION.  The objective of this BAA is to conduct scientific investigations of the use of magnetometer  technology and its ability to detect 155 mm artill ery shells while the sensors are mounted on a moving vehicle.  The military mission envisioned for this capability is as follows: A magnetometer  is mounted on a mine protected vehicle such as an RG-31. The vehicle travels on roads at convoy speeds and in real time detects 155 mm artillery shells that are located within 5 meters of the sensors. The geo-location of the detections is recorded for use by follow-on activity. This program is intended to perform scientific investigations of  variables and trade-o ffs affecting sensor performance. These variables include detection range, vehicle speed, 155 mm shell variability (magnetic moments) and 155 mm shell orientation. A three-phase approach will be used for this effort, and contractors are encouraged to struc ture their response, including cost proposal, in this manner. The word target in the following narrative denotes a 155 mm artillery shell. The magnetic moment of 155 mm artillery shells varies significantly from shell to shell but the values are expected t o fall approximately in the range 0.6 A-m2 to 8.0 A-m2.  Phase I. Quasi static investigations. In this phase, the sensor performance will be investigated and quantified before it is mounted on the vehicle so that the effects of the vehicle can be separated  from intrinsic sensor performance. The objective of this phase is to derive a fundamental understanding of the limits of the magnetometer  in detecting 155 mm artillery shells (targets) and to investigate how to distinguish target signals from clutter sig nals (any measurable signal not caused by a target). Experimental studies of detection as a function of range, target orientation, and target magnetic moment will be conducted. Experiments will be conducted in a clutter free and a cluttered environment so that the fundamental limit of the sensor to detect a target can be separated from effects of clutter. The ability to locate the detected target using sensor data shall also be investigated. An investigation of useful detection features in the sensor data a nd the ability to discriminate target features from geomagnetic or other clutter shall be conducted. The sensor/target data and the knowledge gained during Phase I will form the basis for the Phase II investigation.  Phase II. Vehicle integration investiga tion. The objective of this phase is to understand the effects that the vehicle (on which the sensor is mounted) has on the magnetometer  signal and to incorpor ate techniques for mitigating these effects.  The magnetometer will be mounted on the vehicle during this phase, and an experimental investigation will be conducted to determine the effects of the vehicle and vehicle motion on the sensor/target signal. It is the Governments intention to provide a military vehicle, such as an RG-31 or Casspir, as GFE to successful offeror(s) for Phases II and III. The capability to accurately geo-locate the detected targets shall be incorporated into the test bed and into t he experimental investigation. Experiments shall be conducted to collect data as a function of vehicle speed as the speed is incrementally increase from zero to 75 km/hr and as a function of distance between the sensor and the target. These experiments sha ll be conducted using numerous targets for the purpose of determining how the detection signal varies over a population of targets. The target location errors shall be experimentally quantified.  Techniques shall be implemented to reduce the (expected) deg rading effects that the vehicle/vehicle motion has on the target detection capability. The effectiveness of these techniques will be experimentally verified. The investigation of target-clutter discrimination that began in Phase I shall continue as applied  to data obtained in Phase II.  Phase III.  Test Bed Performance Characterization. This phase consists of performance quantification of the sensor-vehicle test bed after all mitigation techniques have been implemented. The detection-false alarm performance  shall be quantified as a function of vehicle/sensor speed and distance from sensor to target in a variety of clutter environments. Target location errors shall be quantified.  All data collected during this program will be provided to the Government so th at the Government and its contractors can perform signal processing studies.

<SOLNBR>0106AN39664
<RESPDATE>051206
<ARCHDATE>04272007
<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Contracting Officer 7037871263     Sharon.Teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service has received several questions regarding the original announcement posted on March 14, 2006.   In response to those questions, MMS is replacing the previous announcement in its entirety. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study that provides MMS with the spatial and temporal analysis of overflooding on the landfast ice seaward of the Beaufort Sea coastal rivers between Smith Bay and Camden Bay and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS (FAR Part 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process) from parties interested in proposing on this requirement.   PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The name of the new study is titled "Mapping Sea Ice Overflood using remote Sensing from Smith Bay to Camden Bay."  PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to map the spatial and temporal extent of over flooding of the landfast ice in the Beaufort Sea from Smith Bay to Camden Bay from 1995-2007; document (a) the variability in overflood conditions between North Slope river systems; (b)  the potential causes of varying overflood conditions; (c) the effects of overflooding on the ice surface and on the seabed from past and present information.  Based upon the overflooding of landfast ice from North Slope river systems and the data evaluated from this study, document oil and gas pipeline routing and facility siting concerns. The prime objective for this study shall be to improve MMS's knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability in overflooding, and pipeline and facility siting concerns as a result of fresh water outflow from North Slope rivers overflooding the adjacent landfast zone during the late May and early June spring break-up period.  BACKGROUND: Detailed information on the spatial extent of overflooding does not exists for most of the North Slope coastal zone adjacent to the landfast ice. With the advent of development in the Beaufort Sea, this type of information is needed to address issues regarding pipeline routing and facility siting.  Analysis of overflood and its implications for exploration and development requires information on both the temporal and spatial distribution of ice overflood from the breakup of North Slope Rivers in the spring.  This study would provide baseline data and improve the accuracy of information for environmental assessment and hazard mitigation.  These observations would also be of value to the offshore industry for planning operations on the OCS.  MMS has limited spatial and temporal information on rivers overflooding the nearshore sea ice in spring.  Most of the collected data on overflooding is spatially constrained to area of overflooding seaward of the Sagavanirktok River and three years of overflood data for the Kuparuk River in the vicinity of Northstar Production Island.  In addition, Landsat imagery that provides overflood information has been collected by Stringer (1988, 1993) and archived at the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute for the Beaufort Sea.  A soon to be completed study titled "Mapping and Characterization of Spring Leads and landfast Ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas" MMS OCS Study 2006-068, collected RADARSAT imagery and interpreted landfast ice extents from 1996 through 2004. The MMS anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with an estimated price of between $400,000 and $500,000.  The period of performance is three years (36 months).  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall be required to (Task a) Review and synthesize literature, local information, and data sources into a Procite Database for those studies that collected data on overflooding of the landfast ice for the North Slope of Alaska. (Task b) Produce a coordination and permitting flight plan and conduct a helicopter field survey for one season off the Colville River Delta to ground truth the remote sensing imagery and quantify uncertainties of estimating overflood extents from remotely sensed imagery.  (Task c) Interpret overflood extents from satellite imagery for all North Slope Rivers for 2007 field season and compare with field data..

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, for an enterprise recruitment/hiring solution that can consolidate and modernize its current and/or future hiring systems, seamlessly integrate with other DHS services and non-DHS services (e.g., OPM¡¦s USAJobs and NFC¡¦s EmpowHR personnel system), and provide sufficient functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of all component organizations.  DHS will consider using systems based on commercial or government off-the-shelf software but will not adopt any solution that involves a traditional software development effort.  The DHS employee population is approximately 180,000 persons; application inflow to DHS exceeds 2 million resumes/applications annually.  In 2004, DHS filled over 28,000 positions.  DHS wishes to find, acquire and implement an enterprise solution that will automate the processes and business requirements including but  not limited to Workforce Planning, Requisitioning, Candidate Acquisition, Applicant Tracking, and Reporting/Analytics.  Additional key high level goals for this system are:  Automate the processes used to manage the full recruitment/hiring lifecycle; create a single portal for all job applicants; reduce manual processes and/or eliminate paper-based systems; provide an easy-to-use interface for all system users (hiring managers, HR and EEO professionals; and applicantsƒ{internal and external); implement industry best practices; and reduce hiring/recruitment costs.  Specific quantities and units of issue, delivery schedule, and destination information can be located within the solicitation document attached herein.  This requirement is being solicited under full and open competition.  It is anticipated that a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will result from this solicitation, to include both firm-fixed price and labor hour Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  Contractor teaming arrangements are an acceptable solution to meet the requirements.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 511210.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $23 million in average annual receipts for the previous three years.  This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation).  It is the Government¡¦s intent to award on initial proposals.  Offerors must submit a written proposal in response to the solicitation.  The duration of the contract is a one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  Potential offerors will have until April 13, 2006, to submit questions or comments regarding the solicitation.  These will be consolidated and a response will be posted on FedBizOpps.   Place of Performance:  The majority of the work will be performed in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  There may be occasions requiring performance outside of this area.     The anticipated award date is August 16, 2006.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-06-R-00200
<RESPDATE>050506
<CONTACT>Steven Bobby, 202.493-4786
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSEMENT OFFICE EQUIPMENT: Multifunctional Devices (MFDs) GSA Schedule 36, and Printers GSA Schedule 70.  A National Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of  Office Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories) This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.   This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time.  Background: The FAA at its nine Regional Offices, two Centers, as well as at headquarters and at other locations, employs a variety of purchasing processes to acquire equipment, services and supplies used in the furtherance of agency missions and goals. Purchasing processes are defined as the purchase of supplies and services through various means, including purchase cards, interagency agreements, GSA schedules, as well as through direct single source and competitive procurements.   These purchasing processes are generally not closely coordinated across purchasing domains within the agency.  The FAA's Chief Financial Officer has determined that coordination and restructuring of these purchasing processes will lead to reduced costs and increased efficiencies.  One of the major objectives in the FAA Flight Plan is to control costs while delivering quality customer service.  To help achieve the Flight Plan of controlling costs, the FAA has embarked on an important agency-wide strategic sourcing initiative.  This initiative is called Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program. The Program will include all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.     The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less.  With the support of the FAA's Chief Financial Officer, usage of this vehicle will be strongly encouraged agency-wide and monitored for compliance so we may realize savings and control costs. This procurement will not be set aside for small business. All awards will be based on a best value analysis. We will be releasing a Screening Information Request (SIR) in the next few weeks. Please monitor our announcement site.   In addition, we plan on utilizing the latest electronic processes for online offers and proposal receipt for the commodity SIR as appropriate.  We may ask for Best and Final Offers, and we are considering the use of on-line reverse auctioning to obtain the best pricing and request your comments.  Capability: It is the FAA's intent to contract with a commercial office equipment supply company that is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 36 for multifunctional devices (MFDs), and GSA Schedule 70 for printers.  The draft statement of work (SOW) for Office Equipment is attached and includes draft specifications for basic models to complex workstations in order to cover the entire spectrum of user requirements (fax and e-mail capabilities, maintenance agreements, etc.).  The FAA intends to gather pricing for both purchases and leases to ensure user needs are met across all organizations. The accompanying attachments reference specifications for printers and MFDs by speed and reproduction type.  We are seeking feedback on our proposed specifications for 5 black and white models, segmented by speed for 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 or greater pages per minute.  Also, we are looking for two color models with speed segmentation of 25 and 45 or greater pages per minute.   The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance of the procurement (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract), which will be 5 years, including the base period of one year, and four option periods of one year each. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 423420, Office Equipment Merchant Wholesalers, and 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers. Instructions: 1) review the attached draft statement of work including the Multifunction Device (MFD) specification and Printer  specification (Excel files) and provide your comments; and 2) address the questions below; 3) completion of the attached Business Declaration form. This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Please answer the following questions and reply back via email: 1)	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 70? 2)	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 36? 3)	Does your firm sell a full range of multifunctional devices defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 4)	Does your firm sell a full range of printers as defined in the SOW?  If no, please explain. 5)	Does your firm currently have a contract for multifunctional devices and/or printers with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide additional information. 6)	Is your firm capable of meeting the delivery time frames to the locations listed in the SOW? 7)	Is your firm capable of providing energy producing products qualified through the Electronics Products Environmental Assessment Tool (i.e Energy Star, see http://www.epeat.net )?  If yes, please explain. 8)	Are you classified as a large or small business? 9)	After reviewing the SOW, will you consider submitting a proposal? If no, why not. 10)	Are any of the SOW Section C requirements unreasonably restrictive? If yes, please explain? 11)	Would you consider a teaming arrangement to meet the requirements? 12)	Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW to assist the FAA in achieving the highest overall cost savings and best value (i.e. delivery timeframes, pricing methods, leave vs. buy, etc.), efficiency (ordering, reporting, service agreements, etc.), and/or compliance with federal mandatory purchasing requirements (CPG, Energy Policy Act of 2005, etc.).  In addition to your responses to the previous questions, we welcome any feedback you may have on our technical requirements. Your not submitting a response to this survey will not affect your firm's ability to respond to a future SIR.   Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by going to FAA's Contract Opportunity website. http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.  The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this request.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  Specifications are subject to change in proposal.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is an informational request only.  No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  Please submit your comments, responses, and questions by May 5, 2006 so that they may be fully considered to: Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steven M.

<DESC>Upon recommendation of the General Services Administration (GSA) Regional A/E Evaluation Board, the following firms, in no particular order, have been invited to participate in Stage Two of the A/E selection process for this project:

MERRICK & Company, Aurora, CO
CH2MHILL, Englewood, CO
S.A. Miro, Inc., Denver, CO




The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  A LEAD ENGINEER DESIGNER IS REQUIRED. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

A representative plan and other relevant graphics should be included for each project. 
(2)	PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state the parameters he/she will apply to the challenges of: designing limited scope projects for major public facilities; meeting federal standards and codes; addressing sustainable design goals of construction waste management, energy efficiency, and environmental responsibility; managing work in occupied buildings; and integrating new design into existing systems and infrastructure.

Foodservice Request for Proposal #GS-11-P06-YEC-0083
Response to Bidder’s Questions

Q#1. On page 10, Building 62 shows it being opened in 2006 however in the briefing the gentleman indicated that it would not be opened until at least March of 2007.  Please clarify.

Answer:Building 62 is projected to be open in March 2007. 

Q#2. You discuss additional foodservice outlets but do not indicate where they may be placed.  Can you be clearer as to which buildings will have these kiosks?

Answer: No, successful foodservice contractor may have the opportunity to participate in master complex foodservice planning.

Q#3. You have indicated that there will be large cafeterias in Buildings 2 & 3 which are situated fairly close together.  Would it not be more practical to have a cafeteria located in a building located at the other end of the complex?

Answer: No.

Q#4. In the briefing we were told that all deliveries would be throughout the logistics building and from there would be transported by the individual entities through the tunnel system.  Because of FDA guidelines for handling food stuffs, will there be sufficient cold and frozen storage in the logistics building?

Answer: Successful foodservice contractor may have the opportunity to participate in programming of the logistics building (currently scheduled to be open in 2009). During programming of this building foodservice requirement will be addressed.

Q#5. Who will provide the carts for transporting subsistence, materials and supplies to the various cafeterias, kiosks, and serveries on a daily basis?

Q#6. If the contractor is expected to provide, are these carts to be electric or propane?

Answer: Electric.

Q#7. Is the Government aware that FDA guidelines will not allow us to transport food products on the same cart as we transport trash and garbage?  Therefore two designated carts will be required.

Answer: FDA guidelines must be adhered to per the RFP requirements.

Q#8. Are we correct in saying that for Building 2 there will only be 150 people working in that building to support the large cafeteria?  All other patrons are expected to walk to the cafeteria from other buildings?

Answer: YES, campus buildings are “connected via tunnels and bridges”.

Q#9. The two cafeterias will be located in facilities that have less than 200 people and yet facilities that have over 1,000 people will only have a servery or snack bar, is this correct and please explain the logic for this.

Answer: Yes, major foodservice outlets are located centrally in complex.

Q#10. On page 15 we are shown the Menu Profile.  Are we expected to provide this level of service from the first day in August?

Answer: Yes.

Q#11. On page 18, (2) you say "If vending machines are operated under the contract, they shall be..."  It is our understanding that all vending is designated for the Maryland Business Enterprise Program under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.  Which is true?

Answer: All vending within complex will be provided by Maryland Business Enterprise program.

Q#12. In the removal of garbage and trash through the logistics building will there be designated containers for the food service?  If so, who pays for the service?

Answer: Yes, trash removal expenses will be paid by the foodservice contractor.

Q#13.Will there be a disposable grease holding tank located in the logistics building?

Answer: Space will be provided for grease holding tank, associated expenses will be paid by foodservice contractor.

Q#14. On page 20 we are told that we shall maintain an effective program for extermination of rodents and vermin, does this mean that we have to provide and pay for service for all kiosks, serveries, and cafeterias?

Answer: Yes.

Q#15. On page 26 under Operating expenses and the lists of allowable costs it does not show Trash Removal, Pest Control or Rent.  Are these allowable costs?

Answer: Yes.

Answer: The foodservice contractor is responsible for billing and collecting catering event costs.

Q#17. Who will pay for the cost and usage for the vehicles needed to transport food from the main loading/receiving area to the café's, and for the use to transport to the individual satellites and carts as well?
Answer: Foodservice contractor.

Q#18. What is the carry load - size and dimensions of the carts that will be used? 

Answer: Foodservice contractor is responsible for carts.

Q#19. Will there be refrigeration provided at the main loading/receiving area to receive, check in and store product per HACCP requirements?

No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  The POC is Ms. Michelle Armes, Code 0563WC, at telephone 812-854-3735, or email: michelle.armes@navy.mil. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Parvus Corporation, 3222 South Washington Street, Salt Lake City, UT  84115, under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) intends to procure the services of a contractor to assist CMS in the collection and management of the annual Health Employer Data & Information Set (HEDIS)data submission for Medicare Advantage. It is critical to CMS’s mission that we continue to collect and disseminate information that will help beneficiaries choose among health plans (consumer information); information that contributes to better health care through the identification of quality improvement opportunities (quality assurance); and provides for proper oversight and management of the Medicare Program  (program oversight).  CMS is firmly committed to the use of health care quality assessment and improvement strategies in the Medicare Advantage program.  Since January 1997 Medicare managed care organizations have been required to annually report performance measures from HEDIS.  

HEDIS is a widely used set of health plan performance measures employed by both private and public health care purchasers to promote accountability and to assess the quality of care provided by managed care organizations.  Originally designed for private employers need as purchasers of healthcare, HEDIS has been adapted for use by public purchasers, government compliance monitors, and managed care consumers.  

Annually, CMS collects a subset of the HEDIS measure set, including the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HoS) measure. CMS makes the health plan level data available to the public through media that is consumer-oriented.  

CMS requires an experienced contractor to provide and maintain an information system and IT infrastructure to collect and support submission of HEDIS measures data for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and generate a database on Medicare plans.  In addition to providing MA plans with data submission tools and instructions with detailed technical specifications for submitting HEDIS measures, the contractor must facilitate and provide technical support and assistance to individual MA plans as they submit data according to Medicare requirements.  This contractor shall have the capabilities of creating a system that is designed to develop new measures that will benefit the Medicare geriatric beneficiaries and accommodating the new Medicare Advantage PPO health plans and other program changes in the Medicare Modernization Act. The period of performance for this effort is base year with two optional years.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement that will be considered by the agency.  The statement must demonstrate that the firm(s) has capability to perform the required work.  All capability statements must be submitted via email to Joanne Day at:  Joanne.Day@cms.hhs.gov on or before May 26, 2006.  Capability statements shall not exceed 10 pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  CMS will not reimburse costs for submission of capability information. The NAICS code for this action is 541710.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a one base year plus one option year contract with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) to continue training and technical assistance to the 64 University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDDs). The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), located within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the Federal agency responsible for implementation and administration of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act of 2000) (42 U.S.C. 15001, et seq.).  The DD Act authorizes the following national grant programs: State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; State Protection and Advocacy Systems for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities' Rights; National Network of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research, and Service; and Projects of National Significance. ADD is responsible for administering these grant programs that engage in four core functions: (1) interdisciplinary preservice preparation and continuing education, (2) community services and technical assistance, (3) research, and (4) information dissemination. The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance, statutory compliance, and program outcomes across the national network of UCEDDs.  This contract will enable training and technical assistance to the UCEDDs that provide preservice preparation, community service, and new knowledge to fields related to developmental disabilities.  The training and technical assistance provided under this contract covers a wide array of activities, including training, consultation, information exchange and dissemination, promotion of best practices, and capacity building.  AUCD is the national membership organization for the UCEDD program. It is a 501(c) non-profit organization that promotes and supports a network of university centers on disabilities, which includes the UCEDDs, Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) Programs, and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers (DDRC).  As a membership organization, AUCD serves as a clearinghouse for the national network of UCEDDs and provides cohesiveness across the 64 UCEDDs.  The 64 UCEDDs view AUCD as a trusted source and resource for developing cutting edge, state of the art approaches to preservice preparation, community services, research, and information dissemination. For training and technical assistance to be relevant to the UCEDDs, it is necessary to have an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of the operations and needs of the UCEDDs.  Since AUCD is the membership organization for the UCEDDs, it has the unique insight and experience necessary for providing technical assistance to this national network. The 64 UCEDDs view AUCD as their hub for training and technical assistance thereby making AUCD distinctively qualified to provide such services across the UCEDD network. The 64 UCEDDs have invested time, money, and effort to develop this membership organization, which has created a level of trust the UCEDDs can depend on to provide the support needed to achieve the mission of the program. Due to its history and connections to the UCEDD program, AUCD is inimitably positioned to provide training and technical assistance under this contract. There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the appropriate training and technical assistance to the 64 UCEDDs across the United States and territories.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities including detailed documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements. The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following: 1. Experience in providing training and technical assistance to the national network of UCEDDs; 2. Experience in conducting workshops, conferences, and technical assistance site visits to UCEDDs; 3.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06
	2.  Questions from Contractor	s				25 April – 12 May 06

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified Small Business concerns capable of determining how hatchery domestication reduces fitness of naturally spawning salmon and identifying approaches to reduce these harmful effects. In the short term, the study will provide estimates of relative reproductive success of hatchery and wild lines in the wild, identify of key life history differences contributing to differences in viability between hatchery and wild fish, and estimate the risks to viability imposed by one generation of hatchery culture. In the longer term, it will provide quantitative estimates of hatchery effects on long-term population viability and will determine the best approach to managing hatchery populations to reduce domestication selection.  Deliverables will be: 1. Create two selected “segregated” lines representing extremes for run or spawn timing and one control “integrated” line of coho salmon to yield at least 120 total families  2. Track pedigrees of all wild fish returning to the weir using molecular genetic analysis to allow measurement of evolutionary processes in the wild “control” populations 3. Test whether individuals have responded to selection for run timing by comparing returning wild  and hatchery fish from each line; test response in correlated characters  4. Continue broodstock protocols (segregated and integrated) on returning and maturing F1 adults to allow trend analyses 5. Measure the relative reproductive success of fish of all three lines in a stream or spawning channel. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) will be awarded.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Estimated cost is between $1 and 5 Million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation document is available.   No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.

<SUBJECT>58--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR SBAND EXCITER SYSTEM
<DESC>This is not an announcement of a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information, (RFI), for U.S. Geological Survey, (USGS), planning purposes based on industry interest, price, and schedule information to design, construct, and deliver an SBand Exciter System to the USGS capable of supporting an uplink signal to achieve proper coherency with NASA standard Earth Remote Sensing satellites.  The satellite ground station at the Center for EROS in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, performs satellite SBand telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) for several missions including, but not limited to, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7. The station is looking for an SBand exciter which can properly sweep the uplink signal at a user input desired rate to achieve coherency with Landsat 5 and Landsat 7.  The SBand exciter must be able to take its input directly from an Avtec Programmable Telemetry Processor, (PTP), which would be a 2KBPS signal modulated on a 16 KHz sub-carrier at TTL levels, and then the exciter must linearly phase-modulate this signal onto the SBand carrier.  A more detailed list of specifications can be provided upon request.   Industry response is solicited to indicate level of interest, what capabilities are currently available, schedule information for design, construction and delivery for such a system, and commercial pricing information in as much detail as possible.  Proprietary data that contains restrictions on its release should not be submitted.  No formal solicitation or contract will result from this synopsis for industry information; any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.  Information responding to this request should be received within 21 calendar days from publication of this notice.  Any questions or further definition of the specification should contact either of the following: Michael O'Brien DCPF Senior Hardware Engineer Technical Support Services Contractor EROS, Mundt Federal Building Sioux Falls, SD 57198 Phone: (605) 594-2656  mobrien@usgs.gov  Or  Keith D.

<DESC>The Center for Information Security Services intends to negotiate on behalf of its customer, on a sole source basis with a commercial small business, LTU Technologies of Washington, D.C., for LTU’s Image-Filter and Image Seeker Software. The contract intended is under the terms of FAR Part 13, Commercial Items Test Program. The contract will cover unique reliability characteristics required for this customer. LTU’s Image Seeker Software can store data elements that are varied, such as videos, images, texual data, dates, numbers, etc via several tools. These tools such as enrollment application, the task service, the API will make it possible to manually or automatically populate the internal database with individual or groups of elements. For example, elements crawled from the Internet by a web spider can be automatically enrolled in to the database. Once stored in the database, any element can be accessed from the user interface at any time and then displayed, edited, deleted, or exported to another application. The user interface also provides tools to access sets of elements. More than 26 formats are supported with Image-Seeker and Image Filter using standard image codec libraries. Additional formats are being developed everyday and supported by LTU. The software technology uses standard image libraries to encode and decode image files and whenever a new image format is required, it can be easily integrated into the software package as long as a c or c++ library is available. The period of performance shall be one year from date of award, including a six month option period. LTU Technologies is the only known source capable of providing the required software. This action is taken under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, proposals received, within 5 days will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

CLARIFICATION OF SCOPE OF PROCUREMENT LIST ADDITIONS;
2007 COMMODITIES PROCUREMENT LIST ADDITION; COMMENT REQUEST

AGENCY:  Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

ACTION:  Clarification of Scope of the Procurement Preference and Sourcing Requirements for Commodities and other Products on the Procurement List; Additions to Procurement List. 

SUMMARY:  The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (the Committee) is clarifying the scope of the procurement preference and sourcing requirements for commodities and other products on the Procurement List and providing notice of those which are proposed to be identified as satisfying Governmentwide requirements and thus subject to Governmentwide procurement preference for calendar year 2007.  The full list of these products and commodities, identified by National Stock Number (NSN), noun name is listed in this Notice and may also be found on the Committee’s web site at www.jwod.gov.  Comments are solicited regarding the entire list and/or specific commodities as identified by NSN.  

DATES:  Interested persons are invited to submit comments on or before June 9, 2006.  

ADDRESS:  Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, 
Jefferson Plaza 2, Suite 10800, 1421 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia, 22202-3259.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION OR TO SUBMIT COMMENTS CONTACT:  Kimberly M. Zeich, Telephone: (703) 603-7740, Fax: (703) 603-0655, or e-mail Alist2007@jwod.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a) (2) and 41 CFR 51-2.3.  Its purpose is to provide interested parties an opportunity to submit comments on the proposed actions.

The decentralized nature of today’s Federal acquisition environment requires the Committee to more specifically consider and communicate the applicability of each Procurement List addition, depending on the type of product and scope of the associated requiring/contracting activities.  There are effectively three categories of products furnished under the auspices of the Javits-Wagner-O’Day (JWOD) Program, each with a different level of procurement source preference.  

The first category (the A List) contains commodity-type products that are commonly used in office and light industrial settings.  These products, when furnished by the JWOD Program, are widely available through multiple Government and commercial distribution channels, and are delivered to customers in timeframes consistent with industry best practices.  For most office supplies, this means on a next-day or two-day basis.  For oversize office products (e.g., chair mats), or janitorial/sanitary products, delivery times may be three to five days after receipt of order.   All such products meet the broad preference requirements of the JWOD Act and must be purchased by Federal employees whenever they will meet customer needs and will be available within required timeframes.  JWOD-authorized commercial distributors must stock the items, obtain them from wholesalers or, to the extent permitted, coordinate nonprofit agency shipments, to make A-List items available for quick delivery.  The commercial equivalents to these products, as determined by the Committee, are identified to the Government and commercial distribution channels, and are excluded from contract sales to Federal employees in accordance with the Committee’s regulations at 41 CFR 51-5.3(a).  If a Federal customer orders an equivalent item, JWOD-authorized distributors will substitute and deliver the corresponding A List product instead.  Examples of A List products include writing instruments, paper pads, desktop accessories, general purpose cleaner in retail-sized bottles, and disposable breakroom supplies.
  
The second category (the B List) contains more specialized or niche products that are most often designed and manufactured to meet the needs of a single Federal agency, or a group of customers with a unique requirement.  These products, when furnished under the JWOD Program, are typically sponsored by and have procurement preference for the specific Federal agency which defined the requirement.  The JWOD procurement preference does not apply to Federal agencies that are not identified on the Procurement List documentation for such items.  However, their placement on the Committee’s Procurement List affords such products sole source purchasing availability to other Federal agencies that may choose to use those products.  Commercial products that are equivalent to B List items are not prohibited on Government contracts or Schedule awards.  An example of a B List product is latex examination gloves added to the Procurement List for the specific requirements of the Transportation Security Administration, but available to other Federal agencies who may purchase similar gloves.

The third category (the R List) contains restricted products, which are manufactured under the JWOD Program for one or a few very specific military or civilian agency requirements, and are only made available to Federal customers through the distribution channels authorized by the requiring office.   Products on the R List are not intended to fulfill a broad Government requirement, and are not commodities.  Due to these restrictions, these products will not be offered in general distribution channels.  Examples of R List products include chemical protective suits furnished to the Department of Defense and tree-marking paint manufactured for the U.S. Forest Service.

In the future, when proposing to add a product to its Procurement List, the Committee notices published in the Federal Register will identify the category group (A List, B List or R List) to which the product has been assigned, and thus identify the scope of the JWOD procurement preference.  

In accordance with clarification of the scope of A List products provided above, the Committee is proposing to designate the following products as the A List for calendar year 2007.  Consistent with the provisions of 41 CFR 51-5.3 (c), this action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date for the approved 2007 A List date or options that may be exercised under those contracts.

The proposed 2007 A List is divided into three sections:

1. Products currently on the Procurement List that were on the A List for 2006, and are proposed to carry over onto the 2007 A List; 

2. Products that are now on the Procurement List in a more narrow or limited scope (B List) , and are being proposed for the 2007 A List;

3. Products that are not currently on the Procurement List but are being proposed for addition and, if added, would be placed on the 2007 A List.

STATEMENT OF WORK - GENERAL:  Since its inception the Border Patrol, Tucson Sector has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts. REQUIREMENTS: Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed. Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government. Age- the horse shall have a documented age between five (5) and ten (10) years of age. (Exceptions to purchasing an older horse will be made on a case-by-case basis.). Weight- the horse shall weigh no less than 900 pounds and no more than 1250 pounds. Size- the horse shall measure not less than 15 hands and not more than 16.5 hands in height.

List shall contain physical characteristics of horse (color, size/hands, markings, etc.); and price. SELECTION CRITERIA: The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service: Most riders have little or no experience. The horse must be capable of carrying 200-250 lbs. of weight for long periods of time (6-8 hours/Day). Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters. A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment. Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program. SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS: A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation. The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition. Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase. Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area. Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to “catching”. Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled. Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled. He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being “cinchy” during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution. Reining- The candidate horse should demonstrate a proper understanding of stopping, turning and backing with only a light to moderate touch of the reins. Excessive force should not be necessary during this process. Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts. Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse. Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on. TEMPERAMENT: All candidate horses should exhibit the “proper temperament” during the entire selection process. The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him. He must display confidence in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping sounds. Although the flight or fight response is always prevalent, the candidate horse must remain calm or quickly recover and not run off with the rider when startled. The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people. DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED: Current vaccination/Quarantine records. Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian. Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process. MISCELLANEOUS: The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service. This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria. The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate. The contractor/seller shall not, in any case, hold the Government responsible for the disposition of a medically or physically defective horse.

This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in any product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
Product 5 is triclopyr ester formulated in appropriate solution (and potentially including surfactant).  A total of 1480 gallons of the 4# a.e./gal formulation (traditional formulation = 5906 lbs a.e.) is estimated as needed.  This may be filled as 4# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.

<DESC>Africa Communications and Marketing Advisor

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as 
supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; 
proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number ADF-06-C-007 is issued 
as a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect 
through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-18. The African Development Foundation (ADF), a U.S. Government Corporation 
fostering grassroots participatory development in Africa, is recruiting one individual on a personal service contract 
basis for the position of Communications and Marketing Advisor. The period of service consists of a 16 month  base period with 3 one-year option periods. The contractor will be based in Ghana. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

Background:  ADF currently works in 16 countries across Africa and has an opportunity to position itself in a new light within the development marketplace. Over the past 5 years, ADF has undertaken a number of organizational changes and refinements in its business model, the most significant of which include:  1) adoption of a new five year strategic plan with very bold operational performance targets, 2) the implementation of a new client-focused performance measurement system, 3) a commitment to effect continuous improvements in ADF’s internal processes, 4) development of new strategic program partnerships to leverage additional resources, 5) a commitment to establish community development enterprise venture capital funds, 6) the establishment of an Africa-based regional operations office to provide better guidance and oversight to country operations teams, 7)  an enhanced commitment to provide organizational development assistance to its country implementation partners, 8) a commitment to document, incorporate and disseminate lessons learned from ADF’s on the ground operations, and 9) the establishment of a new division focused on improved communications and outreach with ADF’s major stakeholders and constituency groups.  

All of the above factors converge to underscore the need and opportunity for ADF to launch a high quality, uniform, consistent, customer focused branding and communications strategy as well as a comprehensive knowledge management and 
best practices initiative. These two initiatives are in direct support of two of ADF’s major strategic program objectives:  
1. To build sustainable development organizations and business advisory services that provide technical assistance and training to enterprises and community groups; and
2. To promote and disseminate international and ADF best practices, lessons learned, and successful models for African-driven development.  

Item 1.  Job Summary 
The Communications and Marketing Advisor (CMA) will work under the direction of ADF’s CEO for Africa Operations and in collaboration with ADF regional program advisors and ADF/Washington senior managers to implement a comprehensive program initiative called the Partner Communications, Organizational Development and Branding Initiative. The overall goal of the initiative and purpose for the CMA function is to provide support to ADF country implementing partners in 
identifying, promoting and utilizing best practices to develop world class enterprise development capabilities, build a 
uniform and consistent brand identity for all ADF partners, and to make significant contributions to the enterprise development best practice community. The initiative and function will have three major program focuses: 

1.Partner Organizational Development.  ADF’s Regional Program Advisory Team has an operational mandate to assist ADF partner organizations across Africa in improving and refining their capacity to provide consistent, uniform high quality enterprise and business development support to indigenous enterprises receiving ADF financial assistance. This requires the development and dissemination of a comprehensive portfolio of tools, products and services, protocols and communications designed to assist ADF supported enterprises to improve their operating processes and make it possible for the enterprises to operate effectively.

2.Knowledge Management and Best Practices.  The CMA function will also be charged with responsibility for leading the 
development and implementation of field-based knowledge management and best practices initiative. The primary purpose of 
this initiative is to ensure that ADF’s field entities are able to identify and document ADF’s operational practices that have been proven to work well and produce good results.  These will then be shared amongst the ADF field offices and with other practitioners with a view to learning from others and re-using knowledge. 

3.Branding, Communications and Marketing.  The CMA will also be charged with developing, implementing and managing a comprehensive field-based communications and marketing strategy. The strategy will include the development of an ADF-Africa Partners brand which meets the need s of ADF’s partners to maintain their own name, logo and brand – while establishing a uniform visibility and control over how ADF and its partners position themselves and collectively communicate ADF’s value proposition and strategic approach to development in Africa. This initiative will provide the foundation for ADF’s Africa Partners’ verbal, print and electronic communications and marketing. It will also seek to strengthen ADF’s visibility across Africa and within the economic development community, help ADF to identify and take on new strategic partnerships and to leverage lessons learned across the development arena. 

Item 2.  Scope of Work (SOW) -- Specific Duties

The services provided by the Communications and Marketing Advisor comprise a range of services, including: brand 
management; strategic planning; market and gap analysis; project and vendor management; organizational development and 
capacity building; writing and editing; and representing ADF publicly.

2.Communications and marketing -- strategic planning.  The CMA will be responsible to develop communications and marketing plans for the ADF-Africa regional office, country representatives and partner organizations. This will involve 
reviewing existing collateral and marketing efforts of country representatives and partner organizations, identifying 
strengths and opportunities for each office, assess the marketing and communications channels available to ADF and its 
partners (in each of the 16 countries in which ADF operates) to determine optimal communications channels and timing. 

3.Knowledge management, best practices and lessons learned.  The CMA will be responsible for creating a process, developing and implementing strategies for ADF Field Operations’ knowledge management and information dissemination. The creation of a process by which ADF field best practices and lessons learned can be identified, documented, validated, produced, disseminated and archived will be the first priority.  Other responsibilities will include working with ADF/Washington senior managers, regional team members, strategic partners and country officers in facilitating network discussions, generating and disseminating best practices and lessons learned to ADF local implementation partners,strategic partners and existing grantees, assisting the above to utilize best practices and lessons learned to improve their organizational capacity, productivity and efficiency, and product innovation and diversification. 

4.Organizational development and capacity building.  Organizational development and capacity building is a key objective in all of ADF’s interaction with country representative offices, partner offices and enterprises receiving investments from ADF. The CMA will offer consultative and training services to various internal and external operating entities who have critical organizational development needs. The methodology for this organizational development and capacity 
building support may take many forms, including but not limited to creating diagnostic assessments, offering program-level consulting and/or workshops, or providing online coaching and feedback. 

5.Project and vendor management. The CMA will be responsible to prioritize, manage design and production, and oversee

FACTOR 5 - Construction Safety.  The Government desires to do business with only those firms that excel in safety performance.  This factor exists to emphasize the importance of safety in and around all construction sites and at the base where construction work is being performed.   This factor consists of two subfactors that (1) will evaluate specific aspects of the offerors construction safety program and (2) will evaluate the offeror’s safety performance history by contacting references, including but not limited to clients, insurance agencies and subcontractors.  For purposes of this evaluation, Subfactor A is less important than Subfactor B.  Subfactor A:  Safety Program.  The offeror shall provide information that demonstrates a corporate commitment to construction safety by addressing the following: 1.  Processes/Standard Operating Procedures, 2.  Management Involvement/Commitment, 3.  Employee participation and training, 4. Incentive/Awards program, and 5.  Other safety program innovations.  Offerors shall not submit their Corporate Safety Plan to satisfy the response to this subfactor.  Subfactor B:  Safety Performance History.  Provide the number of mishap/accidents for the most recent 100,000-man hours of construction.  This information is required for the prime contractor and all subcontractors working on your jobsite. Your response shall address each of the following:  1.  Description of Accident/Mishap and whether prime or subcontractor event, 2.  Date/location of occurrence and contract title, 3.  Actions taken following accident/mishap, 4. Agency/client POC and phone number, and 5.  Employer (of employee affected by event) POC and phone number.  The Government will contact references for the purpose of validating the information provided in response to this factor as well as obtaining further insight into each offeror’s corporate safety philosophy.   The frequency and severity of events may have significant impact in the rating assigned to this factor.  The Government reserves the right to call any or all previous clients for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding your record of accidents and mishaps.  

PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past Performance is equal in importance to the Technical/Management Factors 1 – 3. Past Performance information is one indicator of an Offeror’s ability to successfully perform this contract.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The assessment of the Offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establish a level of risk (high, moderate, or low) for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the standing of the Offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.  Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction, timely delivery of services, adherence to contract schedules, subcontractor management, safety management, quality control programs, good workmanship, conformance to specifications, and fair and reasonable prices. Each interested offeror shall contact Nicole Rounay at Nicole.Rounay@navy.mil and Cc. Christine Owens at Christine.Owens@navy.mil to obtain a Past Performance Questionnaire.  The provided Past Performance Questionnaire shall be forwarded, by the offeror, to all Construction Team and Design Team references, under Factor 1 and Factor 2, and filled out accordingly.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted, by their references, via electronic submission to Nicole Rounay at Nicole.Rounay@navy.mil and Christine Owens at Christine.Owens@navy.mil.  The questionnaires shall be returned at least one (1) week prior to the bid due date, but absolutely no later than the bid due date and time. Since the Government will contact the individuals identified in Factor 1 and Factor 2, it is critical that these individuals be familiar with the project to answer specific questions regarding your performance.  The Government may choose to contact additional customer(s) not provided by an offeror and may obtain additional information through other sources, such as the Past Performance Retrieval System (PPIRS), and phone interviews.   In addition to references provided under Factor 1 and Factor 2, you may include additional references that are knowledgeable of your firm’s performance.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will focus on information derived from the projects that are most relevant to this project.  

PHASE II. EVALUATION FACTORS.  Please do not respond to Phase II factors at this time.  The following factors may be included in Phase II, and their full text will be provided in the solicitation.  In Phase 2: (1) the total of all Phase 1 and 2 technical/management factors; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Price, are considered equal in importance.

FACTOR 4b - Subcontracting Plan.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command has established subcontracting targets of at least 75.83% of the subcontracting efforts to small business firms.  Of the total subcontracted effort, the targets are a minimum of 1.28% to HUBZone Small Business firms, 15.80% to SDB firms, 14.23% to WOSB firms, 0.12% to VOSB, and 0.12% to SDVOSB firms.  Large business firms will be evaluated against these targets with more credit given to firms who exceed these targets.  

FACTOR 5 - Design Solutions.  

FACTOR 6 - Construction Schedule.

PRICE.  Price will be evaluated during Phase II in terms of reasonableness based on a comparison of the Government Estimate and other offers received.

The problem with the instrument is that it appears to be pumping down (after final replacement of seals, etc.), but the ion gauge is not coming on (and the instrument is not operational until this ion gauge comes on and out of its vacuum tripped status).  We replaced the penning ion gauge (in case oxidation was preventing it from operating properly), and this did not fix the problem.  This instrument is over 10 years old is not one that is commonly serviced.
