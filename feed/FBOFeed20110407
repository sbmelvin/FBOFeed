<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to WuXi Apptec, Inc., 2540 Executive Drive, St. Paul, MN 55120-1175 to provide the following laboratory testing services to the NIH/NIDCR Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Transplantation Center:</p>
<p>-	Virus Testing for Human Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Before proceeding into human clinical trials, manufacturers of cell therapies are required by regulatory agencies worldwide to show that their products are free from adventitious agents.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a multilevel approach to thoroughly demonstrate product biosafety.  The final product, as well as the material from the appropriate stages of the manufacturing process, must be tested to assure freedom from contamination.</p>
<p>This process must be employed by the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Transplantation Center, which is assembling a Drug Master File for the preparation of these cells approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Transplantation Center must perform adventitious virus testing of bone marrow stromal cells that are banked.  This testing must be done in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies as described in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 58.  Appropriate controls are needed and specific validity criteria must be met for each assay.</p>
<p>The initial work in preparation for submission of the Drug Master File (bacteriostasis and fungistasis testing, karyotyping, in addition to adventitious virus testing) was performed in conjunction with a number of companies on a trial basis.  In all types of testing, WuXi Apptec, Inc. was the most responsive to the needs of the Transplantation Center.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that WuXi Apptec has extensive experience and the expertise to meet these objectives in a reliable and rapid manner.  This expertise and experience is derived from the performance of literally thousands of successful tests specifically for stem cells in support of clinical studies and regulatory applications for the FDA.  This experience is unmatched by any other laboratory.  Also, the Drug Master File was submitted to the FDA indicating that WuXi Apptec would be performing the testing, and switching to another company would require a change in the Drug Master File that would have to be resubmitted to the FDA.  WuXi Apptec has demonstrated the ability to meet the FDA requirements by auditing data, and preparing final study reports by their Quality Assurance Group.  These final reports are appropriately designed for incorporation into required regulatory submissions.  Quality Assurance monitors compliance with regulatory guidelines through their internal standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380 with a small business size standard of $12.0M.  However, this requirement is not set aside for small businesses.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50 (March 16, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by April 12, 2011 at 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-161-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.  Responses may be submitted electronically to learj@nhlbi.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Sequenom Inc., 3595 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, California 92121-1121 to provide MassARRAY System Premier Service and maintenance plan.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Molecular Genetics Section of the Genome Technology Branch, NHGRI has upgraded the genotyping capabilities in the Finnish US Investigation of NIDDM (FUSION) genetics study to increase throughput and versatility as well as lower the cost of high throughput SNP analysis. In increasing the versatility we are able to optimize the type of genotyping reaction to facilitate smaller studies with a large number of samples as well as larger numbers of SNPs on few samples for association discovery studies. The MassARRAY System is critical for our ability to test as many as 36 SNPs in each multiplex reaction. This system contains custom characteristics that are integrated with our genotype database and analytical software developed over the past 10 years and has been optimized in our laboratory for the FUSION study of genes related to type 2 diabetes (Project no. 1Z01HG000024 COLLINS, FRANCIS - Genetic analysis of type II diabetes in Finnish population).</p>
<p>Since 1998 the FUSION research group at NHGRI has been using the Sequenom MassARRAY System to perform the genotyping necessary to investigate the cause of type 2 diabetes. The system is a multiple component robotic and analytical system which requires regular maintenance, calibration and adjustment by a trained expert engineer. In order to ensure the accuracy and the precise function of the system a regular maintenance program is required. NHGRI require a service and maintenance agreement to support the continued operation of the Sequenom MassARRAY and to continue compatibility. To use another system or maintenance service would be detriment to the ongoing studies. <strong>The Sequenom equipment must be serviced by License Sequenom Engineers/Technicians and no other source is acceptable.</strong></p>
<p>The Premier Service Plan Package provides one (1) preventative maintenance visit and unlimited emergency visits. Costs are to include labor, parts and travel. The MassARRAY&reg; System Components covered by the service plan are:</p>
<p>&bull; MassARRAY Compact System, Premier Service Plan: Compact Serial #BA060483<br />&bull; MassARRAY Compact System, Premier Service Plan: Compact Serial #BA060485<br />&bull; MassARRAY Compact System, Premier Service Plan: Compact Serial #BA080120<br />&bull; Robodesign Nanodispenser: Serial #043<br />&bull; Multimek Liquid Handler Model: Serial #304712APS<br />&bull; Multimek Liquid Handler Model: Serial #304445APS<br />&bull; Multimek Liquid Handler Model: Serial #304593APS</p>

The Ship Repair Facility (SRF) Yokosuka currently operates a 50 gallon per minute Bilge and Oily Wastewater Treatment System (BOWTS) designed and installed by NAVFAC-NFESC to process wastewaters generated by maintenance operations and offloaded from ships.
  Due to the solids loading and infrequent operation of the system, frequent fouling of the pre-coat filter occurs, prohibiting the capacity of the system from being realized as well as dramatically increasing maintenance requirements.  In order to better handle the wastewater generated from maintenance operations and wastewater offloaded from ships, NAVFAC-Engineering Service Center was tasked to develop a new bilge and oily wastewater treatment system capable of processing 100 gallons per minute, and capable of handling waste with high solids loading.  The complete system shall be automated.  The load equalization tanks shall be retrofitted with level sensors and High/High level switches to initiate treatment once it is energized and the liquid level requirements are met, and set off alarms once the tanks capacity reaches 80 and 90 percent, respectively.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government is seeking to lease a minimum of 3,400 contiguous BOMA Office Area Square Feet (BOASF) and a maximum of 3,610 BOASF for 10 years with cancellation rights after 5 years. The space shall be ready for occupancy no later December 15, 2011. The delineated area is within the city limits of Bridgeport, CT.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. If the Government remains at the current leased location, the minimum requirement will be 3,400 BOASF.</p>
<p>The space must meet requirements for fire-safety plus handicapped access in accordance with ABAAS guidelines. Space shall be located within a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious, professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest should include the following:</p>
<p>1) Building name and address, and location of space in the building.<br />2) Legal description<br />3) CAD drawing of space offered.<br />4) ANSI/BOMA defined Office Area Square Feet<br />5) Rentable Square Feet Offered <br />6) Percentage of Common Area Factor used to Determine the Rentable Square Feet<br />7) Estimated full service rental rate with a reference to the amount of tenant improvement allowance that is included in the proposed rate.<br />8) Number of parking spaces available on the premises.<br />9) Name, address, telephone number, and email address of individual to be contacted.</p>
<p>Submission by other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space. In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.</p>
<p><br />Expressions of Interest Due: April 18, 2011<br />Market Survey (Estimated): Early May 2011<br />Offers Due: Late June 2011<br />Occupancy (Estimated): No later than December 15, 2011</p>
<p><br />Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Information Tool Designers, Inc., (ITD), to modify a previously developed government-owned airborne network security simulator to add an engine control system, aeronautical databases, on-board computer system, entertainment system and advanced networking system capabilities. The simulator integrates industry and government aeronautical simulators to assess and identify network security requirements for airborne network environments in a controlled environment. ITD's previous experience in the development of the airborne network security simulator will be leveraged to develop the simulation capability. The Volpe Center requires the contactor to have unique knowledge of the existing airborne network security simulation capability, an engine control system, entertainment system, and the advanced networking standard. <br />The Volpe Center also requires the development of on-board computer test and use cases for security training purposes to be presented at a workshop for 40 airlines and vendors (users), a presentation at a conference for an audience of approximately 30 attendees regarding the previously developed airborne network security simulation capability, and for a US Government Working Group (all of these information exchanges are within 3 weeks of the award and are key user inputs to the simulation capability development). Using a tool that requires detailed prior knowledge, the Volpe Center requires an assessment of the engine control system, production of a report, and conducting security testing in the airborne network security simulator.<br />In addition, the Volpe Center has the need to leverage expert knowledge of a DOT-specific Certification Program, to conduct a detailed review of the program and produce an updated Assessment report.<br />Travel will be required to the following locations: Wichita, KS; Washington DC; Herndon, VA; Hartford, CT; Montreal, Quebec; and Portland, OR.</p>
<p>A Request for Quote (RFQ) issuance will be on or about April 22, 2011. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512 and the small business size standard is $25.0M.

<CONTACT>Kristina Brannon, Phone 8508820346, Email Kristina.Brannon@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5, but a market survey to identify sources that are capable of overhauling/rebuilding the AVDS-1790 model engines and CD-850 transmissions found in the M-60 model tanks. Broad industry participation is desired, but we are strongly interested in any proven techniques that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production. We are seeking proven suppliers with established solutions that can meet or exceed the overhaul/rebuild requirements. A "proven supplier", in this context, refers to suppliers that are recognized as a qualified supplier by the U.S. government at a Readiness Level (RL) relevant at the Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) environment. Examples are DMWR 9-2815-220 and DMWR 9-2815-223. This effort is in support of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin AFB, FL.
<p>Responses MUST:</p>
<p>1) Address the process of the evaluation of our cores and identify the process if our cores prove unusable.</p>
<p>2) Provide complete overhaul/rebuild capabilities description, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the requirements of this market survey.</p>
<p>3) Include detailed information regarding the components capabilities/performance (prior testing, dynamometer test reports, etc).</p>
<p>4) Include Readiness Level (RL) of the engine and transmission with justification IAW appropriate DMWR.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Availability objective is to meet a 30 day ARO turnaround on usable cores delivered for overhaul/rebuild. 100% ready to install upon receipt of overhauled/rebuilt power train components, IAW DMWR 9-2815-220 and DMWR 9-2815-223.</p>
<p>Quantity objective is that all overhauled/rebuilt components will have at a minimum a 1 year parts and labor with return shipping warranty applied to each order. Vendor will be responsible for return shipment of failed warranted items. On site vendor correction of deficient warranty action within 10 working days from notification of warranty problem is desired.</p>
<p>The performance and mission availability objective is that the 46th Test Wing requires a priority delivery procedure in place to allow a new engine, transmission, or both to be supplied by the vendor, from vendor stock for requirements that do not allow adequate time for a standard rebuild/overhaul core exchange to take place. Items shipped using this procedure will not reflect a non core billing cost to the government, being that the government will provide a serviceable core for exchange under this procedure upon delivery of the serviceable engine/transmission, or within 10 days of delivery. Shipping charges should include round trip transportation costs under this procedure.<br />The delivery timeframe for the priority delivery will be within two weeks ARO. <br />The standard delivery timeframe capability is desired to be within 30-45 days, but any time under 60 days is allowable.<br />Shipping for rebuilt engines/transmissions is FOB Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5000.</p>
<p>Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure and will not be used to establish the requirements for any future system acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>The tentative North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 336992 with a small-business size standard of 1,000 employees. For contractual information please contact Kristina Brannon, Contract Specialist; AAC/PKOBB, 850-882-0346; Nicole Anderson, Contracting Officer, 850-882-9188. This notice does not authorize an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation in this survey. Large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this survey. Responses to this survey are due 22 April 2011 @ 5:00 P.M. Central Time.

Respondents shall also include the Point of Contact (POC) for technical and contractual issues to include name, position, telephone number, and email address.

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT Larran Frasier, 410-395-7005<br><br>The Government intends to award a follow-on IDIQ contract of DAAB07-010-D-M013 to the qualified contractor. The proposed effort is for the continued execution of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) Foreign Military Sale (FMS), which includes system engineering, software engineering, testing, training, logistics and FSR supports<br><br>Description of Supplies/Services: The AFATDS is a multi-service (USA/USMC/USN), automated Command and Control and Communications system that provides automated fire support and coordination to all the services. AFATDS pairs weapons to targets providing maximum effective use of all available fire support assets. AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare).  AFATDS will perform the fire support command, control and coordination requirements at all echelons of field artillery and maneuver, from Echelons above Corps to Battery or Platoon in support of all levels of conflict. <br><br>AFATDS is composed of Common Hardware/Software employed in varying configurations at different operational facilities or nodes and unique system software interconnected by tactical communications in the form of software driven, automated network.  The AFATDS totals 2.8 million source lines of code that is a mix of approximately 93% Ada, 5% Java and the remaining in C and C++.  The AFATDS server encompasses seventeen computer software configuration items (CSCI) and is hosted on the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE).  AFATDS adheres to more than thirty-six different processing standards, twenty different human-computer interface standards and fifty different data transport standards; AFATDS interoperates with more than seventy other Army, Joint and Coalition systems.  AFATDS operates at SECRET classification level and requires compliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP). <br><br>AFATDS can also be operated as server-client configuration.  When AFATDS operates in this configuration, the Effects Management Tool (EMT) is employed as a client terminal of the AFATDS and operated via Ethernet or Combat Net Radio (CNR) connection.  The EMT is a Java-based client that allows user access to selected AFATDS database information including geometries, unit data and mission data through AFATDS external Application Program Interfaces (API) via Ethernet or CNR depending on the operational mode.  The Simulation/Stimulation (SISTIM) is a message stimulation and simulation software product that supports testing and training for AFATDS and EMT.  It is capable of transmitting and receiving Variable Message Format (VMF) based fire support messages using communications protocols, and performing simple messages response generation for several common fire support systems.<br><br>The contractor tasked to accomplish this effort must possess an in-depth subject matter expertise in the fire support domain, and possess thorough knowledge of the system architecture, software architecture and code for AFATDS, EMT and SISTIM systems in order to modify and enhance these systems for Foreign Military Sale (FMS).  The contractor must also possess expertise and experience in working with international country.  The AFATDS FMS implementation schedule is extremely challenged.  AFATDS FMS customers typically request to have the products completed, tested and delivered within 12 months after the award of the contract.  The contractor must possess product specific expertise, domain experience, and demonstrate the ability to accomplish the FMS tasks within the time constraints.<br><br>In addition to the expertise described above, the contractor must be able to support all technical, operational, safety, interoperability and security testing, be able to provide the requisite training support to the international country either at CONUS and/or OCONUS.<br><br>Please submit all responses, to include a detailed description of contractor qualifications no later than 14 April 2011. Responses should not exceed five (5) pages.<br><br><br>Responses are required by 041411  <br><br>POC:  	Larran Frasier <br>	410-395-7005<br>	larran.frasier@us.army.mil<br><br><br> larran.frasier@us.army.mil<br>CECOM  POC<br>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including HUBZone firms; certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking capability statements or prior experience on Developing a Mobile Device and Web Application for reporting adverse events associated with medical products. <br /><br />1. Purpose<br />The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile device and web application for reporting adverse events associated with medical products to FDA including an in-depth module for products associated with medical countermeasures (MCM). An existing mobile device application covers drug adverse event reporting. A similar application needs to be developed for medical devices. A module to collect additional information is also needed for medical products likely to be associated with chemical, biological, radiation, or nuclear (CBRN) attacks. The MCM module will be used to evaluate medical products as they are used and assess potential signals associated with safety and effectiveness of these devices before, during, and after any potential attacks. In using the data generated from this application, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and all of FDA will be able to determine any adverse effects associated with medical products. <br /><br />
<p>2. Background In the event of an emergency, it is possible that either fast-to-market devices will be needed or that currently marketed medical devices will be used in ways that warrant surveillance. A pre-developed post-market device surveillance plan is needed to systematically monitor for potential safety and effectiveness signals during and after an event of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agent attacks.</p>
<p>Surveillance of medical devices used with medical countermeasures (MCM) would allow us to capture needed data regarding potential safety and effectiveness signals. In addition, the information would be incorporated with existing medical device reports (MDRs) sent to FDA to develop a full picture of adverse events associated with MCM emergencies.</p>
<p>This surveillance project would not be specific to any particular device; rather, it will be available for the public to provide reports on any medical device use or adverse event during an emergency situation. A cross-CDRH team will discuss the minimum data elements needed for such a system and the types of devices that are likely to need enhanced surveillance under various scenarios. Based on the list of data elements and potential devices and in collaboration with a contractor, a website and cellular phone application will be developed to solicit reports from medical personnel and the general public regarding use and adverse events associated with medical devices. A protocol for evaluating these reports will be developed in conjunction with the contractor. The reporting system and evaluation methods will be tested for each of use. With need, the website and application will be available for postmarket surveillance of medical devices.</p>
<p>3. Performance Work Statement <br />A) Objective: <br /><br />To develop a mobile device and web application for reporting adverse events associated with medical products to FDA including an in-depth module for products associated with medical countermeasures (MCM).</p>
<p>B) Scope of Work: <br /><br />Independently and not as agents of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work described below: <br /><br />The contractor shall work with CDRH and its partners in identifying items/variables that need to be incorporated in the mobile device and web application.</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop or modify an existing mobile device and web application for collection of medical device data and collection of additional information for MCM-associated devices. With available funds in subsequent years, similar MCM-associated applications will be developed for drugs and biologics.</p>
<p>The contractor shall determine what information and formatting is necessary to comply with federal regulations related to the collection of identifying information and web-based data collection. Moreover, they will ensure that the application is compliant with 508 requirements.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct pilot testing (validation checks, quality control, collecting the data, and basic metrics) to ensure the web application is easy to use by the intended end users and functions as specified.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall develop algorithms for evaluation of reports and for monitoring of emergency events requiring MCM. These algorithms will be tested and improved as needed (at least every 6 months) throughout the contract.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure adequate security and encryption measures are undertaken in the development, testing, and transfer of reportable data to the adverse event reporting system(s) at FDA.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that the data for the MCM module can be accessed by the FDA for regulation and surveillance at any time and can be easily analyzed using standard statistical software (e.g., SAS or STATA).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide maintenance of the web application and generate reports over the course of the contract. If necessary, the contractor will provide training in the use of the application to end users and/or personnel at the FDA (e.g. via educational video or webinar).</p>
<p>C) Tasks:</p>
<p>The contractor shall attend all meetings (in person or by phone) as requested. The contractor shall develop a mobile device and web application as a collection tool for adverse event reporting. The contractor shall ensure that all legal issues related to collecting this data online are addressed and that the application can be maintained over time and scaled to accommodate an increase in volume during a CBRN attack or other emergency situation. The contractor shall ensure that the application interface is compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The contractor will be required to commit to scheduled and ad hoc telephone interaction with the FDA research staff. During the initial development phases, it is expected that weekly meetings will be held with the contractor and the FDA research group with quarterly reports being generated. Upon piloting the application, quarterly reports will be submitted with a final report for the initial medical device application, including application development, testing, and algorithm evaluation provided at the end of the initial twelve month contract.</p>

The projects awarded will be valued under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (under $150,000) and will fall within one of the NAICS descriptions shown on this notice. The data file contains the of qualified, interested AE firms so that as approved projects are identified we are positioned to utilize the Short Selection process, as defined in FAR 36.602-5, to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE Services. We believe the Short AE selection process will improve the competitive opportunity for participation by local firms in the vicinity of the individual project(s). We anticipate the need for a variety of AE services. Examples of some of the types include, but is not limited to; bridge and large culvert design, low volume road design, design of small warehouses and office rehabs to improved energy usage and safety concerns, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, design of high efficiency replacement HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems and safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying, geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?</p>
<p>For AE projects with an estimated value under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, agencies may review current date files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project. A price proposal will then be requested from the highest rated firm. If reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes.
<p><strong><br />Background.</strong> <br /><br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) is responsible for providing healthcare services to over one million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 33 states of the United States (USA). The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) is the technology center for the Agency, providing infrastructure, office automation, and patient data services to these healthcare facilities, which include large hospitals, medium sized healthcare centers, and small clinics.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose.<br /></strong><br />&nbsp;In response to the ever increasing requirement to reduce data center costs, OIT completed an internal study in Q2 2010 on server consolidation. This study determined that server virtualization, specifically using VMware, would be an acceptable solution for large Data Centers like those of IHS Headquarters. However, because of the complexity of the issues and the criticality of OIT IT services to the Agency, IHS requires an in-depth external assessment of the top twelve Data Center locations to identify the best consolidation methodologies, including but not limited to virtualization.</p>
<p>Once complete, this assessment will be presented to OIT Management for review and approval before any implementation occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives.<br /></strong><br />&bull; Optimizing, modernizing, and enhancing current operations, including hardware and storage expansion.</p>
<p>&bull; Developing consolidation strategies that meet the following Agency objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Improving and reducing current costs associated with lifecycle management, power and cooling consumption, and data center footprint.</p>
<p>&bull; Improving overall usage of server resources for efficiency.</p>
<p>&bull; Improving Disaster Recovery capability and Business Continuity planning.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong> <br /><br />This Request for Information is in regards to a potential Server Consolidation/Virtualization Assessment. The Indian Health Service is seeking information pertaining to how this assessment can be performed. We have multiple data centers at multiple locations with multiple server configurations all operating on the same network.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables.</strong></p>
<p>1.Capabilities analysis and gap analysis between the current environment and the best three potential solutions.<br />2.Report of findings and recommendations to both IHS Management and IHS technical staff.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance.</strong> <br /><br />05/01/2011 - 10/31/2011</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted electronically to Shannon Sartin at shannon.sartin@ihs.gov. All responses must be received no later than April 14, 2011 4pm PST.<br /><br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
Background
<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>
<p>The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&amp;IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&amp;IS's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&amp;IS's Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Center's Hospital Information System (CRIS).<br />The advanced visualization workstations are medical diagnostic imaging systems that utilize computerized visualization techniques to provide enhanced image displays, e.g. 3D or 4D displays.  The visualization workstations provide the radiologists with a means to further process and review the clinical diagnostic patient related images stored in the PACS.   Advanced visualization technology is needed by the NIH Clinical Center to make radiologic clinical diagnosis easier, faster, and more reliable.<br />GE Healthcare is the manufacturer of the GE Advanced Workstation Serer (AWS) purchased by the department in 2010 and installed and maintained under warranty through April 2011. As such GE is the only source who can provide the components required to maintain the capabilities of its AWS system.  The advanced visualization technology provided by the GE software is an important component of the Radiology and Enterprise's image viewing experience. The system involves proprietary software manufactured by GE and hardware designed to meet GE's exacting requirements. A seamless integration and the interaction of the hardware specified by GE is required to assure the integrity and functionality of the advanced visualization software.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p><br />This request is for the purchase of a maintenance contract with GE Medical for it's the GE Advanced Workstation Serer (AWS) for the period of one year beginning May 1, 2011. The GE AWS is a proprietary system in daily use by the RAD&amp;IS for critical patient care.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Construction Services for RM09-2494, Energy Conservation and Repairs to Submarine Enclosures at Dry Dock #2, Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

The contract will provide:
 
The repair and modernization of the removable submarine covers (RSCs), which are mission critical (MDI 97) air conditioned structures that enclose submarines during maintenance and refueling/defueling availabilities in Dry Dock #2. The RSCs are comprised of 17 stacks and 6 stair towers that will be disassembled and transported off the Shipyard to a vendor's facility to be blasted and painted.
 Project includes the installation of new hardware and fall protection anchors, structural repairs, and major upgrades to HVAC, electrical, fire protection and lighting systems. Additional work in Dry Dock #2 will include blasting, painting and minor structural repair of the west stairway at Building 343 and repair of the structural tie downs. Energy savings will be gained through repair of the 14 inoperable existing Rooftop HVAC Units (RTUs) that currently prevent energy recovery of conditioned air, thereby heating and cooling spaces with 100% make-up air. With air-to-air heat exchange restored, two high efficiency 150 ton chillers will be installed and attached to existing utilities to provide adequate conditioning to both sides of the submarine, as well as provide required redundancy in the event of casualty operation.
 Enhanced controls and metering devices throughout will regulate conditioning with new variable speed fans to react to opened compartments limiting heating and cooling losses. Further savings will be gained by cladding RSC units with additional R-15 metal insulated panels, and refurbishing existing insulation and weatherization throughout. Total energy reduction of approximately 76% is expected over current baseline operations.
The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. All Service Disabled Veteran (SDV) small businesses certified HUBZone small businesses, certified 8(a) small businesses, and other certified small businesses are encouraged to respond. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.
 This office anticipates award of a contract for these construction requirements by September 2011. The appropriate NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 and the small business size standard is $33,500,000. 
THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis. It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the contracting officer a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services.

The Range Operations Branch at NSWC Dahlgren (NSWCDD) supports programs which require the use of ASTM D 3699, Type 1-K Kerosene (un-dyed).  The Government intends to issue Blank Purchase Agreements (BPAs) in accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR to support the Range Operations Branchs operational needs.
 After establishment of a call/order, an NSWCDD employee will contact the vendor to request delivery of a specific or estimated quantity of fuel.  This request will be made by direct phone conversation with an employee of the vendor or by faxed request with confirmed receipt.  The vendor shall deliver the fuel to NSWCDD within 7 days of receipt of the request.  All deliveries shall be made during normal business hours (i.e., weekdays between 0730-1500, except for Federal holidays).  The fuel shall be delivered to the fuel tanker containment area located across the street from Building 481 at the Naval Support Activity, South Potomac in Dahlgren, VA.  The fuel shall be transferred on-site directly from the vendors tanker to the Navy tanker.
 The maximum quantity of fuel purchased per transaction will be 5,000 gal (i.e., the capacity of the Navy tanker that will be used to hold the fuel temporarily).  The minimum quantity per transaction will be 500 gal.  Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and services and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. There is no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. All calls/orders must be acknowledged by the selected vendor in order to be retained on the BPA calling list. The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this notice will result in BPAs.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">NRL is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to determine the general availability for the design, build, testing, installation, and on-site final testing of one </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="X-NONE">Ambient Aerosol Test Chamber (AATC)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The AATC</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="X-NONE"> will provide a capability for performance evaluation of developmental DoD biological and chemical warfare (BW &amp; CW) aerosol sensors using ambient air as a background for false positive rate measurement. It is intended to serve as an intermediate step between an early developmental proof-of-concept laboratory setting, and a field-test situation, by providing NRL and DoD developers with long-term ambient air sampling located within a secure, controlled environment. The AATC will sample outdoor air at variable rates on a continuous basis, and simulate realistic attacks by interjecting known laboratory aerosols with controlled concentrations at pre-programmed times and durations into that sample.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span>&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the system must adhere to the following specifications:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

The Aerosol Laboratory is 37&rsquo; x 15&rsquo; x 14&rsquo; high. The exterior access door is 3&rsquo;0&rdquo; (34.5&rdquo;) x 7&rsquo; (68&rdquo;). The manufacturer is responsible for all hardware installation, start-up and demonstration of the complete Ambient Aerosol Test Chamber. The manufacturer is responsible for any precast wall and/or roof penetrations. The manufacturer is responsible for electrical connection from the supplied &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; on the North wall. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">System Features:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Flow Tube</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.01 The system must provide a <span>circular cross section with a minimum diameter of 30 centimeter.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.02 The system must<span> be segmented in sections from 90 to 120 cm in length that can be decoupled for scheduled cleaning.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.03 The system must provide air-tight seals between each individual section. These seals must be capable of being taken apart for cleaning of the flow tube sections and reassembled providing the sealed environment again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.04 The manufacturer must provide a means of support for each individual section of the flow tube.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.05 <span>The main system will be located within the Aerosol Laboratory but will draw outside air in and exhaust to the outside of the building.<span>&nbsp; </span>The inlet for ambient air should be a straight, unimpeded tube that extends through the outside (west) wall of the lab and extends a minimum of 10 feet from the outside building wall.<span>&nbsp; </span>A bell-mouth inlet is preferable. Air will be exhausted through a roof mounted blower supplied with the system. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1.06 In addition to the ambient air inlet, there must be a provision for drawing outside air through a HEPA filter to provide the plenum flow of the AATC.<span>&nbsp; </span>This will require a union of the two inlet tubes (ambient and HEPA filtered) and a valve arrangement so that when one is open the other can be closed.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is preferable to have this arrangement mounted outside the building to preserve working space in the lab and to minimize the number of wall penetrations.<span>&nbsp; </span>The HEPA filter assembly and valve arrangement must be weather-proof. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Velocity</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">2.01 The system air velocity must be controllable from 0-15 meters per second.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">2.02 The system air velocity must achieve an upper limit of 15 meter per second regardless of the flow tube diameter. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">2.03 The system must provide a means of monitoring flow velocity. This must be accomplished by either a flow rate monitor or flow velocity monitor.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Flow</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">3.01 The system must provide variable flow of <span>0 - 60 m<sup>3</sup>/minute. The total flow rates will depend on actual diameter of the flow tube.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Test section</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">4.01 The system test section should be designed to be utilized at a working height of 60&rdquo;. This height should be the centerline of the complete flow tube system (no bends or turns from the outside inlet to the test section). The test section center should be located approximately 60&rdquo; from the interior north wall of the lab. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">4.02 To aid in the ability to regularly clean the system the test section must be movable on a wheeled support once detached from the system. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">4.03 The test section must have a square cross section with smooth transitions to circular tube sections at each end of the test section. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Test Aerosol Generators</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.01 The system must provide three independent aerosol generation sources and be expandable to six independent aerosol generation sources.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.02 The system must provide one liquid droplet generator and be expandable to three.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.03 The system must provide one powder generator and be expandable to three.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.04 The method by which the generated aerosol particles/droplets are introduced to the main tube flow should result in a uniform distribution of particles over a cross section of the flow just prior to the test section (above).<span>&nbsp; </span>The uniformity requirement can either be demonstrated directly or referenced to prior design test reports/evaluations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.05 For the liquid droplet generators, the primary droplet size distribution should fall primarily in the range of 30 - 60 micron diameter, and should be capable of generating a total maximum droplet rate of 100,000 to 150,000 droplets/sec.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">5.06 For powder generators, the particle size distribution mean (mode) in the main flow should be as small as possible given standard powder materials (5 to 10 micron diameter for the mode size is desirable) and the maximum total powder aerosol production rate should be in the range of 100 to 50 milligrams/min (63 gm/hr).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Safety Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">6.01 The system must provide filtration of the air flow after the test section and before going to the blower/impeller. This must be accomplished utilizing an ULPA filter, or tandem HEPA filters unit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">6.02 For safety the system must provide an optical particle counter in the exhaust outlet that triggers visual or audio alarm with programmable alarm settings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Installation</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">7.01 The manufacturer must provide a weather-proof and sealed housing for any HEPA filter units or blower/impeller units located outside the room.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">7.02 The blower motor/impellor will be mounted on roof. The manufacturer is responsible for complete installation of the blower motor/impellor including roof penetration and electrical service from inside the laboratory. The exhaust stack from the blower must rise 10&rsquo; above the parapet wall (2&rsquo;). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">7.03 The main system will be located within the Aerosol Laboratory but will draw outside air in and exhaust to the outside of the building. The contractor is responsible for core drilling the flow tube inlet and outlet access hole. The precast concrete wall is 10&rdquo; thick and the roof penetration would be through standard steel pan and roofing material. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice.  This notice neither constitutes a solicitation announcement, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Responses to this Sources Sought notice will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.<br><br>The Afghanistan Engineer District South (AES) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified several projects it intends to award during FY11 each with a magnitude of construction between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  The solicitations will be unrestricted/full and open and result in firm fixed price contracts.  These projects will provide facilities and infrastructure for the Afghan National Army (ANA).  These contracts will address new construction utilizing either a Site-Adapt or a Design-Build (D-B) methodology to provide utility construction, general building construction, new road construction, and general environmental work including but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical and concrete work.  The primary building type will be K-Span (or similar rolled metal arch-type construction) or CMU.  <br>AES is considering the use of Sealed Bidding (FAR Part 14) procedures that would use an Invitation for Bid (IFB) solicitation type for these projects.  This is a departure from the typical Request for Proposal (RFP) acquisition method used in Afghanistan for this type and size of project.  When using sealed bidding procedures, award will be made to the low bidder that is determined responsible and eligible for award using FAR 9.1 procedures.  Bidders will be required to furnish with their bid a bid guarantee in the form of a firm commitment (e.g. bid bond supported by good and sufficient surety or sureties acceptable to the Government; appropriately drawn bank drafts, postal money orders, certified checks, or cashier's checks; irrevocable letters of credit; or, under Treasury Department regulations, certain bonds or notes of the United States).  The awardee will be required to submit proper performance and payment bonds (in a form similar to that discussed above for the bid guarantee) after award.  <br>Two of these projects (207th Compound Expansion, Camp Zafar and 215th Brigade Garrison, Delaram), currently are synopsized under W5J9LE-11-B-0001 and W5J9LE-11-B-0002 respectively.  Information received from this sources sought will potentially impact the requirements of those solicitations. <br>In order to determine the extent of industry interest and experience in this type of project and sealed bidding requirements, interested firms shall answer the following questions and present the following information:<br>QUESTIONS:<br>1.	Is your firm willing to bid on projects advertised as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) using Sealed Bidding procedures?<br>2.	If given the choice (IFB or RFP), which acquisition method would you prefer, and why?  If the method has no impact on you providing a proposal or bid, please state that you have no preference.<br>3.	If performance and payment bonds were required for an IFB, would that impact your decision to submit a bid on a project?    And if so, why?<br>4.	What percent of surety have you provided in the past in Afghanistan?<br>a. 0%		b. 10%		c. 20%		d. more than 20%     <br>e.  N/A (firm has not performed work in Afghanistan)<br>5.	Can your firm obtain up to 20% payment and performance bonding for complex and large magnitude projects in Afghanistan?<br>6.	Can your firm obtain up to 20% payment and performance bonding for projects not entirely within the boundaries of a current NATO or U.S. installation?<br>7.	Does your firm maintain readily accessible, up-to-date information regarding items a contracting officer may need to render a determination of responsibility under FAR Part 9.1?<br>8.	Would an IFB which required immediate submission of such responsibility-related information at the time of bid opening impact your decision to submit a bid on a project?    And if so, why?<br>INFORMATION:<br>9.	Company Name, Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number and CCR CAGE code.<br>10.	Do you currently submit proposals or bids for AES projects?<br>11.	Information concerning your companies ability or experience with the following:<br>a.	Capability to construct K-Span or equal metal formed curved roof systems as well as CMU building.  Discuss prior projects as well provide a list showing the type/quantity of equipment owned/leased by your firm that would be used for this type of construction <br>b.	Capacity of your company to perform construction projects in the range of $25,000,000 to $100,000,000 in Afghanistan.  Provide up to 3 examples.   <br>The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided.  The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.  <br>Companies or individuals interested in responding are invited to submit their information via email only to Mark T. Jones at mark.t.jones@usace.army.mil.  All attachments must be provided in either Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format.  Responses should be received by 4:00 p.m. local time, 12 April 2011.  PLEASE REFERENCE "SOURCES SOUGHT: W5J9LE-11-R-SS03" IN THE SUBJECT LINE.  <br> All responsible sources may respond to this notice and all responses will be considered.  Telephonic responses will not be honored. This is only a Request for Information. No award will result from this Sources Sought.<br>

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT<br />1. Introduction/Statement of Intent<br />The Forest Service (USFS), Tongass National Forest intends to solicit from and negotiate with, and award a contract for HVAC Annual Maintenance and Monitoring in Ketchikan, Alaska, to Control Contractors - Juneau, Alaska 99801, on or about April 14, 2011. A Request for Quote was issued under FAR 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. No written solicitation was issued. Quotes were obtained orally. Only one vendor (Control Contractors) was requested to provide quote.<br /><br />2. Description of Supplies/Services<br />The contractor shall perform annually a complete and comprehensive on-site check of all digital control components in each building listed in the Schedule. On-Site check shall include:<br />A. Contractor's technician shall meet with building operator/manager to discuss the overall system operation to determine if the operating schedule meets programmed time schedule and any known deficiencies, desired changes, or enhancements. <br />B. Review each system sequence of operation to verify that the equipment functions as originally designed. Check that set-points are being maintained, flow indication is working, and alarm functions are properly set up.<br />C. Review all connected points for bad sensor readings, flow indication problems, set-points not being maintained and loop tuning. Tune any loops that are excessively hunting.<br />D. Perform a visual inspection of major systems. Note any discrepancies and forward in the Annual Service Report.<br />E. Make calibration and field device adjustments as required for proper indication readings.<br />F. Review all application software databases and verify that such databases are maintained in accordance with recommended operating procedures. Perform a complete back-up of the most recently verified databases and maintain on file for emergency back-up and to ensure that both the Forest Service and the contractor have the most current database. <br />G. The database is the custom-programmed information in each controller required for the system to operate. Having the most recent database on hand ensures that there will be minimal disruption and expense involved in re-loading a controller should the database be lost or a controller be damaged. <br />H. Provide the latest firmware to keep all controllers at current revision levels. This allows the Forest Service to receive system enhancements and improved performance as developed. This also allows additions to be made to the system with the latest versions and models of controllers as desired. <br />I. Contractor shall not be responsible for host computer hardware upgrades or for significant enhancements to existing features of the operating platform.<br />J. Generate a printout of the Exception Log and Current Alarms, providing a quick reference to any problems that have been or are occurring in the system. Submit with the Annual Service Report.<br />QUARTERLY MODEM CHECK. <br />Perform four (4) modem checks per year, each check consisting of calling the site and establishing communication. Once established, review system operation by modem and generate an Exception Log and Alarm Report. Verify that all connected controllers are communicating properly. Report any problems found with the modem communication or system operation. Provide the Exception Log, Alarm Report, and any problems in the quarterly modem check report.<br />OFF-SITE SUPPORT. <br />Provide 10 hours annually for which the Forest Service or its Contractor can call for system support and manipulation. Generate a log of interaction or other time chargeable to the 10 hours and submit with the quarterly modem check report.<br />3. Total Estimated Value and Period of Performance <br />We contemplated in awarding a multi-year contract or an IDIQ- however there may be some changes in the future to the system. In light of these pending changes, it did not make sense to award a contract covering more than one year. Contractor Quote: $10,344.00<br />4. Authority: under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. <br />5. Reasons for Single Source<br />The reason for doing an annual purchase order is the job is small; only one vendor is licensed in the State to work on this system. No other services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />6. Questions<br />No solicitation document is available. All interested sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered. This notice is not a Request for Proposals, nor does it represent a commitment by the Forest Service to pay for any costs incurred by the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this notification. FOR MORE INFORMATION. The point of contact for this acquisition is A. Kay Steffey, 907-747-4273 (Fax 907-747-289), U. S. Forest Service, Tongass National Forest, 204 Siginaka Way Sitka, AK 99835. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, at the National Cancer Institute, The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) , Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a sole source modification for a one year extension to the contract with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), of Manassas, Virginia, to continue providing support services for investigations related to the processing of fresh and frozen biospecimens for the purpose of conducting studies on the etiology of cancer.</p>
<p>The American Type Culture Collection has been under contract (No. N02-CP-31004) to the National Cancer Institute since 2003, to support studies in which the contractor has received and processed various human biospecimens so that their derivatives may be used in genetic and other metabolic analyses.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. American Type Culture Collection is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The ATCC has provided processing, and storage of these valuable specimens accumulated in this collection since 2003. The contractor has the established infrastructure and staff to accommodate the receipt and processing of samples within as little as 3-4 hours and up to 24 hours; thereby, making the ATCC, uniquely qualified by virtue of their continued performance, and the only one responsible source.</p>
<p>If this effort were to be awarded to another contractor it would take approximately two (2) of months for another contractor to establish the necessary infrastructure and specialized staffing necessary to fulfill the government's requirements. This would result in unnecessary delays and the destruction of the ongoing collection and processing of the valuable specimen collection that has been ongoing since 2003. This would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The purpose of extending this contract is to complete the following active studies:</p>
<p>1) Continuity in the transformation of lymphocytes collected in the Urban Health Study with the Eptstein Barr Virus (EBV) in order to provide unlimited quantities of DNA for studies of hepatitis C virus and other viruses that cause cancer.<br />2) Receipt of blood and buccal specimens from studies of familial cancer conducted through the Familial Cancer Omnibus Protocol (78-C-0039), the Melanoma clinical studies protocol (02-C-0211), the clinical studies for blood and lymph node cancers protocol (02-C-0210), the chordoma protocol, the Italian and American melanoma case-control and family studies protocols, and the Family Testicular Cancer study to include EBV transformation of lymphocytes, cryopreservation, nucleic acid extraction and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).<br />3) Receipt, processing and viable cryopreservation of bone marrow samples from persons with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) to be followed by extraction of DNA and RNA for in vitro function studies designed to evaluate the functional consequences of newly-identified mutations in IBMFS-related genes, and to conduct studies of induced pluirpotent stem cells, with multiple intra- and extra-mural laboratory investigators. Whole blood will be extracted for DNA to allow for studies of dyskeratosis congenital, Fanconi anemia and other IBMFS. This study also supports the culturing of skin fibroblasts and subsequent DNA extraction for the evaluation of germline mosaicism in IBMFS patients who do not meet standard molecular diagnostic criteria.<br />4) Whole blood will be received from the Family Testicular Family study and processed into PBMCs that will be used for high-resolution cytogenetic studies aimed at identifying candidate genomic loci which might harbor TGCT susceptibility loci and to isolate DNA for the purpose of identifying rare, highly penetrant testicular cancer susceptibility genes. <br />5) PBMC isolation, cryopreservation, EBV transformation, and nucleic acid extraction will also be performed for the Pleural Pulmonary Blastoma Study, the Li-Fraumeni Study and the Nurofibromatosis Type 1 study.<br />As part of the work under this potential contract quarterly and final technical report are expected.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to continue with one source under authority FAR 6.302. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability must respond by submitting a capability statement (5 page limit) within 15 days of publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Overnight deliveries should be mailed to Juana A. Diaz at the National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Suite 600, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email at diazj@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole souce contract and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with SHEINBERG ASSOCIATES, 204 N FRANKLIN ST, JUNEAU, AK 99801-1225, a small business concern, to provide Facilitation Services to Glacier Bay National Park.  Steinberg Associates has previous experience working on this type of specific scientific meeting.  Please see the below Justification for Other than Full and Open Competiiton for further details.
This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.  This service will be procured under Firm Fixed Price Services in accordance with FAR procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1.  The anticipated award date is 12 April 2011.  Point of contact for this acquisition is Bernard Pitts, 907-644-3308, or Bernard_Pitts@nps.gov.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND:Since even before its establishment in 1925, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (GLBA) has maintained a long and storied tradition of hosting scientific research.  Its enabling Proclamation and subsequent legislation and management policies and guidance have all explicitly recognized the park's inherent values to science, principally owing to the character of its young, dynamic, and actively developing ecosystems, its record of landscape history, and the relatively pristine condition of resources mostly buffered from anthropogenic impacts.  The park encompasses a suite of world-class natural and cultural resources even as it perpetually faces a variety of challenging management issues associated with protecting those resources while providing for public enjoyment.GLBA's "research opportunity value", then - both to substantially contribute to science in general as well as to provide information to assist management in addressing pressing management problems - is exceeding high.  Ironically, the park has never formally developed a comprehensive research plan which identifies and prioritizes its full range of scientific needs and opportunities.  This is a task necessary to effectively and efficiently allocate limited resources (funds, energy, time) to resolve important issues by informing science-based decision-making.  Such a task will also optimally organize the park's approach to encouraging and supporting research efforts that can best contribute to scientific knowledge in general.Consequently, the GLBA Resource Management staff has embarked upon a process to identify and prioritize scientific information needs that will guide park management and external researchers in intelligently investing research effort over the coming decades.  As a central and initial step, the Resource Management staff will actively develop its knowledge to create the core of a Research Plan.  To facilitate full and open communication among park staff, and to capture the results, a facilitated two-day workshop is being planned.The meeting will have two measurable outcomes.  First, the meeting format will ensure robust and focused communication among park resource managers.  These managers are uniquely qualified to identify not only the important management issues, but also the research approaches that will address the information gaps to ensure knowledge-based decisions-making.  Similarly, they are intimately familiar with the potential for park resources to frame research that will contribute to scientific knowledge in general.  Secondly, the meeting results and recommendations must be captured in a formal report - tailored to park managers - documenting research needs and priorities.  This report will ultimately guide the park's future research agenda, and it will serve as the primary and essential product of the workshop.This workshop needs to be directed by a skilled professional facilitator who is intimately familiar with earlier, less-comprehensive and more focused internal park efforts to organize its scientific knowledge (particularly re. identifying information gaps).  In addition, the facilitator must have a deep understanding of GLBA park management goals, as well as familiarity with park resources and management issues.  1)	FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:   Since 2004, Sheinberg Associates, 204 N. Franklin Street, Suite 1, Juneau, Alaska 99801 have facilitated several meetings of the NPS Southeast Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network of parks, of which GLBA is a dominant member.  Subsequent to those meetings Sheinberg Associates produced major programmatic documents detailing both the natural resources and the scientific research legacy and prospects of GLBA.  These products include Freshwater Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2005), Marine Ecosystems Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2006), Terrestrial Ecosystems Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2006), and Vital Signs Selection Historical Documentation: Southeast Alaska Network (2007).  Similarly, Sheinberg Associates have facilitated every meeting of the Glacier Bay Science Advisory Board (a group charged with identifying and prioritizing research needs related to evaluating potential resource impacts by cruise ships) since its inception in 2004, and have helped write The Glacier Bay National Park Science Advisory Board: Final Report for Research and Monitoring Needs Relevant to Decisions Regarding Increasing Seasonal Use Days for Cruise Ships in Glacier Bay (2005); the follow-up Glacier Bay Science Advisory Board Recommendations Regarding Prioritization of Research and Monitoring Needs Relevant to Decisions Regarding Increasing Seasonal Use Days for Cruise Ships in Glacier Bay (2006); and the Proceedings of the SAB-hosted 2009 Cruise Ship Science Meeting to present research results to date (2010).  This contractor has intimate familiarity with the natural resources, scientific research processes, and associated technical terminology that will be used throughout the workshop.  They also are familiar with the park's scientific history as well as its management issues, and they have worked closely with many of the workshop participants.  Indeed, Sheinberg Associates planned, facilitated, and reported on the 2010 Research Priorities Workshop, the original meeting that the upcoming 2011 meeting follows on from.  If Sheinberg Associates were not used for facilitation there would be substantial duplication of the cost to the Government (as stated in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)) in that a new vendor would have to closely review all of the documents and efforts of park staff and the Science Advisory Board in order to fully understand the purpose and the expected product (and critical supporting background information) that Sheinberg Associates already is very familiar with.  The quality of this workshop and its products will be a direct reflection of the effectiveness of the facilitator during and immediately following the meeting.    	2)	Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: Facilitated Research Agenda Workshop and resulting summary report (see attached statement of work).
3)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e., unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):   The Research Agenda Workshop, slated for April 2011, will reflect the cumulative actions and knowledge of key resource staff, particularly those of the past decade.  Sheinberg Associates have facilitated several of the seminal meetings (including every Science Advisory Board meeting since its inception in 2005) and helped write many of the formal summary reports upon which this workshop's process and outcomes will be based.  Because of their experience and close association with like GLBA processes in the recent past, Sheinberg Associates have the skills and expertise to very efficiently assist park staff with historical and contextual issues that will likely arise during the workshop.  Sheinberg associates planned, facilitated, and reported on the 2010 Research Priorities Workshop, the original meeting that the upcoming 2011 meeting follows on from.
4)	A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:   In many ways the upcoming workshop will represent and be based upon an accumulation of those meetings and resulting reports that have occurred since 2004, virtually all of which have been facilitated by Sheinberg Associates.  We are not aware of another vendor who can bring to bear a similar amount and combination of knowledge and expertise.  Given their previous seven years of experience with GLBA and that this meeting represents an accumulation of those efforts, Sheinberg Associates is the only facilitator with the knowledge to efficiently support park staff  in achieving the outcomes desired from the workshop.  
5)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  

6)	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:   There has been only one vendor, Sheinberg Associates, who has participated in activities related to natural resource ecological synthesis and scientific research analysis, including meeting facilitation and report production.  No other facilitator has this ability to combine knowledge of park resources and processes, the history of research, park management issues, and park management goals - all in context - to effectively and efficiently facilitate a workshop like this and produce a report that builds on the previous efforts.

<DESC>AMENDMENT- Posting of QUESTION & ANSWERS for all interested is vendors:<br><br>QUESTION:  How many different options can we submit for the hotel selection?  <br>RESPONSE:  There is no limit.  Just make sure they address the requirements of the synopsis/solicitation.<br><br>QUESTION:  Can another hotel host guest at a per diem rate.  For example, can one hotel guarantee 100 rooms at a per diem rate and another hotel host the other 50?<br>RESPONSE:  It is highly recommended that all conference attendees be co-located at the same hotel.  We will review all options but it is not the required state.<br><br>QUESTION:  Is there any one particular chain that should not be used? <br>RESPONSE:  Our primary concern is the health, safety and security of the conference participants.  No hotel chain is excluded.  <br><br>QUESTION:  Is there any measurement that the projector or screen should be?<br>RESPONSE:  Exact measurements are not known.  The only requirement is that the conference participants be able to see what is being presented on screen.  Understanding that 200 people seated in a classroom style room, may not allow the smallest data to be read by the people sitting the farthest away from the screen.  Perhaps, a minimum size of 15' x 15' can be considered.  However, it really depends on how the room (chairs and tables) is configured.<br><br>QUESSTION:  Is the group requesting 150 rooms on May 23 and May 24 and May 25?  Or just May 24 & May 25 with a few rooms on May 23?<br>Response:   150 rooms are required on 23 May - 25 May.  Please note that this number may fluctuate--all conference attendees may not check-in on the 23rd/depending on travel arrangement.  The conference ends at noon on 26 May; therefore, an estimated 50 rooms may be required for those individuals who's travel plans may not allow them to leave on the 26th.<br><br>QUESTION:  In regards to the breakouts, were you going to need roving microphone for the breakouts? <br>RESPONSE:  The roving microphones are primarily needed for the main (large) conference room; however, they may also be utilized in the breakout rooms if needed.<br><br>QUESTION:  How many flip charts did you need for the breakouts?<br>RESPONSE:  The flipcharts - 2 in the main conference room and 1 in each breakout room.  This may also change if the flipcharts are not being used in the main conference area. <br><br>QUESTION:  Does the group require 150 guestrooms per night starting on May 23 or May 24?  <br>RESPONSE:  Yes both nights.<br><br>QUESTION:  Meeting space is needed 8a-5p on May 24, 25 and 26?<br>RESPONSE:  Space Requirement May 24-25 (8:00 - 5:00); May 26 (8:00 - 12:00)<br><br>QUESTION:  Can one of the breakout rooms be the general session room? <br>RESPONSE:  No, the General Session Room will be used as a Breakout Room as needed.  A total of 3-Rooms are required (1-room to accommodate 200 individuals and 2-rooms to accommodate 50-70 individuals).<br><br>QUESTION:  What is the set-up for the breakout rooms?<br>RESPONSE:  All Rooms should be set up in classroom-style layout with no more than five people per 8' table.<br><br>Conference Location is Chicago, IL.  Reference ADENDUM 52-212-2, Paragraph 3.<br><br>ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.  The CLOSING DATE IS NOT CHANGED.<br>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers IAW FAR 13.106-2-Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br /><br /><strong>Price-<br /></strong>(1) The Government will evaluate offers for award based on the realism and reasonableness of total price proposed for the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best price, terms, and conditions.</p>
<p>(3) Realism-Offerors are advised that unrealistically proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offer does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Realism accesses whether the proposed price is compatible with the proposal scope of effort and the requirements of solicitation.</p>
<p>(4) Reasonable is defined as a price that provides best value to the Government when considering current market prices, wage determinations included in the solicitation and technical capabilities of the offerors. Also, a fair price should ensure the offer a reasonable profit commensurate with performance.</p>
<p><strong>Technical-<br /></strong>The proposal will be determined technically acceptable if quote is composed of the items listed in the SOW. If an equal is being proposed, please provide the specifications for any items that are substituted. Clearly indicated the substitutions.</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance-<br /></strong>Submit at least two (2) contracts performed in the last three to five years, comparable in value and requirements. Include name of company/agency, contract number, point of contact (name and phone number), and total dollar value.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be given an overall general assessment risk rating. Performance risk relates to the assessment of an offeror's present and past work record to assess confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements.</p>
<p><br />The following definitions will be used in assessing performance risks:</p>
<p><strong>High</strong>-Significant doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong> - Some doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong> - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's performance record that the offeror can perform the proposed efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong> - No significant performance record is identifiable.</p>
<p>Past performance is equal to price. Offer must be found technically acceptable.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities (Apr 1984),<br /><br />FAR 52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions (Oct 2010),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Recycled Paper (Aug 2000),<br /><br />FAR 52.204-6, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number (Apr 2008), If a copy of the provisions are needed, the can be found on arnet.gov/far,<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999),<br /><br />Each offeror shall complete paragraphs (c) through (o) of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2011) if offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES</p>
<p>Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:<br />a. First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.<br />b. Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.<br />c. Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time.<br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:<br />i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.<br />(Note:) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>
<p><br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS <br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DOD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DOD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p><br />Services:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor needs to provide a minimum of a 10 year warranty on all parts that are being installed. The contractor shall have a service location site within a 50 mile radius of NMCP to be able to respond on-site within 2 hours of an initial service call if warranty work is required. Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) blue plenum rated twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing junction boxes (must properly drilled and sleeved so box can be closed and secured after installation), conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI /TIA/EIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/TIA/EIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with blue RJ-45 angled modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel (with blue modular jacks) if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton with blue Cat6 jacks) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to TIA/EIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a representative from the Network Team. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed. The removed cabling list will be provided to the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389). If cabling was removed through a firewall, all fire stopping must be replaced or filled-in in accordance National Electric Code (NEC).</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Contractor will provide site with complete test documentation as well as a cable running list (Appendix A). The cable running list will include building number, floor number, room number, drop number and drop location. Drop location is explained in Appendix B. If cable removal is applicable, vendor must provide a list of all data drop numbers removed to include room number it was removed from. (Appendix A). Contractor will also provide 2 CAT6 patch cables for each data drop installed. The cable at the patch panel will be 5ft in length and the other will be 15ft in length (the patch cables will be delivered to the Networking Office Bldg. 249 room 127).</p>
<p>**DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST ATTEND A "WALK THROUGH" TO EXAMINE WORK CONDITIONS AND EXISTING EQUIPMENT. BIDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FROM CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT ATTEND THE WALK THROUGH.**</p>

<DESC><p>The Babel Program will develop agile and robust speech recognition technology that can be rapidly applied to any human language in order to provide effective search capability for analysts to efficiently process massive amounts of real-world recorded speech. Today's transcription systems are built on technology that was originally developed for English, with markedly lower performance on non-English languages. These systems have often taken years to develop and cover only a small subset of the languages of the world. Babel intends to demonstrate the ability to generate a speech transcription system for any new language within one week to support keyword search performance for effective triage of massive amounts of speech recorded in challenging real-world situations.</p>

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotation will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage services and menu options, lodging, and secured storage. Quotation must address the quoter's ability to comply with the ADA, as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotation should reflect the quality of services provided and maintained. (b) Location. Quotation will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the downtown Chicago,&nbsp;Illinois area with adequate low cost or free parking for attendees, with multiple local transportation options that are cost effective for the government travelers. The facility has a variety of restaurants and other attractions within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. (c) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability to provide the required services on the dates requested. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc). A quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available; the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for all breaks and reception, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification, apply to this acquisition.

(2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number).

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br /></strong>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager will support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities. OTI currently has four regional teams: Asia and Middle East (AME), Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). It is expected that the Senior Program Manager will provide initial assistance to DCHA/OTI's Asia and Middle East (AME) team in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, DCHA/OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Senior Program Manager will be based in Washington, D.C. as a member of one of DCHA/OTI's regional program teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD). Regional teams are responsible for all program-related activity in the region. The incumbent will report to and be supervised by one of the FPD Regional Team Leaders (initially the AME Team Leader). The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Support of implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for up to 3 months if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, Department of State and other USG agencies and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1)__Are,__are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3)__Are,__are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4)__Have,__have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)<br />(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity- a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). Conflict of Interest Certification The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest). <br />Offeror's Name ___________________________________________________ <br />RFP/Contract No. _________________________________________________ <br />Signature ________________________________________________________ <br />Title ____________________________________________________________ <br />Date ____________________________________________________________ <br /><br /><br />310-16 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)<br />The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract. The contractor further certifies that it did not utilize the services of such an ED employee in assisting or representing the offeror at negotiations for this contract.</p>

<p>314-1 PAST PERFORMANCE REPORT (MAR 1996)<br />Each offeror shall submit the following information as a separately bound part of its proposal for both the offeror and proposed major subcontractors. Major, regarding past performance, is any subcontractor that is subcontracted for a minimum of 25% of the total contract amount. Each major subcontractor shall identify the name of the prime contractor on each of its past performance forms. If the offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. <br />A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. If the offeror's last four similar contracts are all currently in process, submit the last three similar contracts currently in process, and the most recent similar contract completed within the last three years. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. Contracts with the parent or an affiliate of the offeror may not be used. Include the following information for each contract and subcontract: 1. Identification a. Name of the contracting activity b. Program title or product name c. Contract number d. Contract type e. Period of performance, including all option periods f.

Paragraph E. below requires you to send a copy of the "Contractor Information Form" to each of your references. In your past performance report, include: a. The date you sent the "Contractor Information Form" to each reference. b. How you sent it (e.g., fax, mail, express delivery service, courier, e-mail, etc.). c. To whom you sent it including telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known). <br />B. The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in A above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Other than the information requested in A above, offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references. <br />C. Offerors should understand the difference between experience and past performance. Experience reflects the offeror's capability of performing a requirement. Past performance reflects how well it has performed similar requirements. In assessing past performance, the quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. <br />D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required.

Identify which segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Information about awards will be considered in evaluation of each of the past performance subfactors described in "Evaluation Criteria." The offeror may describe how the award relates to one or more of the subfactors. <br />E. No later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation, send a copy to each of your four references of the "Contractor Performance Information" form attached to this solicitation. Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. <br />F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Past Performance" form identified in Attachment D will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.<br />311-6 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS (APRIL 1998)<br />Offerors must submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist.

<DESC><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK8"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK11">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is issuing solicitation number HQ0236-11-T-0006 as a request for&nbsp;quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.<br /><br />The Period of Performance for this requirement is 01 JUN 2011 through 31 MAY 2012 for the base period plus four one-year option periods encompassing the four year period from 01 JUN 2012 through 31 MAY 2016.<br /><br />The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK8"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK11">This requirement is being solicited using FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items/Services. The purpose of this test program is to vest Contracting Officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial item acquisitions greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $6.5 million may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs for both the Government and industry. As such, the Contracting Officer will perform an initial price reasonableness screening of all quotes. If a quoted price is so high or so low or otherwise so dificient that the Contracting Officer determines the firm has no reasonable chance of award, the Government reserves the right to conduct no further evaluation of the quote. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies (GMCM) is an international educational institution funded by the United States Department of Defense and the German Ministry of Defense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its mission is to create a more stable security environment by advancing democratic defense institutions and relationships; promoting active, peaceful engagement; and enhancing enduring partnerships between the nations of America, Europe and Eurasia.<br /></span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK8"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK11"><br />The GCMC <span style="COLOR: black">maintains an Unclassified computer network.

The resulting contract shall be flexible and easily customized at the Task Order level to construct solutions and applicable CLIN structures suitable for all current GCMC IT &amp; IM support services requirements as well as those that may evolve and/or emerge during the life of the contract. The primary metrics used to measure mission performance are on-site inspections and customer feedback.</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK8"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK11"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART A - PRICE SCHEDULE </span></span>

The following evaluation factors/criteria shall be evaluated by the Government: <br /><br />Volume I- Technical (non-cost) Factors- The technical factors are all of equal importance. <br /><br />Factor 1- Technical Approach <br />Factor 2- Quality Control<br /><br />Volume II- Cost or Price Factors<br />Factor - Price <br /><br /><em>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH </em><br />The offeror technical approach shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements and provide the techniques and procedures that will be used to satisfy the requirements in a timely and cost effective manner. The Offeror's technical approach will be evaluated by assessing the likelihood that the proposed technical approach will meet the Government's requirements, including any associated risk of the Offeror's non-performance in the technical approach. This factor will be used to evaluate the degree to which the Offeror's proposed technical approach meets all requirements. Offerors shall demonstrate their understanding of the requirements stated in the PWS. Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the Offeror concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested as measured by the following which are considered of equal importance:<br />&bull; Understanding of the technical requirements identified in the PWS.<br />&bull; Detailed approach for providing for the technical requirements identified in the PWS.<br />&bull; A demonstration of the technical approach to be used to ensure the work is being performed on-time and properly.</p>
<p><em>FACTOR 2: QUALITY CONTROL PLAN</em>. <br />The Offeror shall provide a Quality Control Plan (QCP) which clearly states the proposed methods and techniques that will be used to maintain effectiveness of the Offeror's quality control system through the use of their quality policies, quality objectives and analysis of data, corrective action plans, preventative actions, and management review. The plan shall, at a minimum, discuss the Offeror's overall approach and procedures for evaluating each of the tasks identified in the PWS, communicating with the Government, resolving deficiencies, and identifying potential improvements. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror clearly states the proposed methods and techniques that will be used to maintain effectiveness of the Offeror's quality control system through the use of their quality policies, quality objectives and analysis of data, corrective action plans, preventative actions, and management review. <br /><br /><em>FACTOR: PRICE<br /></em>Offeror shall provide fixed unit prices for each CLIN for the basic requirement and option periods identified in Attachment B, Price/Cost Schedule. Offerors shall propose a fully burdened fixed hourly rate for CLIN 0004, 10004, 2004.. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options does not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the CLIN&nbsp;prices and/or&nbsp;option prices are significantly unbalanced. The Government will evaluate the price proposal to determine reasonableness of price offered. Wage Determination Number 2005-2231 Revision No. 11 dated 07/27/2010 for East Baton Rouge Parish shall be applicable to the resulting contract/purchase order.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.  You must also be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.  The ORCA website is located at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <br><br>Contractors submitting an offer as a joint venture must provide a written copy of the joint venture agreement with the initial proposal. The joint venture agreement must be signed by all parties and will be subject to review by Office of Counsel. If an 8(a) small business joint venture is contemplated, approval by the Small Business Administration will be required and the joint venture agreement must comply with the applicable requirements of 13 CFR Part 124.  The joint venture must be registered in CCR as a joint venture in order for an award to be made. In addition, all documents and future documents (task orders, etc.) must be signed by all parties.<br><br>Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting which states in part: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.<br><br><br>2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services will include core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations. Use of automatic hammers and strict adherence to calibration requirements will be required. Use of manual hammers with appropriate calibration will be accepted by exception only and must be approved in advance. Maximum possible recovery of sampled materials is mandatory.

<DESC>Type of Notification:   Request for Proposal (RFP) for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
NOTE - THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  DOE will only accept proposals from small businesses that do not exceed the small business size standard of $25.5M in average annual receipts under NAICS code 484230 "Specialized Freight (except used goods) Trucking, Long-Distance."
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is procuring the continuation of carrier services for the award of a contract or contracts for the transport of contact-handled (CH) and remote-handled (RH) transuranic (TRU) wastes and mixed hazardous constituents, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos between various DOE sites across the country and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico.   
The transport of TRU waste is accomplished by contract carriers that transport the waste via public highways on custom designed trailers in Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved packages.  The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract using firm-fixed- price delivery task orders over a five-year contract period, consisting of a one year base ordering period and four additional one-year option ordering periods.  
This procurement will replace two existing carrier contracts that will expire March 2012 and September 2012, respectively.  Two contracts are anticipated to be awarded by March 2012. The carriers are responsible for transitioning the work from the current carrier contractors without interruption, and maintaining the WIPP disposal schedule.
Contractor proposals are requested by May 17, 2011.  THE RFP CAN BE FOUND AT: www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php
Interested parties are encouraged to view the website at www.emcbc.doe.gov/WIPP/index.php regularly for information about this procurement as it will be the primary conduit with which to provide such information.

The lack of ability to access medical image data across separate organizations results in significant problems: inadequate patient service due to absent data, delayed service due to ineffective image distribution solutions (film, CD, etc.), technology hurdles, and significant increases in cost and potential health risk due to duplicate image acquisition.<br /><br />Sharing image data through electronic health records (EHRs) through a network for image exchange will lead to better informed medical decisions, better analysis of medical outcomes, reductions in unnecessary expenses and improvements in the quality and safety of patient care. The value of patient care will improve, if systems at different locations are capable of managing, exchanging, and displaying medical information in its many forms, including images. Existing network infrastructure and technologies have great potential to solve the image sharing problem. In addition, an optimal solution could dramatically reduce overhead on the health care infrastructure.<br /><br />To this end, NIBIB has funded several endeavors over the last few years to establish basic infrastructures to promote the exchange of medical images across broad geographic areas within the United States. Several foundations have been identified in previous efforts for successful image sharing system, e.g. security, identity, privacy and confidentiality, consent and permissions, bandwidth, ease of use, etc.<br /><br />Today we have a limited set of solutions enabling interoperability of clinical information and image data. Patients and physicians need a better way to inform and access existing image exams and results with appropriate utilization. There is a need to develop and extend image sharing systems in the context of health information exchange and "meaningful use" of EHR.<br />There is a need for some standardization and common mechanisms to move data throughout our healthcare system. While the intent is not to stifle innovation, some underlying first principles of exchange can in fact foster innovation, by providing developers with a common reference framework upon which to deploy novel solutions.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this contract is to develop a patient-centered and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing system where patients can directly visualize and control their images for effective and safe image sharing among radiologists and clinicians with broad participation from a large number of academic institutions, professional societies, and industry vendors.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements<br /></span><br />To be able to qualify for this contract, offerors must demonstrate that they have already institutionalized, at their respective institute, a sound medical image sharing system with which patients can control how and when they want to share their medical images. The image sharing system must be readily extended to meet the technical requirements. The offerors must also demonstrate, by themselves or by collaboration, the ability to include extremely broad expertise, such as medical imagers, radiologists, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists. The offerors must also demonstrate the capability of collaboration with a large number of academic institutions, industries that provide multiple imaging modalities and EHR solutions. Finally, the offerors must provide plans and measures to ensure that that the solution they developed under this contract will be readily disseminated and adopted by industry partners who have an EHR system in clinical use. In another word, NIBIB requires the offerors clearly define the sustainably model and pave the clear path for the successful translation of the developed image sharing system into clinical practice. <br /><br />&bull; Develop use cases for the extension of the existing institutionalized image sharing system. The use case must be based on real world scenarios of image examination workflow in health care environment and research environment and must address unmet needs or technical challenges. <br /><br />&bull; Implement the extension of the image sharing use cases based on the existing institutionalized image sharing system. <br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate consumer based control and ownership of their imaging exams through integration of Personal Health Records (PHRs) with the above system in a secure fashion, recognizing HIPAA requirements.<br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate that internet based imaging exchange is an extensible model in multiple venues, including the numerous venues of standard clinical care as well as in the research environment.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to provide reference framework and metadata for data mining, quality assurance (QA), and structured reporting capability toward future "meaningful use" of image in EHR.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to provide reference framework for comparative effectiveness analysis based on clinical indications and outcomes for providing better clinical decision support. <br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate that the offerors possess quality clinical and image data in their existing institutionalized system that can be leveraged, consolidated, integrated, aggregated, and de-identified for data mining, comparative effectiveness analysis and clinical decision support. <br /><br />&bull; Leverage the radiology ontologies, standard vocabularies, and structured radiology report whenever possible and appropriate.<br /><br />&bull; Develop partnership with industry and the community to facilitate the adoption of the solution as a reference for interoperability by industry and the community.<br /><br />&bull; Explore economic model and financial rewards scheme of image exchange to develop a sustainability model using the data generated from this contract or similar projects.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to resolve remain issues in policy, safety, and security to enable the secure but transparent exchange of imaging exams throughout the healthcare systems into the rapidly emerging solutions that patients will be leveraging.<br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate novel approaches to allow patient-controlled and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing networks.<br /><br />&bull; Develop flexible end user preferences and permissions for patients easily to control the when, who, and what to sharing. Patients should be able to select individual images or report for sharing. Patient should also be able to cancel the permission or put a time limit on a shared image.
<p><br />At the end of the project, an evaluation of the patient-controlled medical image sharing system shall be conducted for:<br /><br />&bull; The reduction of the time and the cost for sharing and transferring longitudinal record among regional networks<br /><br />&bull; The reduction of the time and the cost for selecting images and export them to clinical study<br /><br />&bull; The efficiency and security of patient-controlled image sharing<br /><br />&bull; The benefits of such a patient-controlled medical image sharing network to patients, physicians and researchers</p>

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a (5) month term extension to contract EP-D-06-001 with E.H. Pechan &amp; Associates, Inc on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". Since 2005, Pechan has provided support to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) for services in support of program review and tracking. During this period of time, Pechan has provided support for cost, benefits, and economic analyses, as well as regulatory impacts and quality management for major office or air rule makings. Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court ordered deadlines, which is critical to the Agency's mission.
<p>Currently, Option Period IV of contract EP-D-06-001 expires on April 30, 2011. A follow-on competitive procurement is in process, however, it will not be awarded before contract EP-D-06-001 expires. It is essential that court ordered deadlines in support of NAAQS, NSPS and NESHAP projects be met. Missing deadlines will result in a delay in completing standards which would increase the public's exposure to harmful toxic air pollutants. The proposed extension of this contract is to provide program review and tracking which includes the comprehensive evaluation of the air quality data and type of progress states are making toward meeting the NAAQS . Only Pechan, through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires. A critically important fact is that the activities within these source categories are under court ordered deadlines and involved in litigation, which requires the Agency to proceed with the work in progress without interruption.</p>
<p>No request for proposal is available and this notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform this effort within the time frames required by the Agency must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: US EPA, ATTN: Natalia Fisher Jackson, RTP Procurement Operations Division, MD 105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the above mentioned five (5) month term extension of contract EP-D-06-001 with E.H. Pechan and Associates, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The SEC has a sole source requirement to obtain through a short term extension approximately 147,000 rentable square feet (rsf) of headquarters office space in the Washington, D.C. area, to continue housing business and information technology operations that are currently being housed and performed on site at 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria VA (&ldquo;Ops Center&rdquo;). The current SEC lease at the Ops Center expires October 31, 2011. The extension will be for a three year term with cancellation rights after two years. This requirement arose as a result of budget changes and uncertainties that have forced the SEC to reevaluate earlier space acquisition planning. In July 2010, the SEC entered into a lease for approximately 900,000 rsf of office space at Constitution Center (&ldquo;CC&rdquo;) located in Southwest Washington D.C., for a 10-year term to be delivered in phases commencing in Fall 2011. This space was obtained following expanded SEC responsibilities and increased appropriations and budget authorizations from the Dodd-Frank Act and other Congressional and budget planning actions. Congress has not yet adopted an appropriation for the SEC for FY 2011. An SEC request to Congress for anomaly funding above FY 2010 levels to allow fulfillment of prior Congressional plans was rejected. As a result, the agency is currently funded under a continuing resolution that authorizes the agency to operate at last fiscal year&rsquo;s funding levels. These funding constraints have prompted the SEC to implement substantial cuts in its operating budget. Much of the hiring planned out of the agency&rsquo;s FY 2010 funding was halted due to the budget uncertainties and retractions as the agency entered FY 2011 without funding in place to support its annualized costs, and FY 2011 hiring has been severely restricted. In Fall 2010, as a result of these funding constraints, the SEC released rights to most of its space in CC, which was in turn leased by the landlord to other Federal agencies. At that time, the SEC contemplated retaining rights to 300,000 rsf in CC to, among other things, potentially house the Virginia requirement located in the Ops Center and the satellite Shawnee facility. The SEC conducted a cost benefit analysis that determined that the rent difference between CC and the Ops Center could be offset by, among other things, the reduced shuttle costs and increased work efficiencies that could be realized by eliminating the Virginia location. Moving the Ops Center to CC would also be in keeping with the President&rsquo;s June 4, 2010 Memorandum directing agencies to consolidate locations where cost effective. The budget uncertainties prompting the SEC to seek to release its space in CC have still not been resolved. The current continuing resolution expires on March 4, 2011. Moving the Ops Center requirement into CC, as previously contemplated, would require the SEC to remain firmly committed to the CC space for the 10-year term of the lease. The SEC has determined that the uncertainty of its budget and its space and hiring needs on a long term basis counsel against retaining any continuing long term presence at CC, and that the SEC should seek an alternative resolution for any remaining long term SEC space rights in CC. Further, additional office space that has become available through attrition at the SEC&rsquo;s Station Place headquarters has enabled us to consolidate approximately 200 of the Virginia employees and contractors into Station Place. This strategy will allow the SEC to consolidate staff from the Shawnee Road satellite office to the Ops Center, enable the SEC to terminate that short term lease, and realize savings by reducing costs associated with the space and associated operating costs. This consolidation has reduced the amount of space that would be needed for consolidation at CC, and has already achieved much of the efficiency that would have been obtained by consolidation at CC. In these circumstances, the SEC has determined that a short-term extension of the Ops Center lease to allow the SEC to obtain more certainty as to its long-term budget and space needs would be in the agency&rsquo;s current best interest.
