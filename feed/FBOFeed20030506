<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2002-09. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-01-03-RP-72184 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service is responsible for oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (OCSLA), and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). OCSLA and NEPA require assessment of the effects of OCS oil and gas activities on adjacent human and physical environments.  To this end MMS acquires and analyzes and/or oversees collection and analysis of environmental, socioeconomic, and socio-cultural information relevant to OCS-related decisions and utilizes that information in Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS).  MMS social scientist must predict impacts from possible oil spills stemming from the five-year program, specific lease sales as well as cumulative effects.  These estimates are done in part by using past oil spill events as case studies.  Potential effects are then extrapolated to other locations in Alaska, the Pacific region and the Gulf of Mexico.    Since major oil spills are rare, few case studies actually exist in the United States.  This effort considers oil spill events both in the United States as well as abroad.  Various methods have been used to estimate impacts of these events.  This study provides essential pieces of documentation that will allow EIS writers to take directly from the information provided in this report and apply it in a comparative fashion to possible spill event effects related to OCS activity, including platforms, pipelines as well as tankers. STUDY OBJECTIVES.  Identify the spectrum of documented effects, such as income lost, number of wildlife dead, miles of coastline spoiled, fishing disturbances, demographic shifts, recreation and tourism, hotel/motel and restaurant industry, environmental justice, socio-cultural systems and infrastructure demands. In addition, other not so easily measurable effects should be included such as long-term cumulative change, ecosystem and natural resource impacts, and changes in the minds and lives of people who experience the spill.  Therefore, literature is sought that deals with both the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of the impacts people and places experience during and after such an event.  The documented effects should be categorized separately into effects sections to allow EIS writers to directly extract information pertaining to a particular effect without going to the originals works.  First, the contractor shall review all relevant literature on oil spills around the world and describe effects of these events.  The documented effects will provide a useful basis for MMS analyst to compare and predict potential oil spill impacts from OCS activity in EIS writing.  Second, the contractor shall conduct a content analysis of relevant information from media outlets such as newspaper, television, radio, magazines, etc. to inform MMS social scientists from the perspective of the social construction of the event.  The findings will then be incorporated into the final report along with the review of literature. While documented literature will offer insight into the social and economic impacts of major oil spills, how people construct environmental information becomes the basis for contesting claims as to basic rights, responsibilities and responses to technological disasters.  All aspects of the assemblage of claims should be examined from a social constructionist's perspective. SCOPE OF WORK - A.  General Program Scheduling - This study shall have a maximum of a 12 month period of performance following the date of contract award. Location.  The study will focus on areas where major oil spill events have occurred throughout the U.S. and the world.  Locations for analysis will be discussed and agreed upon with the COTR before any effort is made or funds expended.

<DESC>Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineering Services for Renovation of  Building 505, San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge - Provide multi-discipline Architect-Engineer services for planning and design of the renovation of an existing building, site design to establish vehicular traffic patterns, and vehicle parking.  The project includes demolition of existing partitions, ceilings, and electrical, mechanical, and other systems throughout the 20,140 square feet building, renovation of 6,800 +/- square feet for office and other supporting spaces, and basic renovation of the remaining 13,300 +/- square feet for future classroom, future exhibit area, and other future public use space.  No exhibitry or other public contact features will be designed or constructed under this project.  However, this design project will provide for future construction of these features and will include a minimum level of space planning for them.  The basic design services required include architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, telecommunications, site design, and fire protection.  Because the building is considered historic, some historical building design skills, knowledge, and experience are required.  However, this is not an historical restoration project.  The design shall meet LEED "Certified" criteria but actual certification from the US Green Building Council is not required.    The construction budget is approximately $2 million. Construction management assistance may be included at the government's option.  Some of those activities include material submittal reviews, response to Requests for Information from the construction contractor, periodic site visits during construction, conducting and attending periodic construction progress meetings, and attending certain pre-installation meetings with the construction contractor and its subcontractors.   Firms which possess the qualifications necessary to perform the contract work are invited to submit a completed, current SF 255 "Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project," and a completed current SF Form 254 Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire" for each of its proposed consultants.   Interested firms with more than one office must indicate on their SF 255 the staffing composition of the office in which the work will be performed.   Indicate project number in block 2b of the SF 255.  The completed SF 255 should indicate the specific personnel from the responding firm and all consultants expected to do the work on this contract, with resumes for each, professional registration by state, and experience in this type of work over the past five (5) years.  Submittals will be evaluated by a selection committee led by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, based on the following evaluation criteria, listed in order of importance.  (1) professional qualifications of the firms and individuals listed to perform this work including individual licenses and experience;  (2) past performance on public and private projects in terms of cost control, quality of completed design and construction documents, compliance with performance schedules, and responsiveness to issues raised during design and construction;  (3) location of the lead firm and consultants in the general geographic area of the project site and knowledge of local customs and criteria relating to building design and construction;  (4) demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered and recycled materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design;  (5) the team's capacity to take on this work and accomplish within the required time;  (6) specialized experience in renovation of historic structures.    When responding to this announcement firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the specific evaluation criteria.  The three top-ranked firms recommended for interview will be evaluated and recommended solely on their written responses to this announcement.       A firm, fixed-price contract will be negotiated for the planning and design phase of this project.  Separate negotiations will be conducted for construction assistance if that option is exercised by the Government.  The Government anticipates award of  this contract in August 2003.  Notice to Proceed is anticipated to be no sooner than November 3, 2003.    Performance time is 292 calendar days.   Building 505 is located near the intersection of Azuar Drive and "I" Street on Mare Island in Vallejo, Solano County, CA.  Interested A-E firms may visit the site anytime Monday thru Friday during normal business hours; however, access to the building interior cannot be assured.  To ensure interior access, schedule site visits at least one working day in advance with Christy Smith, Refuge Manager, at 707-562-3000 or email at "christy_smith@fws.gov".   The procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program and is open to both large and small business concerns.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  Interested firms should provide their submittal in an original and two copies.  Award of this contract and/or any options is contingent upon availability of funds.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Supply Service (FSS), Small Business Government Wide Contracts Center (SBGWACC), formerly the GSA, Federal Technology Service, Small Business Solutions Development Center, is pleased to announce the release of the draft RFP, 6FG-03-RAV-0001, for the 8(a) FAST 2 Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).  This second generation 8(a) FAST 2 GWAC is expected to build upon the achievements of its predecessor, and will incorporate lessons learned from our successful partnership with industry over the last 7 years.  One of the major changes from the first 8(a) FAST GWAC is an expansion of Functional Areas.  Whereas the early GWAC had one area, the new one will have 8  making it more robust.  This growth answers the clarion call from industry that we have heard voiced time after time over the last few years.

GSA is releasing this GWAC RFP, 6FG-03-RAV-0001, in draft form (the draft) to provide the business community an opportunity to review the proposed solicitation and to provide technical and business feedback to GSA on its content, format, clarity and any other relevant aspects.  All areas of the draft are subject to change based upon the responses/comments we receive.  We do believe the draft accurately reflects the basic requirements.

If you wish to comment on the draft, please tie your comment(s) to the specific part(s) and page(s) of the draft so we can better understand the relationship and meaning.  For comments to be considered in preparing the formal RFP, they must be received prior to the drafts closing date.  Comments shall only be received via e-mail to 8a@gsa.gov.  From time to time we may update this initial posting with additional details, including uploading/posting lists of significant questions asked and our responses thereto.  We wont be able to do that for every question.  It is hoped this early outreach to industry will result in an improved formal RFP process for all involved.

No offers/proposals are desired in response to the announcement of the draft.  The draft does not serve as a source of official guidance regarding the final contents of the anticipated formal RFP.  GSA expects to issue the formal RFP this summer (2003) with a 30-day proposal response period.

This posting of the draft on www.fedbizopps.gov shall be the exclusive means of distributing the draft  no other method will be employed.  The draft will close 4:30 p.m. CST June 6, 2003.  All questions and/or comments must be received prior to the closing date.

Many 8(a) firms have been in contact with this office from time to time and have asked to be alerted when this RFP moves ahead.  We will discharge our agreement to perform a courtesy notice to such parties in two ways.  First, we are sending out broadcast group e-mails to everyone on the courtesy contact list announcing the availability of the draft on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Second, in addition to the forthcoming separate announcement of the formal RFP, we will post a final notice in connection with this draft stating the availability of the formal RFP and its solicitation number.

Before asking any questions regarding the draft, we would request each of you to first read it from cover to cover to gain an integrated understanding of its entirety.  Weve found that, oftentimes, questions that spring to mind upon reading an early part of an RFP are usually addressed later in the document.

We will be unable to accept visits from industry during the draft and formal RFP periods.

The team responsible for the 8(a) FAST 2 GWAC program is truly excited about reaching this milestone, and looks forward to working in partnership with an expanded portfolio of 8(a) firms.

Please note:  Be sure to link through to all attached files associated with this 8(a) FAST 2 Draft Solicitation.

The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is not a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected to be greater than $500,000 in the first year of the contract. Therefore, there is no preferred offeror for this contract and all offers will be evaluated according to the terms set forth in the Prospectus.  Offers must be received by close of business at 4:00 p.m. on July 10, 2003. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors). There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number. All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). A Sources Sought Synopsis was released on 19 November 2002, with no amendments, under the project title Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA), Kirtland AFB NM. This announcement is to notify all interested parties that Det 8 Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking to award a small business set-aside contract for the upcoming NWCA effort and anticipates releasing a solicitation F29601-03-R-0001 on or about 9 January 2003 entitled Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA) Support. NWCA has primary technical and programmatic Air Force responsibility for Department of Defense (DoD) and National Nuclear Security Agency-Department of Energy (NNSA-DOE) nuclear weapon and counterproliferation activities. Activities include: (1) weapon effectiveness analysis, systems design and evaluations, and operational studies for counterforce strikes against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) and other asymmetric threats; (2) CBRNE target and intelligence assessments; (3) nuclear weapon modifications assessments, life extension assessments, system and component analysis, and management from operational deployment through retirement; (4) technical and programmatic oversight, technical interchange participation and documentation including summary reports of Nuclear Weapons Project Officers Groups (POGs). Nuclear weapon and counterproliferation solution concepts are developed and fielded through the USAF, DoD, and DOE acquisition processes to meet user requirements and ensure continued mission readiness, operation, and reliability certification throughout their lifetime.  Interaction between the USAF, DoD, and DOE agencies occurs through integrated product teams led by AF NWCA. To support this objective, NWCA is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed at the contractors facility and on-site at NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM: (A) program management, (B) engineering, (C) scientific, (D) computational, (E) analysis, (F) testing, (G) technical reporting/documentation, (H) targeting/intelligence, (I) office administration and (J) network administration.  The primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support NWCA programs such as nuclear stockpile sustainment and life extension; agent defeat weapons concept development; and targeting and collateral effects tools development and application. Due to possible office space constraints at NWCA, the effort may have to be performed off-base at the contractors facility. Therefore, the contractor facility must be located within a 50-mile radius of NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM. A draft RFP will not be issued for the acquisition; however, RFP attachments will be made available for viewing at the FedBizOpps website http://www.fedbizopps.gov prior to release of the RFP.  Offerors responding to this announcement are encouraged to monitor closely the website for potential changes to the acquisition. Offerors are also encouraged to register under the FedBizOpps Interested Vendors List (IVL). The list will allow vendors to register their interest in the solicitation and will be monitored and accessed by AFRL/PKVE personnel. Amendments and questions and answers concerning the announcement will be posted exclusively at the FedBizOpps website. All posted information will clearly display its date of posting. Offerors are reminded of the requirement to acknowledge all amendments (if any) in their proposal. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. Small business offerors submitting proposals should indicate whether they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned small business or an HBCU/MI. Any resulting efforts will fall under NAICS Code 541710, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. A cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract is contemplated. It is anticipated that the contractual effort will consist of one (1) award and will be a two (2) year basic effort with three (3) one-year priced option periods. The anticipated funds available for this effort are not anticipated to exceed $16.2M. Proposals will be due thirty days after the RFP release date. An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract. Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest (Jul 1997). The security classification of the contract is anticipated to be TOP SECRET/SCI. Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. Only offerors certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue, North, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, (1-888) 352-9333, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/, for further information on certification and the approval process. Offerors are required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal or to the Contracting Officer, if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal.

<DESC>Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is requesting proposals to supply ready-mix concrete to the Ok-A-Beh site, located approximately 10 miles from Ft. Smith, MT, in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.  The concrete shall be used on-site to fill voids in the canyon walls and will be pumped to three locations at the Ok-A-Beh site.  The maximum distance from the pumping unit to the voids will be approximately 300 feet.  A concrete mix design must be submitted for approval and final approval of aggregate size and weight will include acceptance of the mix by the pumping unit for its capabilities.  A lighter weight mix than the standards 150#/cu. ft. is preferred but not required. Proposals will be evaluated and award of the material supply be based on the best value for the government.  Factors used to determine the best value shall be cost per cubic yard, amount of material deliverable per day, method of delivery (portable plant or truck), and mix design weight per cubic feet.  Quality control shall be the responsibility of the supplier and be verified by providing the test result of 6 random cylinder compressive strength reports, at the cost of the supplier, with samples selected by the government. Concrete shall be supplied on indefinite dates and in indefinite quantities per day.  It is anticipated the total amount of concrete supplied will be within a range of 516 cubic yards minimum and 967 cubic yards maximum.

The amount of concrete required per day could vary from a minimum of 6 cu. yds. to a maximum of 500 cu.yds.  If one supplier is unable to provide the required amount per day, the National Park Service shall obtain concrete from additional other best value suppliers to meet delivery requirement for the work project.  Proposals shall be based on concrete specifications of: minimum compressive strength of 3000 psi.; maximum aggregate size of 1 inch; maximum weight of 165 pounds per cubic feet; to include fiberglass fibers in the mix; minimum quantity of 516 cubic yards; maximum quantity of 967 cubic yards.  All proposals will be evaluated and a single propposal or a combination of proposals may be awarded to meet the requirements of a successful project completion.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Biochemistry (LB) plans to procure repair service and replacement parts for the Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope from Carl Zeiss, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.  The supplies and services herein and being procure under the simplified acquisition procedure authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811310 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  The overall goal of the Laboratories is to investigate basic cellular processes at both the cellular and subcellular level. There are approximately eight (8) to nine (9) labs in LB and LMCB that utilize the confocal microscopy on a regular basis as a critical part of their research programs to study diverse processes such as localization of replication components in bacteria, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, and cell cycle regulation.  The facility has also been used by groups from National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and several other labs within the NCI. The ability to image up to eight labeled components in real time, plus the additional benefits of the Zeiss LSM 510 system, provides an enormous resource to the laboratories currently using the system.  This system also allows the NCI facility to provide flexibility to other NCI users by supplementing the existing NCI core microscopy facility. Subsequent to installation of the LSM 510 confocal microscope, the Electronic Control Unit was inadvertently damaged.  This unit is critical to the function of the unit, as it controls and integrates all system components including laser, microscope, and scan module. This allows individual image acquisition conditions to be duplicated EXACTLY and guarantees that the system is calculating any measurements correctly since any change in objective or zoom is noted whether it is done by hand or within the software. The system also supports digital scan control/multi-tracking to eliminate cross talk between channels for dual- and multi-labeled specimens. The digital scan control allows for the following hardware/software functionality:  constant scanning velocity for all speeds, even illumination along scanning fields with identical pixel conditions, short fly back time (less than 2% of frame cycle), on-line modification of scanning and detector settings, on-line histogram and lut's for optimization, sample preservation via beam blanking only in regions of interest and FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photo-bleaching).  The unit also provides multi-tracking capability via digital scan control, which allows high speed multiplexing of excitation wavelengths by line to get rid of cross talk between channels and spectral characterization of multi-labeled specimens with at least 10 nm resolution.  Services shall be performed by factory trained personnel that specifically work on and repair the LSM 510 confocal microscope.  Carl Zeiss, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned supplies and services.  The LSM 510 confocal system is an integrated unit, with the E-box, the central controller for all aspects of functionality of the system. Carl Zeiss is the only manufacturer of this essential component for this particular system. To award this contract to another manufacturer would entail the purchase of a whole new system at an extensive cost to the Government.  No other manufacturer can supply this part. Due to the reasons stated above, it is imperative that the unit is repaired quickly as possible.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on May 21, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   NAICS Code:334516 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Affymetrix, Inc. of Santa Clara, CA. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the GCS 3000 Gene Chip Micro Array System.  The system is an integrated platform for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring gene expression levels in bacteria, rat, mouse and human. In addition to gene expression profiling, this platform will soon be useful for SNIP analysis using a 10,000 gene array platform.  The principal benefit will be to our  Microarray Analysis for Evaluating Genotoxicology and Cell Signaling Research, and specifically to Genetic response of Bacteria (such as Pseudomonad aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,..etc), when exposed to antimicrobial agents (such as alcohol, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide).   In addition,  EPA will use this as part of a core genomics facility.  Work on this project has already been completed by the University of Maryland- specifically, the mapping of the P. aeruginosa and E. coli genes.  Since our market research indicates that this technology is relatively new and there is no  industry standard, procuring a GeneChip system other that Affymetrix would necessitate reduplication of the effort to map the genes mentioned above.  It is believed that any cost savings which may be achieved through competition cannot offset the cost of the in-house effort to duplicate the work  performed by the University of Maryland.  Offerors who can provide an equivalent model micro array system to the GCS 3000 which can be proven to be fully compatible with the preexisting unit at the University of Maryland can contact Alan Scanio at (202) 564-9616.  Please refer to Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source Purchase Order to Maritz Research. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain syndicated automotive research data and results pertaining to the new car-buying market in order to implement an effective market-based incentive labeling program through the Office of Transportation Air Quality's (OTAQ) SmartWay Program. Due to information collection restrictions, obtaining the syndicated survey from Maritz Research, which analyzes approximately 90,000 responses from recent car buyers, is  the most valid and cost-effective method for OTAQ to make informed decisions regarding strategic planning of a vehicle labeling program. It has been determined that Maritz Research is the only available vendor able to fulfill this requirement.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541910.  NO  SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  However, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Interested firms shall provide  detailed information outlining their capabilities and abilities to perform this specific requirement.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source contract to Nooralian Nelson and Associates for the design and purchase of an additional generator for backup electrical power at its Operations Center located at 6432 General Green Way in Alexandria, Virginia.  The current backup generator does not have the capacity to handle the additional power demand if the SEC would need to re-constitute its office at the Operations Center in the event of a catastrophic event in Washington DC.  It is essential to redesign the facility to house a second generator and to have the architectural, electrical and civil plans completed to allow for an immediate changeover from the local power grid to generator power.  Nooralian Nelson designed the base building structure and performed interior design for the SEC in the initial build out and subsequent modifications to the Operations Center building.  No other firm would possess the knowledge of the Operations Center building that would allow them to immediately begin work.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302 (Unusual and Compelling Urgency).  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely considered to be within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This announcement is to notify all interested parties that Det 8 Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking to award a small business set-aside contract for the upcoming NWCA effort and anticipates releasing a solicitation F29601-03-R-0001 on or about 9 January 2003 entitled Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA) Support. NWCA has primary technical and programmatic Air Force responsibility for Department of Defense (DoD) and National Nuclear Security Agency-Department of Energy (NNSA-DOE) nuclear weapon and counterproliferation activities. Activities include: (1) weapon effectiveness analysis, systems design and evaluations, and operational studies for counterforce strikes against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) and other asymmetric threats; (2) CBRNE target and intelligence assessments; (3) nuclear weapon modifications assessments, life extension assessments, system and component analysis, and management from operational deployment through retirement; (4) technical and programmatic oversight, technical interchange participation and documentation including summary reports of Nuclear Weapons Project Officers Groups (POGs). Nuclear weapon and counterproliferation solution concepts are developed and fielded through the USAF, DoD, and DOE acquisition processes to meet user requirements and ensure continued mission readiness, operation, and reliability certification throughout their lifetime.  Interaction between the USAF, DoD, and DOE agencies occurs through integrated product teams led by AF NWCA. To support this objective, NWCA is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed at the contractors facility and on-site at NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM: (A) program management, (B) engineering, (C) scientific, (D) computational, (E) analysis, (F) testing, (G) technical reporting/documentation, (H) targeting/intelligence, (I) office administration and (J) network administration.  The primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support NWCA programs such as nuclear stockpile sustainment and life extension; agent defeat weapons concept development; and targeting and collateral effects tools development and application. Due to possible office space constraints at NWCA, the effort may have to be performed off-base at the contractors facility. Therefore, the contractor facility must be located within a 50-mile radius of NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM. A draft RFP will not be issued for the acquisition; however, RFP attachments will be made available for viewing at the FedBizOpps website http://www.fedbizopps.gov prior to release of the RFP.  Offerors responding to this announcement are encouraged to monitor closely the website for potential changes to the acquisition. Offerors are also encouraged to register under the FedBizOpps Interested Vendors List (IVL). The list will allow vendors to register their interest in the solicitation and will be monitored and accessed by AFRL/PKVE personnel. Amendments and questions and answers concerning the announcement will be posted exclusively at the FedBizOpps website. All posted information will clearly display its date of posting. Offerors are reminded of the requirement to acknowledge all amendments (if any) in their proposal. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. Small business offerors submitting proposals should indicate whether they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned small business or an HBCU/MI. Any resulting efforts will fall under NAICS Code 541710, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. A cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract is contemplated. It is anticipated that the contractual effort will consist of one (1) award and will be a two (2) year basic effort with three (3) one-year priced option periods. The anticipated funds available for this effort are not anticipated to exceed $16.2M. Proposals will be due thirty days after the RFP release date. An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract. Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest (Jul 1997). The security classification of the contract is anticipated to be TOP SECRET/SCI. Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. Only offerors certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue, North, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, (1-888) 352-9333, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/, for further information on certification and the approval process. Offerors are required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal or to the Contracting Officer, if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) to be eligible to receive a contract award.

In addition to the 60,000 square feet of museum gallery space there will be an orientation theater, some general-purpose offices, a gift shop, an entry lobby and mechanical space.  The 60,000 square feet of gallery space will consist of 42,000 square feet of high bay space, 25  35 foot high, and a central gallery of 18,000 square feet enclosed by a monumental skylight.  The building is approximately 87,700 GSF on two levels.  Level one is 80,000 GSF and level two is 7,700 GSF.  There are options to add 7,500 GSF of additional exhibit space to level one and 8,500 GSF to level two for a total of 16,000 GSF of additional space.  The additional second level space will house additional offices, a multi-purpose room and a cafeteria with a full service kitchen.  The structural system is a combination of cast-in-place concrete walls and columns and steel columns and beams all supported by spread footings.  The roof and floor decks are primarily concrete fill on metal deck.  There will be earth berms around the perimeter of the building that will require significant earth work within the general footprint of the building.  The exterior cladding of the building is primarily cast-in-place architectural concrete, CMU and metal panels.  There is a limited amount of storefront windows and entrances.  All glazing will be laminated glass.  Unique Features:  the entire 18,000 square foot central gallery will have an asymmetrical cone shaped monumental skylight over it.  The skylight starts at a point 45 feet above the finish floor and extends to a point 150 feet above the finish floor.  A central stainless steel clad support mast for the skylight will extend from the finish floor elevation of the central gallery through the top of the skylight to a height of 205 feet.  The mast structure is a steel box frame.  The central gallery is a 150 foot diameter circular space with 45 feet high walls which are clad in travertine stone. The floor is epoxy terrazzo.  The work will require coordination with a work of a separate contract for the exhibitory in the gallery spaces.  It is anticipated that portions of this work will be done at the same time as the museum is being completed. There will be a series of milestone dates for turning over portions of the exhibit space for exhibit fabrication and installation that will occur prior to the completion of the museum.

Key Personnel Requirements

If one or more of the key personnel becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract such that it would substantially affect the final delivery date of any one item, the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer and her representative, promptly replace such personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal qualifications.

All requests for approval of substitutions hereunder must be in writing and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions.

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT CORRECTS THIS REQUIREMENT TO A SMALL-BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Amersham Bioscience in Piscataway, NJ to furnish, deliver, and install a new AKTA FPLC System, Software and Accessories at the USDA, ARS, NAA, N.E. Plant, Soil & Water Lab (NEPSWL), University of Maine, Orono, ME 04469. The NAICS is 334516 with a size of 500 employees and is unrestricted. The USDA, ARS, NEPSWL requires the Amersham Biosciences AKTA FPLC System and Accessories which will be used in the research and study of the principles of manure phosphorus chemistry for protein purification and gel filtrations of organic P in relevant agricultural sources.  Gel filtration chromatography will be used to investigate molecular size distribution of organic phosphorus in extracts from animal manure.  The system will also provide a means to purify phosphate-releasing enzymes with various chromatographic columns.  These purified enzymes will allow us to identify the types and determine the amounts of organic P with more accuracy. Purification of biomolecules from complex starting materials is a key component necessary for obtaining information about individual enzymes and their associated activities.  The ability to easily develop and optimize separation methods and protocols for isolating and characterizing research quantities of enzymes has been of critical importance in the application for enzyme-based technologies.  The system has great versatility and can be used to perform separations based on a wide variety of sample characteristics, including, but not limited to molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity.  For NEPSWLs intended applications, the AKTA-FPLC system, software and accessories must be fully integrated. SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS of the system are: Cold-room compatible. Biocompatible, syringe style dual pump system that can provide a flow rate range of 0.05 to 20 ml/min. with pressure ranges from 0-5 Mpa to allow the use of a variety of chromatographic columns.  A fraction collector capable of collecting by volume or automatic peak fractionation of up to 175 fractions.  Fraction marks and fraction numbers allow for easy identification of fractions and peeks.  The system must have a UV monitor with Hg lamp including 280nm and 254nm filters with an option of a Zn lamp for reading at 214nm for higher sensitivity.  The UV monitor must have a signal output range of 0.01 to 5.0 AUFS. The sensitivity of the conductivity monitor must be 1 uS/cm to 999mS/cm.  Ability to control up to nine motorized, electronically-driven valves which will allow simultaneously, expediting method changes and stepwise purification techniques.  Three-position motorized injection valve with a variety of loading loops and super loops to provide the capability of loading from 10 ml to 150ml of sample volume. The system shall include a(n): 1) Biocompatible HPLC system and all related hardware required for sampling, detection, analysis, and data storage associated with the fast and easy purification of protein and gel filtrations of organic P. 2) Expandable rack that provides the flexibility for the use of longer chromatographic columns, changes in the system configuration, and increases in automation and upgrading. 3) Operating software with pre-programmed method(s) template, evaluation software and flexibility in software design for upgrading added functionality. 4) Dynamic mixing to ensure efficient mixing of buffers for optimum results. 5) Wetted flow-path of the system must be inert to halides to allow the use of salt buffers required in some protein separations.  6) Be capable of forming gradients and include a motorized injection valve.  7) Have an in-line, flow-through conductivity monitor to allow for auto ranging between any two ionic-strength buffers.  The sensitivity of the conductivity monitor must be 1 uS/cm to 999mS/cm.  8) One set each of all equipment operating and software manuals.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS - In addition to he salient characteristics above, the Amersham Biosciences AKTA-LCMS allows the purification and study of biomolecules, such as enzymes, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides and nucleic acids, from complex starting materials using a variety of separation modes.  The system incorporates, in a fully integrated instrument, many features and controls that allow media screening, method scouting, method optimization and scaling experiments with minimum preparation time and maximum confidence in accuracy and reproducibility of results. A. The Biocompatible Liquid Chromatograph System must have: 1) The ability to separate biomolecules based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge and hydrophobicity; 2) A biocompatible pump and provide flow rates from 0.001 to 10 mL/min. with pressure ranges from 0 to 3625 psi.; 3) The entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides and the pump must be capable of washing behind the piston seal to ensure no salt crystal formation, which would reduce piston life; 4) Two separate pumps with dynamic high pressure mixing to produce high accuracy and precision in gradient formation required for high-resolution separations. 5) Switching valves and controls that allow for accurate automatic buffer preparation from stock solutions and be controlled through the system control software. 6) Maintain and control the pH throughout the run, automatically compensating for changes in temperature and salt concentrations. 7) The ability for column switching without manually connecting and reconnecting tubing and columns into the flow path. 8) The equilibration of columns' before and after runs must be capable of being monitored with a feed-back loop to the control system to be certain that equilibration is complete without consuming excess buffers.  B) A fraction collector that is: 1) Capable of collecting by volume or automatic peak fractionation of up to 175 fractions.

<DESC>NA The Industrial Base Readiness Division of the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing either or both of the subject fuzes. The technical POC is: Greg Papatrefon, US Ar my Research and Development Engineering Center (ARDEC), (973)724-5681. The technical descriptions of the items are as follows:  (1) Fuze, Hand Grenade, M213, NSN: 1330-00-182-3570, DODIC: G877.  The M213 is a pyrotechnic, delay detonating fuze used to initiate fragmentation hand grenades. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety pin and pull ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the le ver tight to the body.  When the lever is released, the spring loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer. The primer ignites a delay element which sets off the detonator which initiates the main grenade charge.  The delay composition provides a fixed  time delay. (2) Fuze, Hand Grenade, M228, NSN: 1330-00-168-5502, DODIC: G878. The M228 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used in conjunction with the M69 Grenade body, as a trainer for the M67 Fragmentation Hand Grenade. The M228 emits a small puff of smoke when activated.  The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the body.  When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites a delay element, wh ich initiates the igniter, which in turn sets off an audible signal and a white smoke charge.  The M228 functions the same as the M213 except it ignites versus detonates. This survey is being conducted to evaluate expansion of the production capability of the existing fuze base for the subject items.  This effort is in anticipation of potential increases in requirements that would create a greater demand for the subject fuz es than the current base is capable of handling. For purposes of this survey, anticipated quantities may be in the following ranges: M213 Pyro Delay Detonated Fuze:  53k-70k/month M228 Pyro Delay Igniting:  517k-554k/month The Government is seeking to improve the current design of the M213/M228 fuzes with emphasis on cost reduction, improvements to reliability and greater producibility.  The contractor shall have the engineering capability to perform an analysis of the gover nment furnished TDPs and it's intended production process. The government envisions a joint contractor-government effort to identify areas of improvement. Any approved changes to the TDP will be incorporated via the ECP process.  Responses to this survey can be for 1/4 to maximum quantity, individual fuzes, or combined.  The M213 and the M228 fuzes have been and are, currently produced by small business.  This survey is going worldwide, to both, large & small business concerns. The se two (2) items are being researched together based on similarities in their production processes. This is not an indication that these items will be combined for any future procurement or acquisition strategy. Additional information regarding the above i tems can be requested from the above POC. A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical capability, manufacturing capacity, and certification to receive export-controlled technical data (as applicable).  Intere sted companies who have the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the following information; a brief summary of your company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maxi mum monthly production quantities, estimated prices, and the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for production. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, export-controlled tech data certification, personnel, etc) a vailable, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these crit eria. Attached is a questionnaire requesting specific information regarding your company's capability. Please complete this questionnaire, in addition to the information requested above. This information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: US ARMY JOINT MUNITIONS COMMAND, ATTN: AMSJM-RDI/KEVIN BLAKE, E-mail: blakek@osc.army.mil, BLDG 350, ROCK ISLAND, IL 61299-6000.

<ARCHDATE>08052003
<CONTACT>Rhonda Chase, (757) 878-3766
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is requesting information to enhance our understanding of industry's capability and to survey industry feedback regarding our planned approach to and the programmatic requirements of an Advanced Technology Development (ATD) project for a prototype high performance, embedded, mission avionics processing architecture for potential application to multiple tactical unmanned air vehicles (TUAV).  This information will be used to develop programmatic ap proach and to finalize planning documents including the Statement of Work (SOW) for our requirement to competitively solicit an ATD for MCAP Phase III.  The planned approach is for a UAV Mission Architecture Systems Engineer to coordinate and assimilate th e efforts of UAV manufacturers to derive the common architecture for UAV processing requirements. To develop this requirement, AATD seeks information regarding current and future functional requirements, overall state-of-the art with respect to architectur e designs and implementations, the shortcomings of current systems to meet evolving needs, affordability considerations, prevailing and evolving standards, hardware and software commonality opportunities, and Objective Force Future Combat Systems (OF FCS) interoperability (concentrating primarily on the interoperability of manned helicopters and TUAVs).  In addition, AATD requests information regarding modularity, open systems interface standards, market driven commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics, s oftware reuse, obsolescence mitigation, upgrade-ability, technology refresh, scalability, and potential solutions to airworthiness qualification issues.  AATD is interested in the systems engineering processes required to translate future operational needs  into architecture specifications and in organizing a team to coordinate a preferred design approach throughout the TUAV industry.  Stringent TUAV environmental requirements, space, weight, and power considerations, and technical performance objectives wil l drive network design and computing infrastructure component selection including interfaces, transmission media, network devices, enclosures, mission processors, and software architecture and applications.   Using this information, AATD intends develop a Statement of Work (SOW)  to competitively  select a MCAP Phase III UAV Mission Architecture Systems Engineer.   This system engineer is expected to conduct OF FCS communications and interoperability requirements research and definition; perform mission pro cessing infrastructure design, standards selection, and documentation; enlist the participation of UAV systems integrators; coordinate with the MCAP Phase II Manned Vehicle Systems Engineer via regular working group participation; develop the embedded miss ion architecture; and plan, coordinate and conduct interoperability demonstrations.  AATD anticipates releasing a Request for Proposal for the MCAP Phase III Systems Engineering effort on or about 31 July and award on or about 1 November 2003.  AATD is con sidering awarding a contract, a technology investment agreement, or other instrument for the effort depending upon industry interest in financial and technical participation.  This level of effort is estimated at approximately $4 million dollars with an ex pected period of performance through the end of Fiscal Year 2005.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract.  Prior to receipt of proposals, we plan to conduct Information Exchange Meetings (3-4 hours) individually with industry to promote early dialog to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities.  I nterested parties can include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of t he acquisition.During these meetings, we can also identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type/instrument, acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requi rements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry con cerns or questions.  Interested parties for the MCAP Phase III Systems Engineer effort are encouraged to participate in the Information Exchange Meetings and join AATD in discussions.  We hope to enhance our understanding of FCS interoperability requiremen ts, share ideas related to embedded mission processing architectures for TUAVs,  and exchange ideas relative to the Government's planned approach to their acquisition.  We expect open dialog on the Statement of Work and encourage feedback/comments.  Those who do not participate in the site visits are still encouraged to review and comment/suggest on the Statement of Work posted to our AATD website: http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Docs/P3_SOW_20030428.doc and to submit your proposal in response to the RFP.  We will schedule visits up to 6 June 2003.  For more information, contact the AATD point of contact, Mr. Allen Walker, at (757) 878-2516 (awalker@aatd.eustis.army.mil) or Mr. Dale Johnson, at (757) 878-0 123, djohnson@aatd.eustis.army.mil).

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection (FP) Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology that can provide a lightweight, self-contained, disposable intravenous (IV) pump for use in immediate transportation of patients attached to an IV in a field environment using either standard or modified IV tube/bag technology.    The concept is to keep the IV fluid flowing when the bag is at or lower than the patient.  Current IV pumps have multiple functions that increase their weight, size, and cost.  Their bulk and expense and need for large heavy battery support and follow-on periodic recharging renders them unusable in a deployed location where weight, size and cost are prohibitive.  Providing fluids to patients is recognized as a critical first step-in medical intervention for wounded forces.  This care is often delayed when in transport or is hindered by the use of unstable/tedious IV pole devices or additional personnel to provide the height required for gravity dependent fluid flow.  This device would free up additional military/medical personnel and provide for continuous delivery of IV fluids and medications during any stage of patient transport.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  This device should weigh less than 1 lb, utilize a small lightweight self-contained battery system (i.e. lithium), and be of minimal cost to be considered disposable.  The battery system should support the device for a minimum of 12 hrs and would ideally allow for 3 flow rates (15cc/hr, 125cc/hr and 250cc/hr).   The device should easily attach to either standard or modified IV tubing/bag technology and be water/weather/vibration resistant.  It should not interfere with any other electrical or flight devices.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or near mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical technology available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the Air Force, funding will be sought for concept and/or prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Combat Command.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 27 May 2003.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Edward Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctcnsc.org or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS MR. LILLION.  You may contact Mr. Lillion with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6516.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Offerors are advised that only the Air Force FP Battlelab is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>The USAF Force Protection (FP) Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology that allows for noninvasive continuous monitoring of patients metabolic status to include glucose, electrolytes and other analytes in a real time basis.  The device(s) should be small, easily applied to the surface/skin of the patient, and provide for clear visualization and interpretation of results in both full and diminished light.  The correct use of the device should require minimal training and be fully functional in field and flight conditions.  Currently there are no real-time medical devices that can give the field medic and medics treating patients in transport (air/land) access to continuous metabolic monitoring that would allow for more immediate medical intervention. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  The system would be a small patch-like device that would allow for real-time monitoring through the surface/skin of the patient with a digital lighted readout or by use of a hand-held device to secure a reading from the attached surface device.  The device(s) should be able to adhere to skin with minimal preparation of the surface, be portable with self-contained power supply, water/weather/vibration resistant, and be miniaturized.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or near mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.

<DESC>Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center has a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) in place that was issued on a sole-source basis to Raytheon McKinney TX for the repair, production, engineering services, maintenance and upgrade of the AN/AAS-44(V)FLIR system and the AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting System, and other derivatives.  These systems are used on the RQ-1 Predator platform and the SH-60R multi-mission helicopter.  The BOA was placed in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 in the estimated amount of $49,900,00.00 as approved on 13 September 2000 by the NSWC Headquarters Competition Advocate Approving Official.  On 22 October 2001 the NTE amount was increased by $135 Million to $184.9 Million by ASN RDA, in accordance with FAR 6.302-2.  The Government intends to procure 58 Turrent Units and 40 Electronic Units under t he BOA within the next six months.  The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement through any other source.  This synopsis is issued to advertise requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a six month period.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Point of Contact is Ms. Vonda Pollock, Code 1165ZH, Bldg 3291, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.  Telephone 812-854-3683, or FAX 812-854-5066.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR
<DESC>Request for Information on the Acquisition Strategy for Design, Development, and Operation of an Orbital Space Plane System This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to seek other appropriate government agency and industry/contractor comments and inputs on the acquisition strategy for the design, development, production, and operation activities of an Orbital Space Plane (OSP) System.  This information will be used in development of the OSP Program's Acquisition Strategy Plan.  As mandated in NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan, a crew transport vehicle is the crucial component of an OSP System, reflecting NASA's need to ferry space station crewmembers and ensure that a capability exists for crew rescue in an emergency situation.  It is the Government's intent to foster competition and facilitate an efficient and effective acquisition process.  Receipt of pertinent information and questions will foster a better understanding of the OSP System requirements and industry's capabilities for satisfying those requirements.  Lessons learned from other government agencies experienced in innovative systems acquisition management will assist NASA in establishing an effective strategy for the design, development, production, operation, and sustainment of an integrated OSP System focused on capabilities, not assets.  This early exchange of information can also help identify and resolve concerns or questions regarding the OSP System acquisition strategy, which impacts all future phases of the OSP Program and all interested parties.	In this context, interested parties include potential offerors, system end users, government acquisition and support personnel, other government agencies, and other parties involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.	The OSP Program Officelocated at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centerin conjunction with NASA Headquarters and other NASA Centers, is in the process of identifying known and anticipated concerns, issues, and decision points for the OSP System.  This review includes all activities, processes, procedures, personnel, hardware, software, vehicles, and infrastructure necessary to satisfy all requirements for implementing an OSP System. Specifically, this RFI seeks information relating to the items	A)   Development of a Performance and Risk-Based Acquisition Management strategy to maximize design, development, production, operation, safety, and sustainment effectiveness while minimizing total life cycle cost.   B)  Appropriate management structure for ownership, operation, and sustainment of the OSP System (e.g., Government Owned/Contractor Operated, Contractor Owned/Contractor Operated, or other) C)    Transition between the various phases of the Program (e.g., Design, Development, Test and Evaluation-DDT&E, production, certification, operations, etc.).  For example, should there be a single contract for all phases, separate contracts for each phase, or some combination? D)    Technical, economic, and management complexity of operating on a single ELV family or multiple ELV families. E) Appropriate mix of modeling and simulation versus testing to certify and qualify the OSP System. F)     Best strategy to develop and implement upgrades to the OSP System.  For instance, should the Program utilize a spiral development process as sometimes used in the DoD, or is there another process that would be of benefit? G)	  Advantages and disadvantages of the Government and the OSP System contractor(s)/ contractor teams agreeing on a common set of information management systems, data management systems, and other types of software products (e.g., project schedule, risk management, CAD, CM/DM, etc.). H)     Recommendations on successful programs that should be contacted for benchmarking and developing a set of "best practices" that can be used to guide development of the OSP System.  I)  Suggestions for improving the management structure (of the Government or the contractor(s)), or other areas that would lead to more efficient DDT&E and operations phases of the OSP System. J) Comments and/or suggestions for improvement on the tentative draft acquisition schedule (attached).	K) Comments and/or suggestions on establishing an Industry Observation Program for potential competitors, e.g., information about the value of facilities tours, meetings, industry reviews, etc. L)       Possible breakout of the proposed Statement of Work (SOW) into subsystems to allow selection of multiple contractors depending on expertise and other evaluation criteria. M)	 Utility of a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that captures Level I & II Requirements but shifts the responsibility for preparing detailed SOWs for Program Phases to the Offerors. N)	 The Government is considering employment of a "Flexible Progressive Competition" acquisition approach.	See NASA FAR Supplement Subpart 1817.73 - Phased Acquisition.  Under this acquisition approach the government would define and solicit comprehensive proposals for all program phases through, for example, verification/certification/1st flight of the OSP System (e.g., PDR, CDR, Production, and Flight Verification/Certification).  The Government would retain the flexibility to (1) select a single contractor and award a comprehensive contract through OSP System verification/certification, or (2) select multiple contractors and award contracts through a discrete program phase (e.g., PDR) with options through certification or 1st flight and make subsequent down-selection(s) at later program phases to be determined by the NASA.  Proposals for subsequent down-selection(s) would be obtained through a less formal solicitation and may only require updates to the comprehensive proposal received as a result of the initial solicitation. The issues delineated above are not intended to be exhaustive.  Respondents are encouraged to provide any additional comments that will help the Program develop the best OSP System acquisition strategy.  The Government may ask respondents additional or follow-up questions. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development.  Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. Additional OSP Program information is available at either www.aerospace.nasa.gov/programs/ast.htm or www.SLInews.com/  This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time.	As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3. All responses need to be provided in MS Word document format, both hard copy and electronic media.  Font should be Times New Roman, size 12.  Responses should not exceed 2 pages per item with the total response not exceeding 30 pages.  Please submit responses no later than May 23, 2003, to NASA/MSFC Procurement Office, Attn:  PS51/Walt Melton, Contracting Officer, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812.  Additional questions should be provided to Walt Melton via e-mail: Walter.S.Melton@nasa.gov .  A copy of any questions should be sent to Mark Stiles via e-mail: Mark.R.Stiles@nasa.gov

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Technology Division (MCWL-TD), Quantico, VA is issuing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for a contract for a two-phased approach to design and build a prototype vehicle.  The vehicle must prove internally transportable in the MV-22 aircraft; have diesel fueled (or a diesel/hybrid variation) propulsion, capably operate as a weapons platform to mount and employ an M2, .50 caliber and MK19 40mm machine gun (one weapons station that is interoperable with either machine gun).  Additionally the vehicle must carry, as a minimum a crew of three (driver plus 2 crewmen) and must be able to operate in all environmental conditions and all terrain types.  

Fully developed requirements for this type of vehicle do not exist, therefore, no documentation will be made available on the below cited web site.

This is intended to be a two-phase program.  The first phase is the vehicle design phase.  The second phase is an option for the prototype vehicle build phase.

We are interested in approaches that fully utilize the most current and advanced vehicle design and prototype build technology available.  Additionally, given the impending fielding of the MV-22 in FY06, we are interested in vendors capable of expeditious completion of this work, having a thorough knowledge of all aspects of vehicle design, and having the personnel, design tools and vehicle production capability available immediately.

The offeror is directed to the following website where specific proposal submission information is provided under solicitation M67854-03-R-9019:  http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/alsv.asp.

The Marine Corps intends to make one award pursuant to this Broad Agency Announcement, but reserves the right to make no awards under this BAA.  The final deliverables of the contract for Phase I must be submitted no later than 120 days after contract award.  The deliverables of the contract for Phase II must be submitted no later than twelve (12) months after initial contract award.  The entire MCWL budget for this effort to include both Phases is no more than $2,800,000.

Industry with experience in prototype vehicle design and build, hardware production and computer aided vehicle design are encouraged to participate.  The Contracting Officer for this BAA is Lynn Y. Frazier, telephone (703) 432-0349, facsimile (703) 784-5826 and e-mail frazierly@mcsc.usmc.mil.
