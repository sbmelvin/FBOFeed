<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTES.  NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS AWARD WILL BE MADE ON OR ABOUT MAY 31ST UNDER SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a sole source non-competitive procurement to RAS, Inc., for flowmeter and geophysical logging services, principally using a prototype, scanning colloidal borescope flowmeter (SCBFM) and other logging tools (induction and natural gamma logs, either a caliper or a video log) on 4-5 wells averaging 150-200 feet in depth.  This is in cooperation with the U.S. Army Environmental Center at Camp Bullis near San Antonio, Texas.  The SCBFM is unique in using a sonde-based light source, variable focus lens (36-136X), CCD sensor (camera) and software to photograph and measure the velocity and direction of movement of large, optically visible colloids and larger particles across a 0.5m measurement interval.  RAS, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide these services as they are the sole private vendor for SCBFM measurements, owns several parts inseparable from the SCBFM that are essential to probe operation, and have four years experience with operation of the SCBFM through field and laboratory testing. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541690.  No additional synopsis will be published.  Any questions regarding this announcment may be submitted via email to lmccarthy@usgs.gov.  Reference "06ER-36NOSOLICITATION" in the subject line of all emails.

<DESC>USAID’s Last Mile Initiative, now present in twenty-five USAID countries, redefines the idea of the “last mile” barrier to include overcoming two constraints: 
•	Overcome geographic isolation by launching an irreversible revolution in the sustainable provision of ICT services to rural areas, partnering with both international and local private sector interests to connect rural customers to the world; and
•	Overcome economic and social isolation by transforming the development prospects of farming, small businesses and new start-ups through IT-driven increases in productivity. 

LMI is designed to support broader Mission objectives such as competitiveness, rural development, workforce development, and peace & democracy because up-to-date information and reliable and affordable communication is essential for development and USAID priorities.  LMI also supports delivering USAID programming to rural sites.
While ICTA is supporting the Nanasala roll-out, there are several ways in which USAID can add value by enabling the private sector to deliver ICT and development services through LMI centers.
USAID/Colombo seeks to target areas in strategic locations including areas where USAID is presently operating. One example may be where the Government of Sri Lanka Vocational Technical Authority (VTA) schools are being built under the USAID Tsunami Reconstruction Program.  Further, USAID sponsored LMI centers should not be built where ICTA funded Nanasalas currently exist or are planned in the short-term (next 12 months).

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service (NWS) has a requirement for 2,400 Loran-C Mark II Microsondes (Sippican Part Number 1543-611 with chip thermistor) to be delivered F.O.B. Destination to the National Logistics Support Center in Kansas City, Missouri commencing in November 2006.  NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc. (Sippican), located in Marion, Massachusetts.  Sippican is the sole manufacturer of the Loran-C Mark II Microsonde and is the only known source that can provide the required supplies.  This particular model of Loran-C radiosonde is required, because it is the only known Loran-C radiosonde which is compatible with the existing W-9000 ground equipment at the three upper air sites where the radiosondes will be flown.  Changing the ground equipment at the present time is not practicable.  Although NOAA expects that only Sippican can provide the required supplies, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Solicitation DG133W-06-RP-0151 will be issued on or about June 2, 2006 and will close on or about July 3, 2006.  See Notes 12, 22, and 26.

Evidence submitted should clearly demonstrate the vendor's ability to provide the requisite services and the price for doing so.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. No solicitation document exists and requests for such will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  As a result of analyzing the responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued, but no additional synopsis will be published.  Any such solicitation will be issued to the intended vendor and all firms that respond to this synopsis of intent and demonstrate their technical capability to provide the required services.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541810   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation to be issued for proposals and a written solicitation will not be issued.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE.  Solicitation GA-06-00032 is issued as a Commercial Solicitation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.  This acquisition will be 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS  code is 541810.  The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer best conforms to the Statement of Work (SOW), meets the Governments delivery schedule and is the most cost effective in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria  below.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular.  The contractor shall be required to provide non-personal services to include all labor, design, tools, equipment, material, and other items and  services necessary to develop and implement the following SOW.  STATEMENT OF WORK - 1.BACKGROUND:  The Worker Protection Standard (WPS) has been in effect since 1992.  The EPA Regions and States have made great strides in implementing the WPS provisions; however, despite these efforts there is  still a need to enhance our outreach and communication efforts.  Specifically, EPA needs to find more effective ways to educate workers regarding their rights under the WPS. In addition, EPA seeks to undertake activities to address the current violation reporting system, providing greater assurance  of the anonymity of the workers that report violations.  To accomplish this we will use innovative methods for reaching and educating farm workers on their rights under WPS. The purpose of the Radio Outreach to Hispanic Agricultural Workers Project is to develop and disseminate educational  information on pesticide farm safety and WPS to Spanish speaking farm workers via radio Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on Spanish language radio stations.  Many Spanish speaking farm workers remain unaware of the WPS or the fact that they can report violations of the WPS.  Furthermore, those  that do wish to report violations are afraid to do so for fear of retaliation, even though the WPS has provisions against such retaliation.  Thus, through radio PSAs which shall supply a toll-free number, individuals can call and be referred to the appropriate agency for filing an anonymous  complaint, or be referred to a place where they can get more information on pesticide safety.  The contractor shall develop a program to develop and disseminate PSAs, working closely with EPA Region 4 staff who will assist in providing content. 2. GOALS:  To educate Spanish speaking farm workers  about the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) and basic pesticide safety on the farm and at home.  A) To increase Spanish speaking farm workers' reporting of violations of the WPS.  B) To increase Spanish speaking farm workers' calls to a toll free number to answer pesticides related questions. 3.  OBJECTIVES:  A) Development of a series of PSAs in Spanish, which shall be transferable to radio stations throughout Region 4.  B) Collect data on numbers of call-in responses to a toll free number in response to the PSA. 4. PERFORMANCE REQUIRED:  ITEM 1.  The contractor shall develop a series of  10 to 12 Public Service Announcements (PSAs), in accordance with generally-accepted radio broadcast practices, and approved for content and acceptable presentation by the EPA Pesticide Office at Region 4.  The series shall cover all basic areas of the Worker Protection Standards (WPS), as well as  general pesticide safety and violation reporting. Each PSA shall be one to two minutes in length, and shall inform listeners of the toll-free number that they may call anonymously for further information about pesticides or how to report violations.   The contractor shall provide EPA with both  print and recorded copies of all PSAs in a format or media that would be most readily transferable to additional radio stations for broadcast.  The contractor shall also grant EPA all data rights for additional use of the material. Within 30 days of award of the purchase order, EPA shall provide  the contractor with copies of 24 previously developed PSAs which covered only the basic areas of the WPS and pesticide safety--which will provide approved content and information which may be incorporated into the new PSAs, if desired.  EPA will approve or disapprove the series of PSAs within 30  days of submittal of a final copy.  If an option is exercised for pre-paid violation reporting postcards at the time of the initial award of the purchase order, the PSA series shall also contain information about them.  ITEM 2.  The contractor shall provide a telephone number which may be dialed  toll-free from anywhere in Georgia from a latitude south of and including Macon.  Such telephone line shall be manned by a Spanish speaking operator(s) at least eight hours a day on normal Federal business days between 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Such line shall be maintained for a period of at least  ten calendar months--beginning with the airing of the first PSAs--with people trained to obtain correct violation information and provide callers with basic pesticide information or to direct them to further information. Within 60 days after the end of the ten month period, the contractor shall  provide EPA with a final report of all activities included in this purchase order, and specifically listing the number and types of calls received (whether reporting violations or requesting information) and general summary information about call activity and other work performed for this purchase  order. ITEM 3.  The contractor shall be responsible for distributing copies of the PSA series to Spanish language radio stations whose broadcast signals are normally capable of being heard in southern Georgia (from a latitude including Macon south).  The contractor is responsible for obtaining  agreement from each station to begin airing of the series of approved PSAs no later than the first of the month beginning seven months after award of the purchase order. The contractor shall be paid for each Spanish language station (up to a maximum of 15) that it gets to air the series of PSAs  between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.  The radio station must agree to air the full series of PSAs at least once per month during the ten calendar month period in which the toll free number is operational.   The contractor shall submit to EPA documentation from each station stating that  they aired the PSAs as specified. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Twenty (20) months from date of contract award. OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  The following may be ordered by EPA based on available funding.  Should any of the items listed below be required, EPA would include this in the initial purchase order  or may exercise the option to add this item on or before October 31, 2007. BACKGROUND:  some farm workers come from extremely rural areas of Mexico or Central America and may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with telephone operation, and even those who do feel comfortable with operating a telephone  may still only have access to one at their place of employment.  Because we are asking workers to report violations of their employers, many may feel uncomfortable using the telephone at work for this purpose.  In order to circumvent the telephone and to have an additional option to the toll free  number, Region 4 proposes the use of ready made, self-addressed and stamped postcards that would be addressed to the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA).  These postcards, written in Spanish, could list workers' name, but the entry would be optional.  These cards could be dropped in any  mail-box, at any time, for an anonymous violation report.  The Georgia Department of Agriculture has already agreed to work with Region 4 or a contractor to pilot this activity to potentially increase the numbers of tips and complaints that they receive. OPTION ITEM 1:  The contractor shall design  and print pre-paid postcards requesting all of the information required to make an anonymous report of a violation , and meeting postal standards. The violation postcards may be ordered in lots of 50 postcards each, up to a maximum of 32 lots (1,600 pre-paid cards). OPTION ITEM 2:  The contractor  shall distribute the anonymous violation reporting cards at locations where workers would frequent outside of work (e.g. Western Union, health clinics, migrant community centers, etc.)  In order to assure wide dissemination, the cards shall be distributed no more than 50 cards per location, at no  more than four locations per county within target counties.  The contractor, in consultation with EPA specialists and Southern Georgia migrant organizations, will determine the target counties based on migrant population.  The number of target counties will be determined by the number of lots  ordered for distribution in item one (e.g. - ordering the maximum of 32 lots would equal a minimum of 8 target counties for distribution, at four locations per county.) The contractor shall be paid per lot of 50 pre-paid cards distributed for display, up to a maximum of 32 distribution lots.  The  contractor shall certify the business name, address, county, and number of cards distributed for each distribution lot. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Award will be based on Best Value where price is more important  than experience and past performance information. Each offeror shall provide past  performance information that illustrates any work they have performed in the areas stated below.  The offeror shall provide references, including contract/order no., agencies/firms with whom you contracted, performance period, technical point of contact and phone number, and other relevant  evidence. A.	Working with Hispanic audiences on health and safety related issues or other issues of concern to the community; B.	Developing professional quality PSAs in Spanish; C.	Distributing PSAs to Hispanic radio stations, especially radio  stations which broadcast in the Southern Georgia  area; D.	Provision and maintenance of a toll free number for responses to the PSAs; E.	Ability to track call-in data to the toll free number for determining the effectiveness of the media message; F.	Evidence of community impact resulting from previous PSAs or other types of media outreach your  firm has developed, such as increase in phone calls to a hotline, survey results, related workshops your firm has conducted, increased hits on websites, community attendance at relevant meetings, or other similar evidence of community impact. G.	Knowledge of pesticide safety and EPA's Worker  Protection Standard (Desired but not required.) Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the supplier is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements and quality control.  It is also the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and  provisions.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611420   The Environmental Protection Agency Region 4 intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to the Phoenix Consultant Group to  train employees from 6 states to utilize the Compliance Activity Tracking System (CATS); and convert data from the various data bases in eight (8) sates to the CATS.  This system will be used by the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee (EPA Region 4 "States").   The Phoenix Consultant Group developed the CATS for the Delaware Dept. of Agriculture under a grant  awarded by EPA Region 3 in Philadelphia, PA.  This system was adopted by the Region 4 Pesticide & Toxic Substances Branch under a purchase order issued by Region 4.  The Phoenix Consultant Group is currently hosting the Region 4 Web Based Program. The CATS is a program designed for Region 4 to  allow the States to share an online database system and to promote data exchange & information sharing across the Region.  It is anticipated, based on historical data, the CATS program will have over 60,000 records entered each year into the database, and the system will have about one hundred  (100) users. The Phoenix Consultant Group is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement because they developed and are maintaining the Region 4 CATS program.  Any firm believing it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit documentation to establish the potential of complying with the  above requirements.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received  will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<SUBJECT>D -- Temporary Extension of Pooling Administrator Services Contract

<CONTACT>Wilma Mooney, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-418-1865, Fax 202-418-5963, Email wilma.mooney@fcc.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is for a Thousands-Blocks Pooling Administration requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 5.2 and 6.3.  The synopsis serves to give notice of the Government’s intent to negotiate and issue a sole source bridge contract in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  This bridge contract is necessary to provide a continuation of critical services until the ongoing recompetition of the pooling administration services requirement is completed.  Pooling administration services are critical to preventing the exhaustion of numbering resources in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and must therefore be provided without interruption.  Interruption of pooling administration services would result in a more rapid depletion of numbering resources nationwide and a return to the near-crisis state of the NANP that existed prior to implementation of pooling administration. The requirement obligates the contractor to serve as an independent designated entity responsible for administering Thousands-Block number pools by assigning, managing, forecasting, reporting and processing data that will allow service providers in rate areas designated for Thousands-Block number pooling to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000.  Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources.  The Government intends to award a sole source bridge contract to NeuStar, Inc., the incumbent contractor.   NeuStar, Inc. has been providing the critical, highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 2001.  The existing contract is scheduled to expire on June 13, 2006.  The transition period from the incumbent to a new service provider is anticipated to last several months.  Due to the considerable transition period anticipated, the FCC has determined that only one contractor – NeuStar, Inc. – is capable of meeting the critical need for uninterrupted continuation of the pooling administration services for an interim period until completion of the ongoing recompetition.  Accordingly, award to any other source other than NeuStar, Inc. would result in an unacceptable interruption in fulfilling FCC mission requirements and could severely jeopardize the success of continuing to generate and implement the program as required by statute.  While it may be technically possible for other companies to provide the required services after a considerable transition period, the FCC believes that no contractor other than NeuStar, Inc. is capable of providing interim services beginning June 14, 2006 until the ongoing recompetition is completed.  Pooling Administration must continue to be provided without interruption.  Services are to cover a three-month period of performance with options for two, one-month periods of performance.  Award is anticipated prior to June 6, 2006.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it would be able to perform the interim services from June  14, 2006 until the ongoing recompetition is completed.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC.  A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FCC.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A presolicitation announcement of the recompetition requirement was publicized on May 8, 2006.  Interested vendors must contact Tony Wimbush, Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0932 or via email @ anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Fibergate 6076–C Franconia Road, Alexandria, VA under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), soliciting from a single source, for fiberoptic cable infrastructure in the Washington metropolitan area.  NIST previously acquired a physical connection into the Fibergate dark fiber cable infrastructure and activated a 1-pair fiber connection to University of Maryland Collage Park (UMCP).  Fiber is resistant to electronic eavesdropping, a result of its properties, whereas copper wire can be intercepted through inductive coupling (a magnet or other ferrous material that allows electricity to pass through it on a copper line. This requirement is for monthly usage of that fiber connection.  Since the fiber optic connection is delivered through the Fibergate cable infrastructure, Fibergate is the sole source to light the fiber.   A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about June 1, 2006, for a base year with four option years.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Question & Answers-1: Please find the attached file containing answers to questions presented by potential offerors for this solicitation. ORIGINAL ANNOUNCMENT: Title 49, United States Code, Chapter 443, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide insurance and issue or procure reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of American aircraft of foreign flag aircraft. Provision of such insurance is subject to several criteria. Such insurance must be necessary in the interest of air commerce or national security or to carry out the foreign policy of the United States. Further the insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from a commercial insurance company. The FAA is seeking proposals from interested parties to procure aviation insurance support services in the administration and settlement of insurance claims, the collection of information on commercial aviation insurance markets, evaluating program finances, and risk management and insurance brokerage services.  Provision of these services requires insurance industry contacts and agreements sufficient to form integrated claims adjustment and settlement teams to fit the unique circumstances of individual claims.  Further, knowledge is required of aviation insurance markets and insurer financing and risk mitigation techniques.  The service provider must understand the FAA aviation insurance program's statutory authority and responsibilities, and how these interface and impact program insurance coverage and claims settlements.  Finally, the insurance service contractor should not have current ongoing service contracts or relationships with air carriers, insurance companies, or other insurance service companies that would create a conflict of interest with the performance of tasks under this indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (AXK) invites prospective contractors to review the Draft Request for Proposal FA8802-05-R-0003 which will be released in May 2006. An Industry Day will be held on 25 May 2006 at SMC, Bldg 270, Daedelion Room from 1430 – 1600. Please contact Capt Michael Ahn at (310) 653-1347 to RSVP. It is anticipated that the DRFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the Industry Day.

It is the intent of SMC/AXK to establish SAS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Space and Missiles Systems Center Acquisition Support by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Engineering Services (PES) 871-6 Multiple Award Schedule Contracts (Acquisition and Life Cycle Management). There is no closing date for this announcement. The NAICS Code for this action is 541710, paragraph 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. All SAS Delivery Orders will be 100% set-aside for small business participation only. SMC/AXK allows contractors to form teaming relationships for this effort. In order to receive a SAS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA FSS 871-6, PES FSS.  In order to be a qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA PES 871-6 Schedule.  The SAS requirement is for the acquisition of Acquisition Planning, manpower, Manpower, Personnel, Training and Administration, Configuration and Data Management, and Contracting Support.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be through 30 Sep 2011.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders. To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA.  In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the government.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award. Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance. The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded. The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments or the contractor's facility.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI), ST9, Sail Imaging and Monitoring System (SIMS) THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. Overview The ST9 Solar Sail Mission is one of five missions competing for selection by the New Millennium Program (NMP) for implementation and flight in 2010.  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is leading the Solar Sail Concept Definition Study team during this Phase A effort and expects to submit a Solar Sail Concept Definition Study Report in September 2006.  A Sail Imaging and Monitoring System (SIMS) will be used to take images of the solar sail, control vanes attached to the end of the sail booms, and a translation stage attached to the spacecraft bus and the sail housing.  The SIMS will monitor deployment and steady-state activities.  The images from the SIMS will be used to verify deployment, sail deployed area, sail boom geometry, and tip vane deployment and orientation. The SIMS as currently envisioned will consist of four camera attached to a camera platform mounted at the end of a deployable mast that is itself attached along the centerline of a spacecraft bus.  At launch, the SIMS must fit within a constrained volume, however, a mast height of 5 m is desired to give the proper mounting location to view the entire solar sail and its deployment.	Minimum orbital lifetime is one month, with a goal of six months. Requested Response ST9 requests that interested parties provide inputs and suggestions for the mast and/or the imaging system as to how best to image the sail, control vanes, and translating stage, during sail deployment and while the sail is fully deployed, with the following simultaneous requirements: 1.	COTS parts and processes (minimum risk, high heritage) highly desired 2.	Less than 30 watts of total steady state power (including temperature control) 3.	Less than 55 watts of peak power (including temperature control) 4.	Mast mass less than 5 kg 5.	Cameras and platform mass less than 5 kg 6.	Stowed volume less than 0.015 m^3 7.	Operating temperature -10 C to +50 C 8.	Survival temperature -20 C to +75 C 9.	Minimum 1 month lifetime in 1000 - 1500 km altitude orbit 10.	Average data rate to the ground no more than 20 kbits/sec 11.	Peak data rate to the ground no more than 2Mbits/sec 12.	Image the entire 34m x 34m sail 13.	Image the deployment sequence that occurs within 2 m of the spacecraft bus centerline 14.	Cameras must be individually powered and controlled 15.	Imaging frequency will be no greater than 1 Hz Deviations of the requirements can be considered when clearly identified with proposed alternative requirements from the RFI responder.  The goals of this RFI are to determine 1.	What is the Rough Order of Magnitude cost to meet these requirements? 2.	What individual components exist to meet imaging requirements. While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so.  It is neither a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid.  Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI. To consolidate our planning, we request responses from industry within 7 days of the release date of this RFI.  Responses can be submitted via email.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Electromagnetics Division, proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Ansoft Corporation, 225 West Station Square, Suite 200, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 for a Q3D Extractor, Node locked license with one year maintenance.

Q3D extractor performs two functions, quasi-static 2D finite element simulation, and 3D method-of-moments simulations. NIST already owns a previous version of the 2D package, spicelink SI2D, purchased in 2003, but it is unsupported by Ansoft in the standalone version, with no maintenance available. This purchase will upgrade NIST's current 2D package as well as provide additional functionality from the 3D tools.

The requested product is an upgrade to an existing electromagnetic simulation software package that has been in use in the Electromagnetics Division laboratory for the past 3 years. The software performs a vital step in NIST's research program, and the 2D analysis portion of the package is specifically designed for determining the per-unit-length transmission line properties for transmission lines of arbitrary cross-section, which can be compared directly with our measurement data. For this application, a 2D solver using finite-element analysis is crucial for obtaining the accuracy that NIST requires for use in their experimental analysis. The accuracy of this particular 2D EM simulation package has been repeatedly verified in NIST's laboratories over the past 3 years. Since this product provides the necessary accuracy as determined by extensive in-house testing, NIST has incorporated output from this software package into their current measurement analysis procedures. Since Ansoft holds the copyright for the original product, which NIST already owns, they are the only source available to obtain the required upgrade. The product from Ansoft is also the only option for upgrading the existing simulation software while maintaining backward compatibility with NIST's extensive catalog of existing models and modeling results, which are relied upon heavily in NIST's current research.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before May 31, 2006. Anticipated award date is June 5, 2006.

RESPOND TO LT COL DEREK KNIGHT VIA EMAIL AT derek.knight@randolph.af.mil.

Introduction:

This Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there are sources available that could provide HQ Air Education & Training Command (HQ AETC/A3) with a ground-based spatial disorientation trainer.  HQ AETC/A3 is soliciting vendors who will make available their ground-based trainer for closer examination by a team of AETC pilots.  It is hoped that the AETC team will find a suitable device for spatial disorientation training in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT).  

The device must be capable of creating spatial disorientation (SD) illusions while at the same time producing realistic flight simulation.  Details of the product specifications for the SD trainer are spelled out in the following paragraphs, but to qualify the vendor’s product must meet the following requirements:
1)	It must be available for purchase or recognized as a commercial-off-the-shelf product.
2)	It must be currently in use by an existing flight training program.
3)	It must be either accessible or available during a period of at least six months of calendar year 2007 to allow AETC to evaluate the device.  This evaluation would consist of examining the capabilities of the device, developing custom flight profiles and allowing a team of AETC instructor pilots to fly a series of missions to assess ability of the device to cause spatial disorientation illusions.  This evaluation could be performed at the vendor’s facility or the device could be set up at an AETC training base.

A team of AETC pilots will be assembled to examine the capability of the device.  After their examination is complete, and should the device be found acceptable for the purpose of HQ AETC/A3, the product will be then considered worthy of competing for a potential purchase of five (5) devices in 2008.  No specific MILSPEC Standards apply to this purchase.  

Vendors are to supply overall warranty information on their ground-based trainers, parts, sub-assemblies, and subcomponents; including parts warranted by individual manufacturers.  No specific warranties are directed by this solicitation.  Any expected annual maintenance costs, and any anticipated computer upgrades, are expected to be presented during the proposal stage of the acquisition process.

A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated for the possible purchase of the five (5) training devices over a period of time as established by the Government.  The first training device would be located at Randolph AFB, TX and if determined to be acceptable, the possibility of four (4) more training devices could be purchased for four (4) different Undergraduate Pilot Training base locations, on a time schedule established by USAF needs.    

Once the AETC/A3 assessment has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.eps.gov.  At present there is no time line for posting an RFP.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors’ to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors’ must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR).  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors’ shall indicate their size standard (large business, 8(a), etc) when replying to this RFI.  In your response briefly describe your company’s experience with these types of training devices or similar items, current or past contracts that deal with the aforementioned products or similar products, and any information you deem relevant.  Provide a point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS).

In addition to the flight simulation and SD illusions, this ground-based trainer must possess three basic capabilities.  The first is a motion system that can sustain continual yaw; the second is a realistic enclosed cockpit with flight instruments and controls closely similar to those of the T-6 Texan II aircraft; and the third is a user interface between the console operator and the pilot in the cockpit that allows the console operator to insert flight conditions and flight profiles either randomly or pre-program.  The pre-programmed conditions should initiate based on the flight location of the simulated aircraft.  

Specific Mandatory Specifications/Requirements/Capabilities: 

The following details explain the most important features required of the product being sought by the AETC/A3 team.

Cab or Cockpit Configuration:

	1) Cockpit Size: Any pilot candidate in the Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (JSUPT) program must be able to sit comfortably in the cockpit. In other words, if the person is of an anthropometric size to enter pilot training, then that person must be able to fit just like they would fit in the actual USAF T-6 Texan II aircraft.  
	2) Seat and rudder pedals: The seat should be adjustable in forward-backward and up-down directions.  It is highly desirable for the rudder pedals to be adjustable as well (forward-backward), and include the traditional aircraft toe-brake feature. 
	3) The cab must be light tight to produce the autokinesis illusion.  It must also contain adjustable background lighting and/or adjustable floodlights.  When needed, the entire cockpit must be able to remove any background lighting, i.e. display screens must look as if they are turned off.  
	4) Instrumentation or head-down displays must reflect the same instrument arrangement as the T-6A aircraft, as much as possible.  The detailed configuration is not required in this early assessment effort, but it will be required in the actual Request For Proposal.  If necessary, the AETC/A3 will provide photos of the T-6A instrument panel.  If this requirement cannot be met, the vendor will inform the program manager.  
5) It is desirable that several of the instruments have interactive capability; e.g. an adjustable altimeter for changes in barometric pressure altitude, an adjustable airspeed set marker, a course set knob, and a heading set knob.  Standard navigation (including instrument approaches and en-route navigation) and communication (UHF/VHF) capabilities are required.  
	6) Out-the-window (OTW) viewing scene:  The OTW viewing scene of the virtual world must be at least 100 degrees horizontal and at least 30 degrees vertical--as measured from the eyes of the pilot when his/her head is in the normal sitting flight position.  The scene itself must be of a high enough resolution so that it doesn't appear to be "jumpy" or partially rendered.  Collimation of the visual scene is not necessary.  
7) A functional Head-Up Display (HUD) must be capable of being displayed in the OTW scene.  An independent HUD is not required, but would be acceptable.  Eventually, this HUD symbology must also contain a functional flight path marker (this is not a “pitch” reference) and reflect the flight symbology as specified in MIL-STD 1787C.  This is not required for the early assessment by the AETC/A3 Team, but it will be required for the official RFP.  The HUD symbology must be capable of being removed from the scene at any time with one keystroke at the controller console.  
	8) Headset: A functional, adjustable standard headset must be incorporated in the cab.  Constant communication to the console operator is a requirement.
	9) Camera: An infrared camera for observing the pilot in the cab is required.
	10) Night-vision Goggle (NVG) compatibility:  A desirable feature is that of being able to use a NVG when flying the ASAT.

Motion Platform:

	1) The motion platform must be able to produce six degrees of freedom (DoF) motion--pitch, bank, yaw, heave, surge and sway.  Pitch motion must be at least +/- 20 degrees from level.  Bank must be at least +/- 20 degrees, and yaw must be capable of sustaining constant rotation in either direction (sustained yaw is considered to be more than +/- 360 degrees).  Linear displacement is not specified but the device is required to produce momentary accelerations in the linear displacement directions.  These are minimum acceptable criteria.  
	2) The motion platform must be a stand-alone installation that does not require bolting to the floor.  
	3) Standard 220 AC (3 phase) electrical requirements are recommended, but if more (or unique power) is required, this must be brought to the attention of the AETC/A3 Team leader.  
	4) Sub-threshold motion in pitch, roll and yaw is required, as well as in linear displacement.  General displacement and motion requirements are summarized in the Table I.  

TABLE I. Motion Requirements
Degree of Freedom	DisplacementRequirement	VelocityRequirement	AccelerationRequirement
Pitch	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Roll	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Yaw	Continuous	0.5 – 120 °/sec	0.5 – 10 °/sec²
Heave (if provided)	+/- 10 cm	0.5 – 40 cm/sec	Acceptable turbulence characteristics
Surge	Not specified	Not specified	Not specified
Sway	Not specified 	Not specified	Not specified



Console (workstation):

1) A minimum size of 17-inch color monitors for all displays at the workstation are required.  The display surface should be shielded from overhead lights.
2) The graphical user interface should contain multiple features.  Control of the imagery is critical.  Features like time-of-day, in-flight visibility and associated changes of in-flight visibility, fog conditions, ceilings, in and out of cloud effects, are all necessary.  
3) In addition, individual pre-programming of the motion is required from the console workstation, and pre-programming of many visual features leading to spatial disorientation, e.g., sloping cloud deck, false horizon, should be available for quick access by the instructor at the console.  
4) It is absolutely critical to allow for pre-programmable “conditional” events to occur.  Conditional events are those motion and visual changes, which happen at a pre-determined point in space when the simulated aircraft reaches this point, or at a specific run time in the simulator space-time world.  This important feature will be discussed further at the request of potential vendors.
5) The cockpit instrumentation must be controlled at the workstation by the instructor.  This means any and all of the flight instruments will have a feature where they can be frozen, blanked, or removed at the discretion of the console operator.  These features must be tied into the conditional event feature.  In other words, the console operator must be able to either freeze an instrument whenever he/she desires to do it, or the same event (e.g., freezing the instrument) can occur at a pre-programmed conditional event.
6) The console operator must be able to move the aircraft throughout the database in the traditional three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude) with the aid of a cursor.  The “click and drag” feature for latitude and longitude position will suffice.  Altitude changes via another feature are desired.
7) Recording of the simulator profile is desired, but not required.  However, the capability to display, record, and print an ILS approach is required (in both glide slope and localizer).  Please provide a list of cost options for various levels of recording capabilities as part of your response. 

Specialized Features:

1) The product must be able to generate acceptable SD illusions of both vestibular or visual origins and combinations of both sensory types (i.e. vestibular and visual).  Acceptable illusions will be decided by the AETC/A3 Team of experts during the assessment.
2) As mentioned earlier, NVG integration is desired but not required.  It is a feature needed for future applications and the team would like to determine the potential of integrating NVG into the training curriculum.  If this cannot be accomplished, the AETC/A3 Team would like to know the problems associated with this feature, e.g., technical problems and expense to implement   
3) Although the distributed mission training concept (i.e., linking several devices together via the LAN) is not a requirement, AETC would like to know about the feasibility and cost of this technology.
4) The workstation must be able to generate formation profiles so the operator in the cab can fly with the virtual lead aircraft.  Simulated air refueling is also a desired but not required feature.

Somers, Telephone  (843) 218-5976; Fax (843) 218-5963 Description:  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Charleston intends to negotiate, on a sole-source basis, with Metadata(r)  Company LLC, (DBA) The Metadata(r)  Company, 444 W Ocean Blvd., Suite 1600, Long Beach CA 90802-4524.  The contractor shall provide services to investigate the use of Virtual Data Retrieval Tool (VDRT), which is a component of Contractor's Proprietary Software, in a systems environment that will support Critical Infrastructure Protection Center (CIPC's) functionality requirements and operating environment.  This investigation is intended to result in a demonstration prototype that acquires data from remote data sources in a format compatible with CIPC's analytical tools.  Virtual data retrieval in this context means the importation of specific data from different remote sources in response to a query, with data import occurring at the time of the query, merging the data in a unified database using The Metadata(r)  Company's unique data language and, creating merged output of data that are compatible with CIPC's analytical tools. The demonstration prototype model will be developed based on requirements that were previously established. The model will be integrated into the Critical Infrastructure Protection Center's Collaborative Information Warfare Network (CIWN).  This award expands upon the 2004 and 2005 metadata model development and proof of concept of a unified database management platform that can be integrated into the following CIWN nodes: 1. Visual Links/Analyzer 2. Neural Solutions 3. Web-Enabled Service Oriented Architecture 4. General GUI Interfaces The Metadata(r) Company intellectual property and system provide CIPC with capabilities and efficiencies based on The Metadata(r) Company's unique data modeling language.  The Metadata(r) Company's system is based on the data modeling language and provides data management capabilities not found elsewhere in the marketplace.  The Metadata(r) Company's technology provides CIPC with the capability to incrementally build a data model and database system without the need to continually redesign the database as additional data and interoperability requirements are identified. The Metadata(r) Company has patents pending on its intellectual property, including several components of its systems.  A Firm Fixed Price type contract is anticipated.  This Notice of Intent is NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.    The applicable NAICS Code is 541511 and FSC Code 7025 applies.  Comments shall be submitted in writing to Ron Kennedy, Code 0271RK, Contract Specialist, telephone number (843) 218-5820; e-mail address  ronald.kennedy@navy.mil.  NOTE 22 APPLIES.......

<SUBJECT>70 -- Sole Source Notification
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for RoboBike Software, Hardware and Support to MicroFit, 1077B Independence Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043.  The software, hardware, and Maintenance Support needs to be maintained in order for it to keep supporting the Health and Wellness Centers mission.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because MicroFit is the developer of software and hardware and own the proprietary rights to the drawings needed for support of the RoboBike.  The procurement of this maintenance for the hardware and software support must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements.  Questions should be directed to Jason M. King in writing via email: jason.king@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 294-7280.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION: 55th Contracting Squadron (ACC), 101 Washington Square, Offutt AFB NE 68113-2107.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: Request approval to use other than full and open competition procedures to solicit and award a contract for the acquisition of RoboBike attachments for three cycle ergometry bikes required by the Health and Wellness Center for the Air Force Fitness Program at Offutt AFB.  

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The specific purchase requirements are for the following:

Three RoboBike attachments + shipping, 1 year service contracts for each, and installation/training (if possible).  

The RoboBike attachments are required to connect the actual exercise bikes to the computer which uses the AF supplied software, FitSoft.   All of these parts are required to conduct AF mandated cycle ergometry testing.  Ergometry testing must be accomplished when an individual is medically profiled from the 1.5 mile run portion of the AF fitness test.  The HAWC’s ErgoCycle Center has been inoperable since 30 March 2006 due to software and hardware problems that are own biomechanics and computer specialists could not repair along with input from the maker of the product.  Both the ACC Health Promotion Director and the maker of the product advised replacing the current MicroFit component with the RoboBike updgrade to solve the issue.  Service contracts need to be purchased so the HAWC can receive immediate help when cycle systems are not working properly.  Personal installation and training would be best to ensure our systems work appropriately, but if a representative from MicroFit cannot schedule a time quickly enough to meet our needs, we can receive directions by phone.  If we are unable to install the equipment on our own, then we will have to wait on a MicroFit rep’s availability.  

IV.	AUTHORITY: 10 U. S. C. 2304(c)(1) as stated in FAR 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  

APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: The RoboBike components are manufactured and sold only by MicroFit, Inc.  MicroFit RoboBike has been approved and recommended for use by the AF Surgeon General’s office since September 2002.  To my knowledge, no systems other than those manufactured by MicroFit can be used in conjunction with the AF’s FitSoft software.  

V.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Similar fitness assessment equipment may exist, but none are supported by FitSoft.  FitSoft is no longer being funded or upgraded by the Air Force and so attempting to manipulate the software to work with another system would take an unknown amount of time to obtain funding and then more time to find additional hardware/software compatibility.  Due to this, it is not advantageous to the government to obtain competition for system upgrades.

VI.	PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLE:  Determination of price fair and reasonable is being made on the basis of MicroFit’s price quote and open market pricing of similar equipment.  Cost comparison can only be approximated owing to the fact that MicroFit’s equipment is of their own exclusive design and they do not utilize resellers or distributors.

VII.	MARKET SURVEY:  MicroFit, Inc., is currently in use, and has been approved through appropriate AF channels

VIII.	OTHER FACTS: None.

IX.	INTERESTED SOURCES: None known

X.	STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: If future acquisitions are required, a market survey will be conducted to determine if other sources have developed a capability to provide us with the required services.  

XI.	TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENT PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION: Any supporting data pertaining to this acquisition that is the responsibility of the technical requirements personnel, and which form a basis for the justification, have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

XII.	CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer’s signature on the Justification Review Document represents certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer’s knowledge and belief.

<SUBJECT>--Market Survey RSCH-2006-04(15775) Innovative JP-8 Fuel Desulfurization Development
<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on in formation requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) of Warren, Michigan is issuing this market survey to identify sources and availability of novel or unconventional desulfurization processes capable of desulfurizing a high  sulfur JP-8 fuel (liquid or gas phase) which would be suitable as a fuel stream for reforming the JP-8 into a hydrogen-rich reformate. Sulfur levels in JP-8 range from 250 to 3000 parts per million (ppm) and must be efficiently removed to low levels estim ated to be less than 1 ppm to minimize or eliminate poisoning and fouling of the reforming catalysts or conversely, a post desulfurization process to eliminate or minimize poisoning the fuel cell stack. TARDEC is interested in developing unconventional fuel desulfurizers that can scrub the fuel to be cleaner, last longer, and occupy a smaller volume. It is the intent of this survey to gain information which may be utilized to facilitate the finalization o f a requirement. The information gathered as a result of this survey will contribute to the decision as to how we approach this acquisition.  RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the Market Survey are requested no later then 20 days after announcement post and should not exceed 8 pages of text. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC:  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point.  The maximum size of each e-mail sh ould be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organi zations, and academic institutes), regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Please submit electronic responses and any questions prior to full response to Dan Maslach via email at dan.maslach.us.army.mil.  Please form at the subject line of the response email as follows; [Organization Name] response to RSCH-2006-04.  A questionnaire for the Market Survey 2006-04(15775) will be posted to PROC-NET (http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm). GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Govern ment is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:          1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately prote cted.        2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected       3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another  party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,         4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the  beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.       5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.       6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will pre clude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

Evaluation Criteria

The Government anticipates awarding a task order to the vendor whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described below.  Delivery & Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made other than the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal.  Price proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described in Section B.

The Government, at its discretion, may award this task without discussions.

Vendors shall identify and document all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions upon which the technical part of this proposal is based.  All assumptions (both technical and price) shall be included in the proposal.

A.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors.

 	Past Performance
  	Delivery       				

Assumptions, Conditions, and Exceptions will be reviewed for acceptability and potential impact on information provided in the task order proposal.

	1.  Delivery

	The Government is seeking to determine the speed of delivery.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of the delivery proposal from the vendor. 

	2.  PAST PERFORMANCE

	If the vendor has no single experience that encompasses all types of past performance defined in the sub-factors below, the Offeror may show past performance through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this SOW.  The past performance information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.

	Past performance that is technically relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	Vendors will be evaluated on examples of past performance wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.
	A lack of relevant past performance data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.
	Past performance will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the SOW.
	Each proposal is required to describe a minimum of two but not more than five prior relevant projects that have been completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this SOW.   Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
	Past performance is relevant to the support required for the task order.  Deliverables must meet contract requirements technical excellence, timing, budgeting and report accuracy.  Management must be effective with flexible and responsive staffing with no performance problems or deficiencies that impact task quality, time or cost.  Vendor must meet all requirements in overall satisfaction to end-users.

B.  PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION.  Vendors’ price proposal will be evaluated to determine price reasonableness.  Vendors’ technical and price proposals will be evaluated in determining best value to the Government.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

11.  CLEANUP AND DISPOSAL:
11.1.  Cleanup: The industrial hygienist shall certify, in writing, that the concentration of airborne asbestos in the regulated area and the waste container removal system are less than 0.01 fibers (longer than 5-micrometers) per cubic centimeter of air and that there are no visible accumulation of dust. Do not remove the asbestos regulated area enclosure (or roped-off perimeter) and warning signs prior to the Government representative's receipt of the industrial hygienist's certification. The Government representative will visually inspect the affected surfaces for residual asbestos material and accumulated dust before and after the removal of the asbestos regulated area. The Contractor shall re-clean areas showing dust or residual asbestos materials. If re-cleaning is required, monitor the asbestos airborne concentration after re-cleaning. Notify the Government representative before unrestricted entry is permitted. The Government shall have the option to perform independent monitoring to certify the areas are safe before entry is permitted.
11.2.  Removal of Asbestos Waste Containers: Asbestos waste containers shall not be removed through the change rooms. The waste containers removal system shall consist of a wash-down station inside the asbestos regulated area, a washroom, and a waste container holding
regulated areas. The waste container removal systems shall be a temporary unit constructed to prevent the escape of asbestos fibers from the area. The system shall be physically attached to the asbestos regulated area. Personnel entering the waste container removal system shall wear personal protective equipment. The system shall not be used to enter or exit the work site. Access to outside the waste container removal system shall be sealed except during the removal of asbestos waste containers. Perform cleanup of the waste container removal system as specified herein for enclosed asbestos regulated areas. Do not remove the waste container removal system enclosure and warning signs prior to the Government representative's receipt of the industrial hygienist's cleanup certification.
11.3.  Disposal of Asbestos: Once the bags of asbestos containing materials have been removed from the work area, they shall be loaded into an enclosed truck for transportation to a state and federal approved landfill. Waste containers shall be placed on the ground at the disposal site, not pushed or thrown out of enclosed trucks. Procedures for hauling and disposal shall comply with 40 CFR 61, Subpart M, and state standards.

FA8604-06-R-7920 AFSC Questions & Answers



1.  In Section 4.2 of the Information to Offerors, do you want Past Performance information on 3-5 recent contracts for the whole team; or 3-5 contracts for the prime and then 3-5 contracts for each subcontractor/teaming partner? 
Answer:  The whole team.  See Section L, Instructions to Offerors, Revised Section 4.0 Volume III- Relevant Past Performance  

 2.  The Synopsis indicates the NAICS code is 611512 - Flight Training.  Previous solicitations for this type of training were classified NAICS 611430 - Professional Development Training.  Is the cited NAICS correct? 
Answer:  The NAIC Code is changed FROM:  611512 Flight Training
TO:  611430 Professional Development Training
3.  Reference Part I - The Schedule, page 2.  CLIN 0004 indicates the SATP (FSO) course to be estimated at 226 hours.  Respective CLINs 1004, 2004, and 3004 are estimated at 302 hours for the same course.  Is there to be a substantial change in the SATP course beginning in Option year 1 or are the hours in the Base Year (CLIN 0004) in error? Answer: Solicitation has been corrected to reflect and estimated 226 hours for all CLINs 0004, 1004, 2004, and 3004.
4.  Reference the Performance Work Statement, paragraphs, 2 and 2.3.
a. The PWS indicates the contractor may be required to "complete all work associated with the layout of new exhibits."  This most likely means using extensive manpower and equipment.  Will the government provide any necessary heavy equipment? Answer:  Yes, the intent of the PWS paragraph 2.3 is that the contractor would apprise AFSC/SEME what of heavy equipment required and duration. AFSC SEME would then arrange to provide support.
b. Additionally, it is difficult to estimate the level of effort required as mishap exhibits may be simple pieces of wreckage, a small aircraft, or a large aircraft.  Each requires different manpower requirements.  How is the contractor to estimate the level of effort for this type of work? Answer: The contractor would estimate labor hours for the specific task as they occur. 
c. Lastly, there is no CLIN identified for estimating either a firm-fixed price, establishing a level of effort for which identified relates to a variable man-hour requirement, or lastly a reimbursable expenditure.  How are we to report this contract requirement? Answer:  The CLIN was inadvertently omitted.  The solicitation has been amended to include the appropriate CLIN.  See revised CLIN 0005, 1005, 2005, 3005
5.  PWS, paragraph 2.1 indicates that the government will develop and maintain all training materials.  Does this mean reproduction will be limited to the government materials listed and that there will be no need for the contractor to independently create presentation materials and/or outlines and handouts? Answer:  Yes
6.  Section L, Page 5, Paragraph 4.2:
Please confirm that we are interpreting this correctly:

The offer’s team is to submit 3 to 5 Past Performances, on the attachment 1 Past Performance Information Sheet and including the Questionnaire. These 3 to 5 should be what we, as a team, determine is the most relevant. As an example, we may submit 3 from the prime contractor and 2 from the subcontractor(s). Answer:  Same as question #1 above.

Secondly, if there are other Past Performances that we deem relevant and are not included in the 3-5 selected above, we can submit the Past Performance Information Sheet on these, but would not do the Questionnaire. Answer:  Same as question #1 above.

7.  Section L, Attachment 1, Page 2, Item I? What is meant by “instant acquisition”? Answer:  “instant acquisition” pertains to this current acquisition the offeror is proposing on.

8.  PWS, paragraph 2.0 and 2.1: Are we correct in reading this that the contractor is not   required to develop or update any curriculum, examinations, or critiques – that this is performed by the government? The contractor performs only the delivery/teach” ISD function. 
Answer:  Yes

9.  Are the estimates for ODCs maximum amounts?
Answer:  No, they are estimates.

10.  PWS Appendix E1—There is no human factors training block in the AMI course.  Is this oversight or is human factors no longer deemed a part of investigation?
Answer:  Human Factors is included in the course even though it is not a separate block.

11. Will platform instructors be allowed to supplement the government provided course materials during their platform instruction with video clips, add slides to enhance the materials as long as they follow the lesson plans?
Answer:  No.  However the contractor may make recommendations to AFSC/SEME for consideration of inclusion of materials.

12.  Define Deviation as per PWS paragraph 3, Service Delivery Summary.
Answer:  Anything that differs from the PWS requirements.

13.  PWS Appendix E3—Safety privilege is part of SPM in the PWS.  Would the government consider moving this to the AMI course where it seems more applicable, since it is used during investigation?
Answer:  Correction.  Safety Privilege will be included in the AMI course.

14.  PWS—does the government plan to specify number of hours dedicated to each subject in each course?
Answer:  Yes, the government will designate blocks of time per subject area which will be included in the training materials supplied to the successful offeror.

15.  To what extent will the contractor be expedited to adhere to the GFE training provided?  Answer:  100%.  Anecdotal examples/illustrations may vary.  
In other words, as conditions and source information changes (AFIs, changing missions, new technologies) who will be responsible for integrating these changes into the courseware? (Ref RFP para. 2.1)
Answer:  The Government.

16.  Will the Microsoft Outlook Scheduler use requirement be extended to scheduling all classrooms/instructors in addition to the computer room? (Ref RFP para 2.2.1.1)
Answer:  AFSC/SEME will schedule classrooms; however, the contractor may use the Microsoft Outlook Scheduler to schedule their instructors if so desired.

17.  What are the “SDS” references?  (Ref RFP para 2.21.7)
Answer:  Reference to items listed in the PWS paragraph 3.

18.  What constitutes “oral feedback” in the post-exam review?  (Ref RFP para 2.2.1.10)
Answer:  An example would be the use of discussion to determine reason for high missed question(s).

19.  Ref RFP para 2.2.1.12 states that no other feedback instrument is authorized other than the end-of-course critique.  Does this preclude internal contractor methodologies that will not be billed to the government? (Ref RFP para 2.2.1.12)
Answer:  Yes; however, in accordance with PWS para. 2.2.1.12, the contractor has input to the development of the feedback instrument.

20.  Appendix E, Item 19 asks for the “definition of AFI 91-204”.  Please clarify.
Answer: The Government furnished training materials supplied to the successful offeror will have sufficient detail.








21.  Section H – Special Contract Requirements
H023 Indefinite Quantity – The maximum and minimum dollar amounts that the government may order is not filled in.
Answer:  Corrected- See amendment 0001 of the solicitation for fill-ins.
Section I – Contract Clauses
52.216-19 (a) Minimum order and (b) Maximum Order quantities are not filled in.
Answer:  Same as above
What are the maximum and minimum numbers of classes that will be ordered for the base year and for the option years if they are exercised?
Answer:  Same as above

22.  Section L-III Information to Offeror (ITO) and Instructions for Proposal Preparation
5.1.3. Cost of Pricing Information Requirement requests “The estimate should identify the makeup of the unit price.” 
5.2 Volume Organization Section 2 requires “Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology.

Both these clauses appear to conflict with Section L046 Submission of Cost or Pricing Data which states “offerors are not required to submit cost of pricing data”. I realize that the Government has the right to request cost/pricing data at a later date to ensure price reasonableness. Section B – Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs requests unit prices. Is the breakdown of how the unit prices were calculated or any other cost/pricing data required to be included in Volume IV? 
Answer:  As stated in the solicitation, Cost or Pricing is not required at this time; however, the requirements in Section L, Instructors to Offerors, Section 5.0 Volume IV Cost/Price are still valid.  Paragraph 5.1.3, second paragraph has been revised for clarification.

23.  Page 24 of 28 - Section I - FAR Clauses in full text
52.217-08
Option to extend services
Second sentence refers to "revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor."  

Is this a Service Contract Act Contract governed by the DOL rates?  If so, which Area Wage Determination will be incorporated into this contract?
Answer:  No, this is not a requirement governed by the Service Contract Act.

24.  How are exams administered and graded? 
ANSWER:  Knowledge based examinations will be paper-based and administered in the classroom.  The knowledge based exams are predominately multiple choice questions and a scatter gram answer key will be provided to grade the student responses



25.  Are exams taken on the computers in the computer lab?
Answer:  Any examinations administered for the performance based objectives will be given at the performance location (e.g.. classroom or crash lab).  Checklists for grading the performance based exams will be provided.

26.  What is your expectation (hours per week) for the contractor’s Project Manager to consult/meet with Air Force Safety Center staff? 
ANSWER:  There is no set amount.  It would be on as-needed-basis.  Some weeks may require zero to none other weeks may be 1-2 hours.  There may be more of a need during the base year and taper off in out years.  The Program Manager is expected to be part of the instructor cadre (reference PWS paragraph 4.2.1), and interaction with the AFSC/SEME staff would be accomplished during a traditional 8-hour day.  Best estimate might average 1 hour per week.  However, this is a performanced based requirement and the offeror can propose how much time is needed.
 
 27.  For Volume I, II, and III, is the Table of Contents included in the page limit?
ANSWER:  As per SECTION L, paragraph 1.2.1 Page Limitations, the table of content pages is NOT included in the page limits

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 0001 TO SOLICITATION NO. W911QY-06-R-0525 Here are some questions and answers to solicitation no. W911QY-06-R-0525.  1) Is there currently an incumbent on this program? No 2) Is this a small business set aside?  This is a full and open competition. 3) We see this proposal response as pretty straight forward.  Our view on the formal proposal response is that it would have to include the following items:  a) Labor cost for support personnel for appox. 1248 hrs LOE : with option line item pricing for 4 years b) Travel costs (estimated at 5 trips)  c) Any anticipated ODC costs if any  d) Administrative costs for the contract. Are we interpreting your direction correctly?  3.It also needs to include a technical proposal and resumes. 4 Travel: The government has listed a number of locations that the contractor will have to travel to, with the duration specified for each visit. A bid amount needs to be provided for the base award term, and for all option periods for all offerors to use in their proposal. It is impractical to expect an offeror to be able to submit a reasonable price for travel when travel dates are unknown. Is RDECOM Acquisition Center going to provide all potential offers with a bid amount for travel that can be included  in each offerors proposal?    4. Answer:  The price of the travel is an estimated amount quoted by the offerors.  The statement of work does contain how many trips and how long each trip will last. 5. Government Furnished Property/Information: Is any of the documentation provided to the contractor classified? If so, will the Government provide the approporiate storage container to the contractor? 5. Answer:  No, there will be no classified documents provided, so there will be not requirement for storing classified documents. 6. Period of Performance: The soliciation indicate that the contractor will provide services averaging 24 hours per week. Does this amount, 24 hours per week, apply to all of the option years also? 6. Answer:  Yes 7. Reps and Certs: If the offeror has completed ORCA, and as prescriped in FAR 52.212-3, section (j), how are these updates or certification submitted with the proposal, electronically or by mail?   7. Answer: Electronically is fine.  8.Is there an incumbent for this effort? If yes, what is the name of the company and business size?  No 9.For labor hours  should we estimate based on 24 hour work week per solicitation? Yes 10.Will the contractor staff be required to be on-site? Yes Response time is 25 May 2006, 5:00 P.M. EST.  Point of contact is Kathy Wilder. E-Mail address is: Kathy.Wilder@natick.army.mil
