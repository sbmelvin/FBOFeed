<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, through the Program Support Center (PSC)plans to award a unique sole source fixed price simplified acquisition to Medical Care Section, American Public Health Association (APHA), 1050 Wishard Boulevard, Indianapolis, IN 46202. The Medical Care Section of the APHA is the only organization that has access to all the relevant research information and topics are experts in the field to accomplish this task.  The purpose of this acquisition is to assemble a set of significant papers devoted to the delivery of health care services to persons with HIV disease.  These papers will focus on what we know and what we need to know about the impact of various financial incentives, organizational arrangement and market environments on the delivery of health care services to persons with HIV disease.  As the number of person living with HIV disease is increasing and as the cost of drug therapy is increasing(e.g., the new fusion-inhibitor that was just recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Fuzeon, cost $20,000 wholesales and almost $30,000 retail per person per year) issues surrounding the delivery of health care services to persons with HIV infection are becoming more important.  Dissemination of this information to a broad audience of researchers is critical to furthering AHRQ’s mission to improve health care through dissemination of research on health care cost, quality, access and use.  This project is to manage all aspects of editorial review and electronic coding for the set of 6-9 papers that focus on what we need to know about the impact of various financial incentives, organizational arrangements and market environments on the quality of cost of health services. THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES AND SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302.  INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. For Further Information, Please Contact Julia Savoy in Rm 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md 20857 or 0n 301-443-2475 OR BY EMAIL jsavoy@psc.gov.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is seeking to identify a firm with a national reputation for successful work with large groups of  diversified key stakeholders.  The firm must have evidence of its work in needs assessments and action plans in the chronic disease arena  focused on documenting health needs, guiding public health programs and policies,  prioritizing health interventions, appropriation and utilization of funding, prevention barriers, and eliminating disparities in health, including the impact of psychological and physiological factors on intervention outcomes.  In the essence of time, it is essential the firm have access to a data collection and analyzation tool that allows for a short turn-around in gathering data from stakeholders on several continents.  Activities must minimize participant burden, and integrate high quality multivariate analyses and generate products that can be utilized to affect a broad impact in multiple settings.  A Public Health Action Plan to Prevent Heart Disease and Stroke is the initiative launched by the HHS Secretary in April 2003 to chart a course for CDC, with the States and Territories and our other Partners, for achieving national goals for heart disease and stroke prevention over the next two decades, to 2010 and 2020.  CDC is committed to this important initiative and assumes a leadership role in  full implementation of the Action Plan.  This firm should be adept at the utilization of concept mapping.  The concept mapping technique for this project should be designed to work with a diversity of public, private, and governmental organizations, and must include a mechanism for aggregating ideas across individuals, and utilizing statistical analytic methods that yield group maps that have metric properties of value in evaluation and outcome assessments.  Should a firm outside of the immediate Atlanta, Georgia area be identified for this project, all travel must be of the most economic means and must be pre-approved by the technical monitor for this project.  The solicitation with statement of work will be available within 24 hours.

<DESC>The government intends to conduct sole-source negotiations for privatizing the water, wastewater, natural gas and electric utility distribution systems at Peterson AFB, Colorado.  The intended contract awardee is Colorado Springs Utilities.  Colorado Springs Utilities, an entity of the City of Colorado Springs, has a sixty-year history of providing certain utility services to Peterson AFB.  The decision to award on a sole-source basis was based on following facts:  (1) The government leases part of the land comprising Peterson AFB from the City of Colorado Springs.  (2) The City of Colorado Springs owns a significant portion of the land housing the pipes and wires of the distribution systems.  Consequently, the federal government does not possess uncontroverted authority to grant Rights of Way or easements for purposes of accessing the utility distribution systems.  (3) The components of the distribution systems have been housed in such a way, over the sixty-year period, that federal government and City of Colorado Springs ownership are, to a significant degree, inseparable or indistinguishable.  The contract will be awarded for up to fifty years. The contract will be for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the water, wastewater, natural gas and electric utility distribution systems.  Access will be granted through execution of Right of Ways, and transfers of title will occur through the execution of Bills of Sale.  The O&M contract will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The transfers of property and grants of access are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688.  Colorado Springs Utilities will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, to obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, to possess the financial resources necessary to provide operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems, and to possess the financial resources required for capital improvements.  The Point of Contact is Ms. Diane Stout, Contracting Specialist, Phone: (719) 554-2840, Fax: (719) 554-2744, e-mail:  diane.stout@peterson.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric chemical kinetics division has a requirement for a pulsed laser system for use in chemical kinetics experiments in our laboratories.  This laser system will be used for photolysis of precursor molecules to produce radicals of interest (e.g. OH, HCO, C1, ETC.)in atmospheric chemistry.  The requirements are: 1) The pulse energies at all excimer wavelengths have to be greater than 20 mJ; 2) It has to be easy to switch between the wavelengths repeatedly without permanent energy loss due to passivation effects;  3) The laser has to be mobile enough to be transported to the different experimental setups in the laboratory; 4) This gives an upper limit on the weight of 70 kg, and on the overall dimensions of the laser of 150 cmx50cmx50cm; 5) In order to maintain fairly constant pulse energies over the course of a full experimental day, the gas lifetime has to be high enough to support 1 million pulses without decreasing in energy more than 50%; 6) The system must also have a low beam divergence of smaller than 2mRad to enable longer path lengths of the laser beam; and 7) The system mus carry a warranty (typically 1 year on parts and 90 days on optics) and must be easily serviceable within the United States.  It is the intent of the Government to award this procurement on a sole source basis under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) with GAM Laser of Orlando, FL.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100,000).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  No award will be made on the basis of requests in response to this notice. Terms & Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/#REFERENCE. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. These are the complete specifications and no RFQ is available.  All technical questions shall be addressed to
A. R. Ravishankara of NOAA at 303 497-5821.  This RFQ will expire August 18, 2003.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) is investigating the development and suitability of a software-based open-architecture for space-based reconfigurable transceivers (RT) and software defined radios (SDR) to enable advanced operations and reduce mission costs. Software defined radios are becoming more common due to the capability of reconfigurable digital signal processing technologies such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and digital processors,  placing radio functions in firmware and software that were traditionally performed with analog hardware components.	Features of this communications architecture of interest include non-proprietary open standards, and application programming interfaces to enable software reuse and portability, independent hardware and software development, and hardware and software functional separation. The Joint Tactical Radio System’s (JTRS) Software Communication Architecture (SCA) is an example of an open-architecture software defined radio system currently under development for terrestrial-based, tactical radios.  The JTRS is a Department of Defense (DoD) program to develop a family of multi-mode, multi-band programmable radios based on a common, open architecture. Currently, the program has requirements for systems operating from 2 MHz to 2 GHz with recent extensions to 55 GHz SATCOM terminals with wideband waveforms. NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for a study and modeling effort which will explore the technologies, cost, benefits, and risks to establish an open-architecture for reconfigurable transceivers and software defined radios for NASA, possibly leveraging or extending the JTRS SCA or its approach for use in space. A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about August 15, 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about September 16, 2003. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is      http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=22	    Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.	It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.   All contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>1.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) 118328 and this number shall be referenced on all quotes.  This RFQ is issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) under Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 421490.  The provisions and clauses incorporated are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  This notice may result in a multiple award for a Firm-Fixed Price, one-time buy, based on a Best Value determination for CLIN 0001 Automated Palm Print Identification Systems (APISs) and a single award for CLIN 0002  File Conversion Services.  Both items shall be commercially available. Offerors may quote on both items or just one of the items.  The Counterterrorism and Forensic Science Research Unit (CTFSRU) of the FBI Laboratory Division (LD) has a requirement for multiple commercially available, nondevelopmental APISs.  Only one system will be purchased per manufacturer.  Quote shall be for a quantity of one for the APIS. The purpose of this acquisition is to assess the current state of this technology and perform tests on a variety of commercially available software and hardware based palm print systems.  The FBI LD, will utilize the results of this research to make recommendations for technical specifications to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division required for APIS functionality in the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS).  Inclusion of APIS technology into IAFIS would greatly assist in all types of field investigations.  Access to multiple platforms and algorithms is required in order to assess the current state of this technology and advance the development of APIS systems as needed for functionality with IAFIS.  These systems will be stand alone computer based systems.  These APIS systems function as analytical instruments for image capture and analysis of very fine details of palm prints and will be used in internal Research and Development.  In addition to the acquisition of APIS hardware and software, file conversion services are required to support this effort.  In order to perform the requisite tests on these systems, the FBI Laboratory requires the conversion of major case print files from inked images on cards to 1000 dpi digital images, in ANSI NIST EFTS format.  These files need to be converted only once, because this standard file format can be read by all commercially available APIS systems.  The major case print file consists of approximately 100,000 individuals with the following number of cards per individual: one ten print fingerprint card, one two print palm card, and variable number (one to four, but typically two) fully rolled finger cards.  File conversion service will be a single award.  Quotations for file conversion services should be listed separately from the APIS system. Technical Requirements:  In order to meet the needs of the associated research projects, the purchased systems must meet the following specifications.  GENERAL:  1.  Must provide a data base size up to 100,000 records. A record exists for one individual and consists of an image for each palm (at a minimum, from interdigital area at juncture with fingers to base of wrist), and extreme side of each palm (hypothenar area).  OPTION: In addition to above, includes tip of fingers to base of wrist. OPTION:  In addition to all of above, includes fully rolled impressions of all three joints of the finger, extreme tips of the fingers, and extreme sides of the fingers for all three joints.

NOTE: The average record contains six cards consisting of two palm prints (one each for left and right), and four cards containing fully rolled fingerprints of all three joints, extreme sides of these three joints and the extreme tip area for each finger. Some of these records contain images on both sides. Many records exceed six cards. Most records are recorded on 8 inches x 8 inches cards; however, some are recorded on 8.5 inches x 11 inches paper; 2.  Must support database images of 1000 ppi with no compression.  OPTION:  In addition to above, support images of 500 ppi, with no compression or lossless compression. OPTION:  In addition to all of the above, scan at a resolution greater than 1000 ppi; 3. Must be able to convert images from digital media. Proposal must state acceptable media and format. Note: Images on digital media may require segmentation to distinguish between palm prints and other images (see note under requirement Number 1 above); 4. Must support unique identifiers for each record and image; 5.  Must provide means to convert from digital data and provide data entry function for record textual data, e.g., name, sex, race, date of birth, crime or crimes, social security number, palm print classification, fingerprint classification.

Note: This functionality must be available at any time an image or images are presented during any capability throughout the entire system; 11.  Images must be oriented in an upright position, i.e., interdigital area at top of image.  Note: If palm print images on digital media appear on their sides or upside down (or any degree less than upright), then the system must automatically orient the palm print in an upright position; 12.  Must provide capability to scan images of inked prints at sizes other than 8 inches x 8 inches, at a minimum up to 8.5 inches x 14 inches; ENCODE 13.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, on a sole source basis a firm fixed price award to Summit Health Institute for Research and Education, Inc. (SHIRE), 440 First Street N.W., Suite 440 Washington, DC  20001.  The project is entitled “Intergenerational Faith-based Diabetes Prevention and Self Management Education Program for Use in the African American Community”.  The purpose of the project is to contribute to the elimination of health disparities with regard to diabetes prevalence, complications, and medical treatment experienced by African American Medicare beneficiaries in Montgomery County, Maryland.  The goals are to help diabetics, who are enrolled in Medicare, attain improved health status.  Second goal is to seek the institutionalization of this intergenerational pilot project in faith-based community-based organization serving Medicare enrollees in the county.  The following objectives are envisioned: 1) Ensure the availability of an informed youth corps to assist Medicare beneficiaries in effectively detecting, managing and controlling diabetes. 2) Establish, maintain and support one-on-one health-promoting relationships between participating youth and seniors. 3) Engage and work cooperatively with two faith-based organizations and their health ministries in developing, conducting and evaluating the project. 4) Provide a “how-to” monograph, which describes the lessons learned and outcomes. 5) Sponsor countywide health forum involving youth and seniors about the importance of diabetes management, with on-site screening and a 40 percent follow-up 3-months and 6-months after the health forum. 6) Provide pre and posttests.  SHIRE has established a sterling reputation for engaging communities for the delivery of health promotion and disease prevention services.  SHIRE projects implemented with HHS support include: the organization of Diabetes Action Teams (DATs) in five states focused on community-wide approach for use by DATs in assessing and documenting their progress and outcomes; and development of HIV/AIDS materials on rapid testing targeted to pregnant at-risk Latino/Hispanic and African American women and their health providers.  These materials have been distributed and technical assistance has been provided in Baltimore City and Prince George’s county, Maryland, as well as in the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands.  SHIRE’s work in developing community partnerships has also been extensive.  In Howard County, Maryland, SHIRE has been responsible for planning, with the support of a private foundation to aid children and youth in choosing health-related careers.  SHIRE has also convened statewide forum on diabetes, cardiovascular disease and depression, with a focus on strategies for prevention and early detection.  SHIRE has also engaged in community consultation and strategic planning that has resulted in the formation of countywide multicultural health promotion campaigns in Texas and Maryland.  In Montgomery County, SHIRE has played an instrumental role in implementing an innovative project in Montgomery County, Maryland that has helped synergize community resources.  Through a public/private partnership, a Youth Health Builders Corps (YHC) has been formed, whose members, ages 12 to 18, are being trained as diabetes educators and advocates.  The youth have been recruited from two faith institutions in the county, and have already launched activities, including a website they have designed, which are intended to inform other youth, congregants and community members about diabetes – the nature of the disease, risk factors, as well as effective prevention, management and control strategies.  This project will serve as the springboard for the proposed initiative.

<DESC>Description.
NAICS code 541199.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 “Simplified Acquisition Procedures” (48 CFR Part 13), the United States Department of Commerce is providing widespread notice of this acquisition opportunity and is requesting proposals to provide technical assistance to the Government of Egypt (GOE) to supplement training provided to Egyptian diplomats at the Institute of Diplomatic Studies (IDS) in Cairo, Egypt. The successful contractor will work with United States Department of Commerce Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), IDS and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to improve the written and oral communications skills of newly-appointed diplomatic and commercial attaches.  

CLDP seeks to train IDS attaches in business writing and public speaking practices and techniques used by officials in the U.S. and throughout the world.  This training will assist Egyptian officials to better participate in global trade negotiations as opposed to conducting such negotiations outside the political process.  
 
This contract is for up to fifteen (15) days of work.  The successful contractor will be required to work with U.S. Government and GOE officials for two weeks in Cairo, Egypt. It is anticipated that work in the Country will commence on or about September 20, 2003. 

Evaluation Criteria. The contractor should have the following technical capabilities: 

1. Significant experience (at least 10 years) instructing courses on practical techniques to producing clear, well-organized professional correspondence, including letters, e-mails, reports, and memoranda;

2. Significant experience (at least 10 years) instructing courses on how to deliver effective oral presentations before small and large groups comprised of both government and private sector individuals; 

3. Experience interacting with the media, including television, radio and print;

4. Ability to teach using simulations and debate among the audience; and

5. Experience working internationally or with multinational audiences.  

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors are requested to submit a brief capability statement (not to exceed five (5) pages) which comprehensively addresses each criterion set forth above. Cost and technical proposals are not required and will not be considered at this time. The Government will review and evaluate timely received capability statements and those offerors who meet the Respondents Criteria will be deemed “qualified”. The Government will then furnish each qualified offeror with a draft copy of the Statement of Work, source selection criteria and proposal instructions. The Government may enter into discussions with qualified offeror after receipt of capability statements and after receipt of proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that such discussions are necessary, the Government will notify qualified offeror of the date/time for such discussions. For the sake of clarity, the Government may communicate with qualified offeror at any point during evaluation of the capability statements and proposal evaluation process. The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions at the Contracting Officer’s discretion.   

Contract Type and Period of Performance. The Government anticipates issuing a Purchase Order for a firm-fixed price that will require the contractor to complete the required work within 30 days of Purchase Order award. 

Additional Information. Compliance with protocol between the governments of the Country and the United States of America in connection with performance of the Contract will be required.  Qualified offerors will be briefed on the protocols and security requirements. The protocols and security requirements are not available for public dissemination.  Qualified offerors who have been provided with the protocol and security information will be forbidden from disclosing the terms, content and procedures of the protocol and security. Furthermore, while in the County, the selected contractor will be representing the Commercial Law Development Program, the U.S. Department of Commerce and, by extension, the United States Government. The contractor will therefore be required to adhere to all applicable ethics codes in effect in their respective jurisdictions and professions and contractors also must adhere to applicable federal conflict of interest statutes and standards of conduct.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors must submit two (2) copies of capability statements on or before 08/18/03.  The capability statements must specifically and comprehensively address the Evaluation Criteria and be submitted in writing. The address to which Capability Statements must be addressed and sent is: Cherita Toulson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6521, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230.  Electronic (e-mail) versions of the Capability Statements must be in Microsoft Word format and sent to Ctoulson@doc.gov.   All Capability Statements must be sent to assure receipt by the Government on or before 3:00 p.m. EST, August 18, 2003.

In-depth knowledge of WTO accession process; prior successful experience working with developing countries on WTO-related technical assistance projects; oral and written fluency in English and French including technical terminology in commerce, law, economic, and government policy; ability to travel outside of the United States of America; computer resources and skills that enable efficient transmission of large volumes of data domestically and internationally. 

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors are requested to submit a brief capability statement (not to exceed five (5) pages) which comprehensively addresses each criterion set forth above. Cost and technical proposals are not required and will not be considered at this time. The Government will review and evaluate timely received capability statements and those offerors who meet the Evaluation Criteria will be deemed “qualified”. The Government will then furnish each qualified offeror with a draft copy of the Statement of Work, source selection criteria and proposal instructions. The Government may enter into discussions with qualified offeror after receipt of capability statements and after receipt of proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that such discussions are necessary, the Government will notify qualified offeror of the date/time for such discussions.

The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions at the Contracting Officer’s discretion.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Core elements of the project:  1)Establish a consortium of laboratories that will develop and evaluate the capability of protein detection and measurement technologies to identify proteins relevant to cancer.  The project should be conducted by a minimum of three laboratories that will collaborate to utilize the same biological specimens for protein detection and analysis.
2)Apply technology approaches to protein identification and quantitation that include separation techniques and protein detection and identification methods including high throughput mass spectrometry (SELDI-or MALDI-TOF,LC/MS,LC/tandem MS, and affinity methods such as protein chip array, peptide aptamers, and isotope-coded affinity tagging.  (This project does not include development of technologies applied to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis).  3)Facilitate technology engineering that will improve the detection and identification of proteins, digested protein fragments, and peptides in serum.  4)To provide standardized measurements enabling characterization of serum soluble proteins, the laboratories will utilize a minimum of 12 in-bred mouse strain models representing different, well-characterized cancer tumors for serum protein measurement.  
5)The research project will include assessment of protein profiles (molecular signatures) from samples using two approaches: random protein identification in mouse serum and, a targeted (candidate)approach that utilizes labeled known peptides to identify specific protein moieties identified in the MS approach.  6)The laboratories will develop common resources for sharing among members of the consortium including: specimens (serum and plasma), reagents (monoclonal, polyclonal, and single chain antibodies), and data obtained from the protein measurements.  7)The consortium will establish a data and resource-coordinating center that will facilitate communication and resource exchange for the project.

Conditions:  1)The period of performance will be two years.  The NCI-Frederick (SAIC) anticipates making awards to 1 or more consortiums (each consisting of at least 3 individual laboratories).  2)It is assumed that significant technology will be brought to and developed from research and development conducted on the project.  Data developed from the project will be placed in the public domain (publications or database).

Specific Tasks:  1)Develop plan for use of a minimum of 12 individual in-bred mouse strains for acquisition of serum and plasma.  2)Develop reagents for antibodies, proteins and peptide arrays.  3)Develop database(s) and informatics support for archiving and analysis of proteomic data.  4)Develop standard assay materials, i.e., plasma, and serum, from mouse models.  
5)Sponsor workshops around the design, evaluation, and analysis of technology development and project design and progress assessment.  6)Develop milestones and deliverables of interest to broad research community.

<DESC>MODIFICATION: THIS RFQ IS BEING MODIFIED TO WITHDRAW THE REQUIREMENT FOR 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  THIS RFQ IS BEING SOLICITATED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS.  THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO AUGUST 8, 2003 AT 2:00 P.M. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-3-0037 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, MWA, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, (NCAUR), Peoria, IL, has a requirement/need  for a TLC-FID Analyzer "Brand Name or Equal" to Iatron Laboratories' Iatroscan New MK-6 TLC-FID Analyzer.  Listed are the description of  items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - TLC-FID Analyzer (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 -  Chromatography software with A/D serial port connection to Windows computer and connection box with cables for linking to TLC-FID Analyzer (1 unit); CLIN No. 3 - Chromatography Station Interface Box (1 unit); CLIN No. 4 - Cable Set (1 set); CLIN No. 5 - Chromrod Type SIII (5u Silica) (1 pack of 10); CLIN No. 6 - Ignitor for lighting FID burner (1 unit); CLIN No. 7 - Standard Chromrod Development Tank (1 unit); CLIN No. 8 - Tweezers for Chromrods (1 unit); CLIN No. 9 - Chromrod holder for MK-6 (1 set of two); CLIN No. 10 - MK-6 (1 unit);  CLIN No. 11 - Spare fuse (1 unit); CLIN No. 12 - Air pump unit (1 unit); CLIN No. 13 - Allen wrench set (1 unit); CLIN No. 14 - Hydrogen connecting pipe (1 unit); CLIN No. 15 - Operational manual (1 unit); CLIN No. 16 - Spotting guide for MK-6 Chromrod holders (1 unit); CLIN No. 17 - Spotting syringe equivalent to Dynatech 1.5 Microliter blunt tip (1 unit); CLIN No. 18 - Spotting syringe equivalent to Dynatech 5.0 Microliter blunt tip (1 unit); and CLIN No. 19 - One year parts and labor warranty.  The analyzer system will be used in the research of vegetable oils which cannot now be used in industrial fluids due to their poor low temperature and oxidation properties.  Scientists are attempting to develop processes to reduce double bonds present in triglyceride molecules by addition of some groups at double bond positions.  To do that, we need to observe and quantify changes in vegetable oils before and after this chemical reaction with considerable speed and accuracy.  This tool will also find application for separation and quantization in the field of lipids, food, and polymer additives.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the Analyzer must meet or include these minimum requirements:  (1) Must incorporate the separation efficiency of Thin Layer Chromatography combined with quick qualitative and quantitative analysis of separated compounds by Flame Ionization Detector to avoid troublesome coloring procedures required for conventional TLC after development.  (2) Must be upgradable for simultaneous analysis by Flame Photometric Detector for phosphorus and sulfur compounds identification.  (3) The instrument must be PC-compatible, so as to acquire chromatograms easily.  (4) Must have good quantification power and good reproducibility.  (5) Must be designed for simultaneous development and detection of components on 10 TLC rods (equivalent to Chromrods of Iatron Laboratories) mounted on one rod holder.  (6) Must have measuring time for one sample < 60 seconds.  (7) Must have TLC rods (equivalent to Chromrods of Iatron Laboratories) which can be used repeatedly.  (8) Must be scientifically proven that the instrument has been successfully used for triglyceride analysis.  (9) System must include all components necessary to perform analysis.  (10) Must include installation and provide training on operation during instrument installation.  DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE:  Offerors shall submit 2 copies of the Descriptive Literature describing their proposed equipment in enough detail to ascertain whether the equipment meets the criteria listed above.  REJECTION OF QUOTATION:  Failure to demonstrate compliance will be cause to reject the quotation without further discussions.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations.

(2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation.

<DESC>The NOAA, Office of Southeast Fisheries & Science Center intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with New Wave Research for Micro mill (0002-2900A), is an instrument comprised of a high-resolution microscope with motion control, a high speed precision drill, and computer system, and applicable software.  The Micromill product by New Wave Research is made specifically for drilling crystalline structures such as bone or in our case otolith (earstones) of fish.  The features of this instrument, particularly the stereo microscope xyz motion control, provides us with microscopic precision drilling and real-time ability to collect serial samples.  The computer and necessary software of the product furnishes us with a visual image of our sample with precise measurements, a property that reduces systemic errors.  Relative to our research, the microscope and drill combination of the Micromill will allow us to precisely extract the juvenile portion of the adult otolith for analysis as will as take "transects" of multiple samples from a single otolith.

<DESC>APPLICATION SUPPORT CENTERS (ASC) - WORLDWIDE:  The following is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only.  DHS has a worldwide requirement for: fingerprinting and other biometrics collection; ASC scheduling center/local scheduling support; outreach mobile route operations; facilities leasing/maintenance; application collection; special projects; forms and information distribution; citizenship testing services; project/administrative support; and other services to individuals seeking immigration benefits and/or entry into the U.S.A.  

Biometrics capture and other services for approximately 2.9 million immigration applicants annually is currently performed by almost 1,100 contractor staff at: approximately 135 government- or contractor-leased ASCs throughout the USA and its territories; over 45 domestic mobile routes; three overseas ASC test sites in Russia, Austria, and Kenya; and approximately 17 overseas mobile routes.  Sites may be added, moved, or deleted worldwide, and may include up to 150 overseas mobile routes with some travel to very primitive locations. Overseas sites/routes may be required in Europe, Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and Pacific locations.  DHS anticipates significant ASC organizational and process changes to meet future workload and homeland security issues.  Changes may include expanding biometrics capture to all immigration-benefits applicants (approximately 7 million annually), and/or to significantly expand or relocate biometrics collection overseas.  

The prime vendor must assume all leases for contractor-leased space (currently 83 leases), and may be required to obtain leases for a new domestic scheduling center, and potentially all overseas sites.  All contractor staff must be U.S. citizens, and must be able to obtain a T-2 clearance.  Labor categories will vary by site and may consist of site supervisors, quality assurance specialists, biometrics technicians, application technicians, linguists, armed and unarmed guards, schedulers, and other labor categories that cover the work listed above.

The DHS intends to acquire these services by awarding a competitive multiple-year BPA to up to two prime contractors with current General Services Administration (GSA) contracts.  All prime-contractors  MUST be Schedule 84 contract holders. Team members must be GSA Schedule contract holders. Subcontractors (non-team members) will not need to be Schedule holders.  DHS intends to limit Prime Offeror Teams to combined business concerns/organizations over 2,500 employees due to the staffing and management requirements of this large-magnitude project.    DHS will provide electronic solicitation copies only.  DHS anticipates receipt of proposals by January 2004, BPA award(s) by July 2004, and full contractual performance to begin November 2004.

	All interested business concerns shall provide the company name, mailing address, point of contact, email address, GSA Schedule 84 contract information, and information indicating the vendor's capability to provide these services in ten (10) or less pages, to the contracting officer listed below.  Text shall be at least single spaced, on a 8 ½ x 11 inch paper, with a minimum one inch margin all around.  Pages shall be numbered consecutively.  Pages submitted in excess of the page limitations stated throughout this document will not be evaluated.
	
Font Size - Print shall be of a minimum 12-point font size or a maximum 10 characters per inch (10-pitch, pica) spacing.  If not currently on GSA Schedule 84, your response MUST include replies to the following questions:  (1) Is your company willing to take the steps necessary to get on GSA Schedule 84?  (2) Please provide your anticipated timeframe and plan to get on GSA Schedule 84.  All prime contractors considered eligible for this award must be on GSA Schedule 84 by December 31, 2003.

The Department of Homeland Security  encourages the establishment of Contract Teaming Arrangements in accordance with - and as prescribed by - FAR Subpart 9.6.  

Use of information received from industry to complete final planning documents will be at the discretion of the government.  The government will not pay for the information solicited.  Proprietary information shall not be sent.  Questions may be submitted via email to the contracting officer only on August 18, 2003.  Submit responses no later than September 2, 2003 via email.  Attachments must be MS Office 97 compatible.  Reply to Jeanette Housen, email address jeanette.housen@dhs.gov, telephone number (202) 305-3113.  An electronic response is the only accepted method.

<SUBJECT>A -- IMMUNE BUILDING DEMONSTRATION: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-IBDEMO-SS
<CONTACT>Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email mblackstone@darpa.mil
<DESC>With this announcement, DARPA is providing advance notice of a potential Research and Development (R&D) program for the design, build, installation, and demonstration of an operational "Immune Building." This effort will represent the last phase of DARPA’s Immune Building program. The Immune Building Demonstration (IB Demonstration) will use a combination of active and passive countermeasures to validate, in a controlled test environment, the ability to protect inhabitants of buildings from covert or overt releases of aerosolized chemical or biological warfare agents. The availability of funds for this phase of the program is subject to Congressional approval; no proposals will be solicited until such time as funding is appropriated.  The actions outlined in this Notice are intended solely to enable potential sources to gain an understanding of the IB Demonstration R&D program and an opportunity to submit information which will permit evaluation of their capabilities, thereby allowing for a rapid transition when/if Congressional approval is provided.  It is DARPA's intention to release a "Draft" Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about 22 August 2003 for the Demonstration phase of the Immune Building program.  The RFP (Draft and Formal) will be unclassified; however, some of the design details will be contained in a "SECRET" appendix. To help foster the broadest possible competition, DARPA will sponsor two informational meetings, both in the Washington, DC, area.  The first meeting is a "Program Brief" and will take place approximately one week before the Draft RFP is to be released.  The Program Brief will have the format of a tutorial, describing the lessons learned to date in the Immune Building program, and providing the rational for the system-design specifications and guidelines that will be identified in the Draft/Formal RFP.  Attendance at this meeting is voluntary and will be limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that might contribute to the success of the IB Demonstration.   Such an expectation is likely to be met by organizations with experience in the fields of architecture and engineering (A&E); heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); chemical and/or biological warfare defense; filtration, neutralization, and decontamination; contamination transport modeling; chemical and/or biological sensors; building control systems; and/or the integration of complex systems.  Other areas of expertise may also qualify; in all cases qualification will be determined by DARPA.  Prior participation in the Immune Building program is not a prerequisite.  The individuals who wish to attend the Program Brief must have current US clearances at the SECRET level. Organizations and individuals interested in attending the Program Brief are required to register by 11 August 2003 following the instructions provided at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/ibdemo. Following the Program Brief, the IB Demonstration Draft RFP will be released to those sources deemed qualified by DARPA.  These individuals/organizations are encouraged to review the Draft RFP and provide written feedback to DARPA prior to the second meeting.  The second meeting is a "Bidders Brief" that will follow the Program Brief by approximately 3 weeks, allowing potential offerors time to digest the material from the tutorial and to identify aspects for which they would like additional clarification.  Attendance at this meeting is also voluntary and limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that might contribute to the success of the IB Demonstration.  However, attendance is not required in order to be deemed eligible to propose on this program.  The Bidders Brief will be divided into two parts.  The first part will cover only unclassified material and will be open to all registered/qualified offerors.  The second part will include classified (SECRET) information, so attendance will require a current US clearance. Instructions for registration will be provided at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/ibdemo following release of the Draft RFP.  This website will be updated to announce any changes in dates for the Information Briefings and/or Draft RFP release. Subject to Congressional approval/funding, a Formal RFP will be released to those sources deemed technically qualified to perform the IB Demonstration.  DARPA intends to award a single contract to a prime contractor (system integrator) to carry out the Immune Building Demonstration. This work will require substantial collaboration with DARPA, the operators and occupants of the operational building, members of the tri-service civil engineering community, and other Government personnel responsible for the installation, operation, training, and maintenance of these types of protective architectures.  The anticipated scope of work to be covered under the IB Demonstration includes:  a preliminary design of the protection (countermeasure) system for the building to be protected meeting the guidelines identified in the RFP; a (mathematical) model that predicts the contaminant fate and transport around the building, as well as the effects of the elements of and the usage (CONOPS) of the protective architecture; a trade study that uses the predictive model to refine the preliminary design; a full-scale physical model (testbed) that is configured to represent the floor plan and flow pathways within the building of interest (operational building), as well as the planned protective architecture for that building; a testbed-based proof of the effectiveness of the protective architecture; a finalized design, including fine-tuning in the hardware, software, and CONOPS as a result of the testbed measurements; installation of the finalized protective architecture into the operational building; and the test and evaluation of the effectiveness of the protective architecture in the operational building. The IB Demonstration is research and development that represents the last phase of DARPA's Immune Building program, which has been conducted over the past 3 years.  Research reports containing findings to date will not be made available for public release.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with either of the briefings discussed in this announcement.   All questions regarding this announcement and/or the Immune Building Demonstration Program, in general, are to be sent from the IM Demo website.  The Point of Contact for this announcement is Michael D. Blackstone, Contracting Officer, DARPA/CMO, email: mblackstone@darpa.mil. This announcement does not impose any obligation on the Government or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.

<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN, Charleston is soliciting information from potential sources for Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement (CALEA) Services for the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Electronics Surveillance Technology Section. The purpose of this notice is to (1) obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the area of support of the FBI's program for the implementation of the CALEA; (2) roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level; and (3) obtain the expressions of interest from all businesses in further discussions.   The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice DO NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or team's ability to perform. That evaluation will be part of a formal source selection process.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to how many and/or what types of set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small Businesses should note that the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330, and the size standard is $4 million.   The U.S. Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston (SSC) requires engineering support services.  The Government's intent is that any resultant contract will be comprised of one base year and four one-year options.  It will be awarded to a single firm/team using an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Cost-Plus-Fixed fee contract type.  The services acquired through the resultant CPFF contract will be used in SCC's support of the FBI's program for the implementation of the CALEA as listed in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The successful offeror will be required to have a minimum of 3 years CALEA experience in various labor categories to be considered for this contract.   The best-value award will consider technical issues significantly more important than cost, and subscribe to a Performance-Based Service. Contracting method of acquisition is essential for the Government to minimize unproductive performance on the part of the successful offeror. Therefore, the successful offeror will possess and propose to commit personnel on a full-time basis.  Additionally, it is the Government's position that the successful offeror possess, individually or as a team, the following:  (1) Experience in maintaining up-to-date knowledge and awareness of related policy and technical regulatory issues; (2) Experience in performing organization-wide surveillance activities over the issues facing and being addressed by organizations, including organic and contracted-support personnel; (3) Experience in performing technical solutions; and (4) Experience in establishing direct liaison with appropriate major law enforcement organizations.

<DESC>58 - The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is interested in receiving information from sources that feel they may be capable of providing off the shelf or near off the shelf capabilities that will support the MANPACK Technologies for the 21st Century, Advanced Concepts Technology Demonstration (ACTD) effort.  The information sought through this announcement will support USSOCOM and Marine Corps efforts to develop and package a toolbox of advanced capabilities, including an open, plug and play architecture that is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight and low power.   Today, most systems are developed independently and do not use open, plug and play architectures.  As a result, a total redesign is required when system upgrades are necessary.  Air, maritime, and larger land–based systems have had advanced threat warning capabilities for many years but these systems are too large for use by individual soldiers. Technology is available today that will allow development and packaging of advanced threat warning capabilities using an open, plug and play architecture, which is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight, and require relatively little power. MANPACK capabilities must operate in diverse environments and deal with a multitude of potential threat information quickly and easily without burdening the operator.  These capabilities, since transmitting RF is not always practical, must also meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  

Some of the “toolbox” technologies sought: 
Advanced signal detection; 
Sound detection and direction;
Sound canceling;
Biological/Chemical detectors; 
Body worn computers; 
Information display technologies including hand-held, wrist and head mounted displays;
Technologies for receipt, processing, control, and display of information from other platforms such as UAVs; 
Scaleable hardware (HW) bus structures (e.g. PCMCIA) that could be used in portable applications;
Language translation and exploitation;
Detection of enemy personnel, tanks, etc. via thermal, radar, etc.
Small belt worn quick scan energy detector (2MHz-10GHz objective);
Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) incorporated into the Manpack for demonstration of National Threat Warning capability;
Programmable electronic attack and/or jamming of specific targets;
Battlefield mapping and/or awareness.
Data input and output devices (preference to permit mostly hands free operation). 

Expertise and Advice Sought:
SIGINT HW & SW architecture;
National/Tactical Integration

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses;
Technologies that provide a mobile soldier threat warning to dangers in soldiers area;
Mature technologies:
ready for purchase within 12 months or 
requiring minimal assistance to be ready in 12 months.
Technologies on commercial formats, (e.g. PC104, C-PCI, PCMCIA, etc) or can be easily integrated into a manpack system.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Purchase.  This is a Sources Sought and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms, nor is the Government responsible to pay for samples or information received.  Innovative and/or revolutionary technical solutions are welcome.  Industry responses to this notice must contain the following information: (1) name and address, to include fax, email of firm and POC; (2) technical capabilities description.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention Marc A. Duval at duvalm@socom.mil or by phone at (813)281-0560 ext 304. Responses (eg white papers, limited to 30 pages) should be sent electronically to the United States Special Operations Command, ATTN: Manpack_ACTD@socom.mil (10MB limit).  Please cc Mr. Marc Duval via email on all related documents submitted (eg. White papers) at duvalm@socom.mil.  A cutoff date of COB 1 September, 2003 is established for the submission of responses.

<SUBJECT>B -- Trade Studies and Tactics Development for CV-22
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement intends to extend existing contract USZA22-98-D-0001 with the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office for CY04, CY05, CY06, and CY07.  The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps.  Bell Helicopter and Boeing Space and Missile Defense Systems, Helicopter Division were competitively selected to jointly develop and produce the V-22 and its variants.  The Department of the Navy is funding the R&D costs for the CV-22 up to an agreed to ceiling.  USSOCOM is funding the remaining capabilities needed to meet the Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for SOF requirements.  The CV-22 program often involves making a choice between competing functional systems being developed for other aircraft platforms.  The selected system must then be integrated into the CV-22 design, tested, incorporated in production planning/retrofit, and supported by the CV-22 logistical concept.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that Bell-Boeing  is the only source capable of evaluating candidate solutions against the evolving CV-22 development baseline as it progresses from Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review (CDR) and production decision in FY 05. In order to ensure that needed CV-22 performance capabilities are available to meet SOF operator requirements, detailed trade studies and analysis must be accomplished well in advance of the production program.  Therefore, it is imperative that USSOCOM have the capability of contracting with Bell-Boeing, the sole developer of the CV-22 system, to conduct trade studies and analysis of baseline /advanced CV-22 systems/sub-systems. This  contract will also continue a tactical simulation effort begun in FY97 and enhance its operational realism and functionality.  The tactical simulation support allows AFSOC aircrews to develop tactics to employ the CV-22 aircraft on SOF missions.  The hybrid characteristics of the CV-22 (hover like a helicopter/fly like a fixed wing airplane) provide the user with new capabilities and approaches to execute mission scenarios.  The SOF mission differs greatly from the USMC generic ship-to-shore mission.  The long range, clandestine, infiltration/exfiltration mission accomplished in adverse weather under a single period of darkness requires specific tactics to ensure aircraft survivability and mission success.  These tactics need to be developed and validated so crews can be trained and mission capable when CV-22 operational aircraft are delivered.  Based on current force structure planning, there will not be an overlap between current aircraft platforms and CV-22.  When these aircraft are delivered, they will be deployed operationally with a high projected operations tempo. The contractor has already   developed a simulator that replicates CV-22 functionality planned for the aircraft.  The simulator will be upgraded by the contractor to incorporate a new visual system to improve its fidelity.  The simulator will include  an operationally realistic environment that will allow aircrews to adequately assess the functionality of the CV-22 design.  A full fidelity simulation exercise to check out high-risk items was completed in Sep 97 as part of the CV-22 Crew Systems development and the program successfully completed the Crew Systems CDR in Oct 97.  A preplanned product improvement (P3I) program which will integrate USSOCOM special operations forces (SOF) unique capabilities in the CV-22 (a SOF variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps).  No solicitation will be issued.  The basic requirement was synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily on November 25, 1997, and updated on December 23, 1997.  The P3I Program was synopsized on February 1, 1999 and FY/CY03 was synopsized in the FedBizOps on March 28, 2003.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Jacqueline (Jackie) Germain, foreidj@socom.mil, fax (813)828-7504.   See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>99--Hogentogler & Co., Inc. - CPT parts, and repair and calibration service.
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Concerns having the ability to furnish the following supplies, and services are requested to give written notification, including, a telephone number for a POC to the acquisition office listed in this notice within 5 calendar days from the date of synopsis.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a recurring requirement for the purchase of various components, replacement parts, and equipment needed to perform Cone Penetration Testing (CPT). Reclamation also requires inspection, repair and calibration services for the CPT.   Reclamation has operated the Hogentogler & Co., Inc. CPT testing system since 1982.  The CPT is a test where a cone shaped penetrometer is pushed through the subsurface while various electrical instruments (force, pressure, etc.) are measured, recorded, and displayed for engineering, and geotechnical engineering analysis.  The test parameters are tip pressure, sleeve friction, pore pressure, inclination, temperature, and resistivity.  Testing is performed in accordance with ASTM D 5778.  Reclamation has been through several versions of Hogentogler's equipment and data acquisition equipment.  Today Reclamation runs the analog CPT on the EFCSIII computer system.  Both the field computer system and signal conditioning electronics in the cone penetrometer body are designed and fabricated by Hogentogler. Therefore, it is the Bureau's belief that Hogentogler and Co., Inc. is the only source capable in providing their proprietary CPT equipment parts, and repair and calibration services based on the facts above.  This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall provide detailed data concerning their capabilities and may request to receive a copy of the solicitation when, and if it becomes available.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.  See Note 22.

<DESC>DRAFT

Overview
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Operations Systems Center (OSC) has determined that tracking ship positions worldwide via automatic position reports (APRs) for the purpose of supporting search and rescue (SAR) is viable and cost effective. This method of vessel tracking and identification provides the current date/time, position, speed and heading from suitably equipped vessel(s), including those that carry Inmarsat C/GPS equipment.  It is initiated automatically and is error free due to the reduced need for human intervention.  Other types of shipboard equipment may be capable of generating acceptable APRs as well.  Data received at the OSC will be entered into the Automated Mutual Assistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER) system.  AMVER is a ship reporting system used since 1958 to support recognized SAR authorities worldwide by identifying ships in the vicinity of a distress situation at sea that might be able to assist.

Take note of the following stipulations:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;

Take note of the following stipulations:

PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER—CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (MAY 1999)
 
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
 
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.
 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
 
(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database.
 
(f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
 
(i) Making a correct payment;
 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
 
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
 
(g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
 
(h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
 
(i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
 
(j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.
 
(End)

F.O.B. DESTINATION (Nov 1991)
(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this statement, means --
(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
(b) The Contractor shall --
(1)
(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. ***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-14.*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339111 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all responsible Contractors may submit a quote.***The National Institute of Standards and Technology requires one (1) Pulsed 1 KHz Ultra Fast Laser Amplifier System. Uses for the Ultra Fast Amplifier System include pumping an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) (OPA, not part of this solicitation) in order to produce tunable pulses that can be converted into the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region. NIST does nonlinear optical studies (sum frequency generation spectroscopy, SFG) at interfaces, where a typical experiment involves obtaining an SFG spectrum of a biological monolayer. The sample is illuminated simultaneously with a broadband femtosecond infrared pulse (IR wavelength range 3-10 microns) and the tunable UV pulse from the OPA that will be pumped by this Ultra Fast Amplifier. The apparatus for producing the broad bandwidth IR femtosecond pulses already exists at NIST. This type of nonlinear spectroscopy requires IR and UV pulses that are synchronous in time and overlapped in space, with outstanding spatial and spectral stability.***This system shall work simultaneously with the existing NIST Femtosecond Laser System. NIST currently uses a Tsunami sub-50 fsec oscillator, pumped at 4W by a Millenia 5W green laser. The Tsunami typically produces pulses with a wavelength of 805nm and a bandwidth of 45 nm. The Tsunami seeds an ODIN 8-pass ring Ti: Sapphire amplifier. The Tsunami produces typically 0.35W average power (80 MHz rep rate); 0.25 W must go to the ODIN, and so 0.10 W is available to seed a new Regenerative Amplifier (RA). The proposed RA must be capable of being seeded by these oscillator pulses.***The system should have the following overall characteristics: (1) System can amplify the seed pulses from the existing Ti:Sapphire oscillator to energies of 2 milliJoules per pulse; (2) These pulses shall have a duration of 100 fsec or less; (3) This system also shall be capable of producing pulses of picosecond duration; (4) The pulses shall be synchronized within a fraction of their pulse duration with an existing NIST femtosecond laser system that operates at 1 KHz.***All interested quoters shall provide a quote for a Pulsed 1 KHz Ultra Fast Laser Amplifier System. The Ultra Fast Laser Amplifier System shall consist of the following components and shall meet or exceed the specifications as defined under each line item:  LINE ITEM 0001: Regenerative Amplifier  (RA) meeting or exceeding the following specifications: (1) Shall be compatible with NIST’s existing Oscillator; (2) Operation at 1 KHz is required, ability to change the repetition rate in the range 0-10KHz is preferred; (3) When appropriately seeded (i.e., with a tunable oscillator), the RA shall be capable of producing output wavelengths in range 780-830 nm,  greater tunability is preferred; (4) Pointing stability of the RA shall be no worse than 60 microradians over the course of a day and from day to day,  better stability is preferred; (5) Pulse duration of RA shall be less than or equal to 100fs;  the ability to produce pulses of shorter duration is preferred; (6)  The time-Bandwidth Product (TBWP) shall be less than or equal to 1.8 times the transform limit. (For a Gaussian pulse, the transform limit TBWP is 0.44 Hz. sec or 14.7 psec.wavenumbers),  TBWP less than 1.8 times transform limit is preferred; (7) Pulse energy greater than or equal to 2 mJ at 1 KHz repetition rate,  higher energy is preferred; (8) Spatial profile shall be round, Gaussian profile; M-squared  less than 1.8, smaller M-squared is preferred; (9) Energy stability 2% or better,  better stability is preferred; (10) Output linearly polarized greater than 98%; prepulse/postpulse extinction ratio greater than or equal to 100, higher is preferred; (11) Operation without recurring user intervention is very important. After 10 minutes warm-up, the RA shall behave the same from hour to hour and from day to day, without need for realignment of seed, stretcher/compressor, RA cavity, or pump laser for the RA.  The system will be installed on a research grade optical table in a room with temperature stability of  2 degrees F. The system shall have stability under these conditions. Pointing stability of RA output shall be sufficient to pump an OPA with little or no adjustment from day to day. Measured with a CCD camera 3 meters from the RA, pulse centroid of the RA beam shall be constant within 10 percent of a beam diameter from day to day; (12) Timing jitter of the RA pulses with respect to the pulses from the existing femtosecond apparatus shall be small: less than 50 percent of the RA pulse duration, more highly synchronous timing is preferred;  (13) The RA shall also be capable of producing narrowband pulses of duration somewhere in the range 2-5 psec and, (14) Warranty: At a minimum, a one year warranty including on-site service shall be provided on all parts of the system, a longer warranty is preferred. Warranty shall cover all parts, labor and travel. Contractor shall guarantee service and repair of the system within 5 working days after notification by NIST of a product failure; faster response is preferred. LINE ITEM 0002: Green Pump laser for RA meeting or exceeding the following specifications:  (1) Operation at 1 KHz is required, ability to change the repetition rate in the range 0-10KHz is preferred; (2) Pump laser wavelength in the range 525-535 nm; (3) Pulses of duration between 100 nsec and 400 nsec suitable for pumping a Ti: Sapphire RA; (4) Pulse energy equal to or greater than 20 mJ/pulse at 1 KHz, more pulse energy is preferred; (5) Pulse energy stability 2 per cent or better, more stable is preferred; (6) Good spatial mode quality, round flat top or Gaussian profile; (7) Pointing stability no worse than 100 microradians, better stability is preferred.; (8) Pump laser shall require single phase electric power, less than or equal to 208 Volts, less than or equal to 30 amps per phase; operation on ordinary 120 volt, 20 amp electric power is preferred.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.  This announcement constitutes the only synopsis/solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written synopsis/solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis/solicitation F8021031640100 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition (FAC) 2001-14.  The NAICS CODE is 561599 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million. Proposal evaluation factors are: (1) technical (2) price, and (3) value added benefits.

Value added benefits might include benefits, which result in a cost savings. Evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors, ultimately allowing the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.
