<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the application  of a class of coatings which may be referred to as the Ultra-Efficient-Engine-Technology-Project's low-conductivity thermal barrier coating (UEET low k TC) onto 84 NASA/GRC supplied substrates. These coatings shall be applied using proprietary specifications. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the above coating applications from Howmet Research Corporation, Operhall Research Center, 1500 South Warner Street, Whitehall, Michigan 49461-1895. The Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Justification for utilizing only one source is that this work builds on two prior one-year contracts between NASA/GRC and Howmet which has demonstrated the ability to apply the UEET low K TBC to an advanced superalloy substrate using deposition equipment and proprietary processing procedures. The specifications to be used for this work are proprietary to Howmet and are not available to others. The Government intends to acquire the coatings as a commercial item(s) using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 11,2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The NASA/MSFC X-43C Booster & Launch Services Project, as part of the Next Generation Launch Technologies Program, requires a system to boost the X-43C hypersonic Demonstrator Vehicle (DV) to conditions that enable ramjet/scramjet engine ignition and demonstration.  The X-43C DV is a small, autonomous technology demonstration vehicle powered by an experimental air breathing, ramjet/scramjet engine.  Contractual requirements for the booster provider include development of a booster system, or modification of an existing booster system, to meet the X-43C Launch System Requirements.  Contractual requirements also include integration of the DV, which is developed under a separate contract, to the boost vehicle, and providing launch services.  The X-43C technology demonstration is a follow-on effort to the X-43A Project which developed and utilized the Pegasus-derived Hyper-X launch vehicle system. Booster system requirements include adequate performance margin to accelerate an approximately 8,200lb payload to Mach 5.8 at a dynamic pressure of 880lbs/sq. ft and an altitude of 90,000 ft.    The booster vehicle must be capable of controlled level flight after boost engine burn-out to ensure successful separation of the demonstrator vehicle from the booster.  The booster must fly a depressed trajectory to limit structural and aerothermal loads on the demonstrator vehicle.  The X-43C DV is heavier and longer than the X-43A research vehicle.  However, the X-43C trajectory requirements are nearly identical to those of the X-43A vehicle. NASA has studied the applicability of available launch systems and has determined that the Orbital Sciences Corp. (OSC), 21700 Atlantic Boulevard, Dulles, VA 20166 Pegasus-derived Hyper-X launch vehicle system with aerodynamic lifting wing and moveable control fins as the only booster design capable of achieving the X-43C project objectives.	The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 11, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A -- ADVANCED ANTENNA TECHNOLOGY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>F19628-03-R-0047
<RESPDATE>042503
<ARCHDATE>07252003
<CONTACT>Mr. Bill Donaldson, Contracting Officer, 781-271-6091
<DESC>Advanced Antenna Technology Request for Information This is a request for information (RFI) and not a solicitation. INTRODUCTION: The Government is requesting information from companies working on multiple beam antenna designs suitable for high data rate airborne satellite and Line of Sight communication applications.  The Government is interested in receiving information from antenna systems vendors as well as key component vendors whose technology is useful in the development of multiple beam antennas.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to be used in determining development requirements of an airborne wideband antenna. SCOPE: The AF is seeking a scaleable, low profile airborne wideband antenna solution suitable for high data rate airborne satellite and Line of Sight communication applications.  It is desirable that this wideband antenna system be capable of operating simultaneously in EHF and either commercial or military Ka and/or Ku frequency bands.  Key issues of interest include antenna producibility, scaleability, and cost. The AF user community has overwhelmingly stated the need for simultaneous high data rate connectivity to multiple satellites or LOS receivers. However, companies should understand that although operational needs exist, firm technical requirements for an advanced airborne wideband antenna have not been defined.  Technical requirements will evolve and will be influenced by the availability, maturity and cost of technology; "cost as an independent variable" and "cost of ownership" are significant drivers.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to development of an airborne wideband antenna system.  The Government seeks to understand the current state of the art in higher frequency array design for communications, as well as future planned development or needed developments and how they might apply to a scaleable airborne wideband antenna system. The Government seeks to solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia with EHF/ Ku/ Ka band expertise in one or more of the following areas: 1.	Multiple, simultaneous, independently steerable beam antennas for EHF, Ka and possibly Ku bands of operation.  The envisioned antenna system includes transmit and receive capability, with an emphasis on scaleable architectures. 2.	Enabling antenna technology and/ or fabrication (i.e., HDI, multilayered manufacturing processes, etc.) 3.	Thermal analysis and thermal management strategies of antenna structures 4.	Application of digital signal processing techniques to beam formation 5.	Antenna component technology, such as phase shifters, amplifiers, true time delay, etc. OBJECTIVE SYSTEM: Low profile (approximate 3 to 5 inch height) scalable (modular), multi-beam, multi-band antenna to achieve an EIRP of 55-60 dBw (EHF) and a G/T of 8-11 dB/K (EHF) within an approximate 3 to 4 sq. ft. footprint DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: To achieve the Objective System the Government requests that interested companies provide an information package.  The technical areas of interest/ concern are listed below.  Use it as a guideline to formulate your reply, addressing areas that are pertinent to your technology: 1.	Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/ partner/ team member. 2.	Description of qualification: Projects Products Applicable experience including development and integration of similar airborne qualified antennas 3.	Definition of existing architecture, architecture integration challenges, and related critical manufacturing processes. 4.	Definition of antenna size, number of simultaneous beams, and the associated impact on the architecture and manufacturing approach, element spacing and scan range, lattice, LNA noise figure, phase shifter # of bits and losses, power amplifier design, power added efficiency, and output power. 5.	Recommendations on how to make the design suitable for operation on Navy, as well as Air Force, platforms (shipboard and airborne) in order to increase the production volume. 6.	Identification of how the antenna can be adapted to a scaleable architecture.  (Discuss a minimum replaceable unit concept versus alternative approaches.  In addition, discuss whether the antenna architecture lends itself to component upgrades over time.) 7.	Identification of process and component cost drivers and methodologies for lowering costs. 8.	Identification of key technologies that are not mature or advancements that can be leveraged to improve the technology. 9.	Description of thermal management design/ strategy. 10.	Identification of multiple beam control technology and maturity, beam update rate, beam pointing accuracy, sidelobe control, and pattern coverage when the antenna system is located on the platform.  (Highlight performance concerns in these areas.) 11.	Description of antenna installation and impact on various airborne platforms. 12.	Discussion of the use of a digital interface, and the possible implementation of signal processing techniques for beam adaptation. 13.	Description of antenna axial ratio performance and scan losses as a function of scan angle. POINT OF CONTACT: Responses to this RFI are due to Mr. Bill Donaldson by 3:00 PM EST on 25 April 2003. If Classified Information is to be included in response to this request, please notify Mr. Donaldson at least three days prior to submission.  Respondents should identify their company's name, address, telephone number, point of contact, and whether they are a large or small business.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked.  Responses should include 4 paper copies and an electronic file.  The electronic file should be in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) or otherwise compatible with the Microsoft Office 2000 suite of software.  All copies should be delivered simultaneously to the following address: 		ESC/MCK 		MITRE Bldg "D" 		50 Griffiss Street 		Hanscom AFB, MA  01731-1620 		(Attn:  Mr. Bill Donaldson) INDUSTRY DAYS: Industry Days will be scheduled on 14 - 16 May 2003 at the MITRE facility, Bedford MA, to discuss Government needs and objectives.  Follow-up one-on-one sessions will be conducted that same week with those companies expressing interest.  These one-on-one sessions will be time limited to between two and four hours, depending on the number of interested companies.  Requests for a one-on-one session should be made no later than 3:00 PM EST on 30 April 2003 to:  Mr. Bill Donaldson, phone: 781-271-6091, email: bill.donaldson@hanscom.af.mil; or  Ms. Janice Sullivan, phone: 781-271-5485, email: janice.sullivan@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>ESC/FD will issue a Request for Proposals for the acquisition of fixed and relocatable IBDSS capabilities on or about 7 April 2003.  ESC/FD intends to award four (4) multiple task order contracts to support this acquisition, but reserves the right to award more contracts, fewer contracts, or none. ESC/FD intends to set aside two (2) of these contracts for small businesses. This effort will include the procurement, integration, installation, and support of IBDSS equipment at Government and non-Government sites throughout the world.  IBDSS integration deals with existing electronic security systems and introduction of new technologies to improve the full spectrum of security capabilities.  The scope of work includes site surveys, system effectiveness assessment, requirements definition, system engineering, project package development (including security system and site preparation designs, lists of materials, installation specifications, installation instructions), procurement of security equipment and ancillary materials, site preparation, security system installation and integration, testing, removal of previous security systems, site restoration, security consultation, contractor logistics support and technology insertion.  Site preparation includes installation of passive delay systems (e.g., security fencing), drainage and erosion control, grading, trenching, above and below ground power and signal cabling, pedestal installation, integration and site-specific software configuration.  Installation includes equipment installation, hardware and software integration and site-specific software configuration.  Technology insertion deals with applying expanding or new technologies into the IBDSS through software and hardware development and/or the application of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. Contractor logistics support provides for the repair and technical support of fielded IBDSS equipment and selected legacy systems.  The period of performance is expected to be 60 months.  Successful offerors will have the following capabilities:  a) prior experience in: upgrading security systems through technology insertion; and designing and integrating electronic security systems comprised of components with both open- and closed-architectures; b) substantial experience in the site specific requirements definition, design, site preparation, installation, integration and test of large scale electronic security systems for fixed, tactical and nuclear sites; c) ability to accomplish installation throughout the continental United States and overseas; d) capacity to support cyclical requirements ranging from one to as many as four large scale design and installation projects simultaneously; e) cost and schedule control system capable of tracking and reporting commitments and expenses on a time and materials, delivery order contract;  f) ability to obtain Government clearance to the SECRET level; g) and ability to manage sub-contracts and material sources. Interested potential offerors should monitor the Hanscom Electronic Request for proposal Bulletin Board (HERRB), http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil. The full Request for Proposal package will be posted there. Offerors desiring hard copies of the RFP or notification when posted should contact the buyer, Mr. Walter Ronten, as soon as possible.  The small business definition for this contract is 750 employees (North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 334290.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  Additional IBDSS information may be accessed by visiting ESC's Business Opportunities (HERBB) Web Page: http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/esc_opps.asp?rfp=R485. See Notes 2 and 26.

Specific dates to be determined by UNICOR. Contractor will be given a two-week lead time for notification. Since the tanks are to be cleaned on a separate occasions, two estimates are required. After all liquid and sludge is removed from the tank, UNICOR will introduce a descaling compound into the system, which will be allowed to react overnight. The descaler, which will be an all-liquid content, will then be removed and disposed of. There will be occasions that only the phosphate liquids and sludge will be disposed of and there may not be a factory need to have the tanks descaled.

Offerors shall contact Tee Cavanaugh at 202-305-7302 or email at tcavanaugh@central.unicor.gov for copies of MSDS.

<DESC>The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area is located on National Forest land on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest, along the Hope Highway & in recreation sites from Mile 0.5 to Mile 5.5 on the Kenai Peninsula.  The project consists of conducting mechanical tree & slash removal & site preparation for natural regeneration work on approximately 120 acres within a 217 acre project area to meet fuel reduction & natural regeneration objectives, construction of four, 50 – 195 foot long temporary road spurs off the Hope Highway to provide access to the project area, closure & site preparation for natural regeneration of the temporary road spurs at the conclusion tree removal operations.

National Forest land in the project area has significant amounts of spruce tree mortality, breakage & blowdown caused by the spruce bark beetle epidemic in southcentral Alaska, with many of the dead spruce trees already jackstrawed on the ground.  The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area is classifed as being located in a wildland urban interace for the purpose of hazardous fuel reduction because of it’s close proximity to residental structures in the community of Sunrise.  There are no private structures within the fuel reduction unit in this Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area. 

The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) & supplies to perform the following work in the Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest:

The contractor will be responsible under this contract to provide necessary equipment to develop four spur roads into fuel reduction unit 1.  Typical spur road access will include entry culvert, gravel fill approximately 18 feet wide for culvert installation, road fabric material over culvert fill with rock on top of fabric & spot rocking of temp roads & landings.  The Forest Service has applied for temporary road construction permits from the Department of Transportation for this purpose.

Culvert removal & mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of four temporary road spurs with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake and/or ripper at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

Tree Removal in Unit 1 totaling approximately120 acres.  The work in each tree removal unit consists of mechanically felling all live trees marked with yellow paint & all dead & down trees, whole tree yarding of all felled & down trees to landings. All trees will be yarded to landings.  At landings approximately 600,000 bf will be de-limbed, bucked to length & decked seperately to Forest Service specification.  All remaining slash will be decked by contractor for later burning by the Forest Service.

Mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of fuel reduction Unit 1 with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake or excavator mounted slashbuster at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

The contractor shall, without additional expense to the government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses & permits, complying with federal, state, or municipal code & regulations applicable to the performance of work.

Work must be started within 5 days of Notice to Proceed.  Work shall be performed during normal Forest Service business hours, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer/Purchasing Agent.  All work must be completed by close of business on September 30, 2003.

The government reserves the right to adjust work locations within the project area to meet project needs & the right to add additional acreage or units to the total project operation.  

All costs for equipment maintenance and repair, fuel & filters, mobilization & demobilization to & from the project area must be included in the bid price amount for each Bid Item.  Bid quantities (number of acres) for each fuel reduction unit are approximate estimates at the time of receiving bid quotations.  After completion of fuel reduction operations in each unit, the government will complete a field traverse to establish actual treatment acreage.   Contract payments will be based on unit acreage determinations & the acreage unit price identified by the contractor.  The government reserves the right to add additional acreage to the total project operation pending the availability of funds.

Within seven days following contract award, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the government, a performance bond.  The performance bond may be provided in the form of cash, to be held on security account by the government, or in the form of a deposit account by a financial institution acceptable to the government.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a two year contract, with three one-year options, to provide a source of Worker's Compensation Insurance as required by the Defense Base Act (DBA).  Under all USAID contracts involving any overseas performance, contractors are required by law to provide overseas employees with insurance coverage pursuant to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (commonly called the "Defense Base Act" or DBA) (42 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.).  DBA coverage applies to individuals employed under USAID contracts or subcontracts or subordinate contracts regardless of the duration of their assignment, and is over and above any State Worker's Compensation insurance coverage.  DBA insurance coverage is required for employees of contractors (and their subcontractors) unless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.  Waivers have been obtained for foreign nationals in over 80 countries.
The resulting contract will be a fixed-rate Requirements type contract.  All USAID contractors procuring DBA insurance (i.e., renewing coverage or obtaining new coverage) for a USAID financed contract or subcontract at any tier that requires overseas services, are required by USAID Acquisition Regulations and the terms of their contracts to purchase DBA insurance under this Requirements contract.  USAID intends to make one (1) award under the solicitation to the most responsible firm/organization whose proposal offers the best value to the Government.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 524126.  The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.

The Predator's critical physical and performance characteristics include the following: 1) weight less than 22 pounds, 2) length less than 40 inches, 3) Probability of Hit of 0.5 (threshold), 0.8 (objective) against stationary targets at ranges of 17 to 600 meters and against moving targets at ranges of 17 to 250 meters, 4) ability to defeat a T-80 Main Battle Tank equipped with next generation advanced armor protection, supplemental armor kits, and explosive reactive armor, 5) soft launch capability allowing it to be fired from a masonry room measuring 4.57 meters x 3.66 meters x 2.13 meters and possessing 2.04 meters2 of ventilation, 6) a mission reliability of 0.85 (threshold), 0.95 (objective), and 7) no maintenance required above the operator level.  The Predator will be built to the current Government performance specification.  The Full Rate Production contract will consist of a Base Year (FY04) and 4 Option Years (FY05-08) and will require the delivery of approximately 3,600 weapons and associated engineering support at an estimated cost of $185M over the life of the contract.  MARCORSYSCOM intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Electronics & Fire Control (LMM&FC), 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, Florida, 32819-8907.  LMM&FC is the designer/developer of the Predator Short Range Anti-tank Weapon (SRAW) and the existing producer of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Predator weapon systems.  Production of the required supplies by any source other than the existing Predator contractor requires a substantial initial investment and/or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Additionally, production by the existing LRIP contractor will avoid substantial duplication of cost to the government to re-establish and re-validate a Predator production capability with a new manufacturer.  As a result of the utilization of the Alpha Contracting on the Predator program, a formal RFP is not available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences intends to procure, on personal service basis, the operation of the Spaceline space life sciences bibliographic services unit, composed of approximately ten (10) persons with specialized expertise.  The unit shall provide scientific and technical expertise in the support and ongoing development of space life sciences bibliographic data, preparation of specialized bibliographies and literature searches, and creation of written summaries of space life sciences research.  The contract shall consist of a base period of one year, followed by four one-year option periods.  The Spaceline Project was established to create and continue development of online bibliographic data in the space life sciences.  It maintains a database as a cooperative venture between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the National Institutes of Health, and the Spaceline Project of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).  The Spaceline database consolidated results of space life sciences research into a single source and made this resource available to the scientific and educational communities.  Duties under this contract will include identifying new literature to be added to the database; obtaining copies of desired publications to be added; creating and adding new NASA records to the NLM databases and modifying NLM-derived records with necessary data; continuing to perform associated database developmental activities with NLM to keep space life sciences data current and optimize its accessibility; serving as the primary source of information and outreach about space life sciences bibliographic data; providing bibliographic and literature searching services to designated NASA personnel, including regular compilations of recent publications;  and selecting and creating approximately ten (10) written summaries per year describing highlights of NASA space life sciences research.  The contractor is expected to make a reasonable effort toward the collection of data and entry of records.  It is expected that approximately 1,000 new records and 500-1,000 older records will be entered on an annual basis, keeping the data current with the new literature and continuing to fill gaps in the older literature.  Although these ranges are flexible, the Government reserves the right to inspect the progress of the data collection and monitor the contractor’s performance in this area.  The contractor shall submit an Annual Report, of which one copy each shall be sent to the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  This contract will be for the personal services of the individuals designated in the contract in support of the Spaceline project.  The contractor will be required to provide the best-qualified individuals available.  All personnel hired for this project will be subject to the final approval of the COR and the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is expected to perform the requirements on an independent basis.  Although direct supervision will be rare, the COR or designated government personnel may provide periodic direction and oversight of the project.  Contractor personnel may work side by side with government personnel in certain areas of the project.  Requests for solicitation packages must be received no later than 4:00 pm EST, April 11, 2003.

<DESC>Evaluation of Chemopreventive Agents by In Vivo Screening Assays

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Chemoprevention Development Group (CADRG), is interested in evaluating inhibitors or potential inhibitors of any stage of carcinogenesis, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents against cancer. Such agents are to be further evaluated in appropriate toxicological or clinical settings. The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for evaluation of chemopreventive agents. This plan delineates detailed criteria for classifying the quantity and quality of information that currently exits on any chemopreventive agents and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer. The primary purpose of this RFP is to evaluate chemopreventive agents In Vivo for inhibition carcinogenesis. The object of these studies is to establish the relative efficacies of selected chemopreventive agents in at least one animal model system. The animal model systems represent various groups elected target organs, different species, and different carcinogens. Those interested in obtaining a copy of this RFP should send their e-mail address to Aglae Cantave at ac283g@nih.gov and a copy of the RFP will be forwarded electronically. AN AWARD WILL ONLY BE MADE TO A MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDER IN THE IN VIVO MASTER AGREEMENT POOL. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710. Questions should be directed via facsimile or e-mail to Aglae Cantave, Contract Specialist, Prevention, Control Population Sciences Section, Research Contracts Branch, National Cancer Institute Bethesda Maryland, 20892-7195.  Phone: (301) 496-6987; fax: (301) 402-8579; e-mail ac283g@nih.gov NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Numbered Note 26: Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>NA The National Park Service (NPS) is seeking one or more nursery or plant propagation organizations to propagate native plants for National Parks in Alaska, Arizona California, Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, South Dakota Texas, Washington and Wyoming.  The government may elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts for the services to be provided by two or more sources under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference of the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Offerors need not have experience in all states listed in order to be selected.  Specialists in particular ecosystems are encouraged to apply.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  The government will use such factors as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost-control, or other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  Interested firms are encouraged to team with subconsultants as needed to meet scope requirements. The selected firm(s) shall be able to perform the following tasks: prepare revegetation plans and provide technical assistance in the field of native plant revegetation and ecological restoration;  collect seed and cuttings; propagate native plants from NPS genetic stocks; locate and provide plants when strict genetic considerations are not applicable; hold and care for plants in the contractor nursery if project delays require; prepare planting sites; control exotics; salvage plants from designated areas; install seed and plants; construct or apply plant protective devices or substances; provide plant establishment care; and monitor revegetation/restoration success.  NPS genetic conservation policy: The National Park Service policy calls for the preservation of native plant communities and their genetic resources wherever possible in natural zones. Accordingly, road slopes and other large areas intended to support self-sustaining native plant communities will usually be restored with local genetic stocks of native species. Most propagation requested under this IDIQ will require use of seed or cuttings native to areas which the NPS will designate as appropriate for a particular project.   Genetic policy is less stringently applied for landscaping around developed areas. Depending on the site, the project time frame, and the importance of genetic issues there, large landscape plants may be custom-grown or they may be provided from sources other than park gene pools. Preferably provided plants will be site-adapted (i.e., from genetic stocks likely to survive at the project site). Materials to be produced or supplied: The types of materials to be produced include, but are not limited to: trees and shrubs in seedling, 1 gallon and 5 gallon sizes; and grasses and forbs in plugs, tubelings and other small containers.  For areas where a more mature landscape is desired and genetic integrity is not crucial, the contractor may be requested to provide the same sizes of materials from sources that are likely to survive well at the project site. The scope of work includes but is not limited to the following:  1.  Revegetation Consulting: Utilizing NPS regulations and policies, prepare revegetation plans or sections of plans for park projects or provide technical assistance to park staff.  Plans may include, but are not limited to, analyses of soil resources, recommendations for soil salvage, topsoil storage, and soil amendments; seeding and planting prescriptions; installation techniques;  plant protection, supplemental watering and establishment care;  work scheduling, and cost estimating. 2. Seed and Cutting Collection: Collect seed, cuttings and native soil for mycorrhizal inoculum from within designated national park areas. Provide all labor, materials, equipment, supplies, and transportation needed to collect seed and cuttings for plant propagation. 3. Plant Propagation: Provide a permanent greenhouse/nursery facility with heat, water, fertilizer, insecticides, fungicides, and photo periods as needed to ensure the propagation of healthy seedlings. Stock under production must not interbreed with other ecotypes of the same species and potting mix must not be contaminated with weed or species alien to the designated park. Provide appropriate measures of hardening and site adaptation to prepare stock for successful transplanting into the park. Records must be maintained throughout production and provided to the National Park Service. 4. Plant Provision: Provide native seed and plants in sizes ranging from seedlings to 2" caliper trees that are native to the designated park and adapted to the environmental conditions at the project site, but not necessarily from local genetic stocks. 5. Holding: Provide holding for plant materials which will ensure healthy stock if there are changes in the delivery date. Include repotting when necessary. 6. Site Preparation: Prepare soil as needed, including scarification and addition of appropriate soil amendments. Install erosion control measures as needed. 7. Exotics Control: As appropriate and acceptable in the designated park, utilize hand pulling, clearing, tilling and chemical application practices to control exotic species at the revegetation site before and after installation. 8. Plant salvage and direct transplant: Dig native plants mechanically or by hand from designated areas only. Plants will range in size from seedlings to 2-inch caliper or larger. Hold in storage areas. Provide care during storage. 9. Installation: Deliver and install seed and plant material. As directed, mulch and perform other associated planting practices. Provide a one-year guarantee for plants installed by the offeror. 10. Protection: Provide protection from human trampling, and surface and underground predators as needed. Methods may include protective netting, photo-degrading protector tubes and repellents, and temporary fencing. 11. Follow Up Care: Provide, upon request, care for revegetation installations until the plants are established (approximately 2-3 years) .Care to include exotics control, weeding and irrigation as needed. Provide written progress reports as needed. 12. Monitoring: Establish baseline conditions and monitor revegetation success following installation for a period of 1- 5 years, depending on the situation.  The National Park Service will award an indefinite quantity contract to one or more successful offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  Individual task orders will be placed to order services as they are required and the funding becomes available.  The total of all task orders per year will not exceed $1,000,000.  The maximum task order amount will not exceed $200,000.  The selected firm(s) is guaranteed a minimum amount of $25,000 throughout the life of the contract.  The term of the contract shall be one year with four additional one-year options.  This procurement is set aside for small business concerns. The Standard Industrial Code for this procurement is 113210.  To the fullest extent, the NPS welcomes the participation of women and minority-owned and operated firms.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 1443N2000033500 will be available on or about the 15th day after this announcement is published.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIMH-03-DM-0003 entitled "Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS)" under Full and Open Competition procedures using North American Industry Classification System 541720.  

NIMH seeks the support of a Contractor who will be responsible for the establishment of a network of Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS) that will utilize the scientific opportunity created by new insights into the neurobiology of attention, working memory, and other fundamental cognitive processes, to identify and test potential therapeutic agents targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.  These treatment units will engage in scientific activities to define experimental designs to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological strategies to enhance cognition in schizophrenia, identify and select promising compounds and conduct proof of concept and/or phase II clinical trials, and identify and develop opportunities for industry/academia/government collaboration in testing compounds of potential utility in alleviating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia; 


It is anticipated that the Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia (TURNS) will become national resources where studies of the safety and efficacy of novel compounds targeting cognition in schizophrenia can be conducted in a prompt and cost effective manner.  This will be accomplished by building on existing research resources at the host institutions and by combining the necessary expertise in clinical pharmacology, clinical trials and neuropsychology.  The TURNS will work as a network of research sites, identify promising potential procognitive therapeutic agents, and conduct high priority clinical studies focused on enhancing neurocognition in schizophrenia including (but not limited to) general safety profile, drug-drug interactions, efficacy (particularly early proof of concept), dose ranges, dose regimen, pharmacokinetics, and effect on other dimensions of symptomatic and behavioral disturbance in schizophrenia.  In addition, the TURNS will promote the validation of specific measures of cognition in schizophrenia for use as endpoints in clinical trials and refine methodological approaches for determining the efficacy of compounds for this indication. One of the TURNS ("a leader among peers") will function as a Coordinating Center (Contractor) for the entire project.  This lead TURNS shall assemble a team of senior researchers who provide intellectual leadership in Neuropharmacology of Cognition in Schizophrenia.  The lead TURNS shall also motivate and lead the contract related activities performed at each TURNS.

A thirty-nine (39) month base contract with one (1) option for an additional twenty-four (24) months is contemplated.  Plans are to award a contract by September 30, 2003.

RFP No. NIMH-03-DM-0003 is scheduled for electronic release on or about April 11, 2003 and the receipt date of proposals is scheduled on or about May 23, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through http://www.fedbizopps.gov or the NIMH home page by using the following instructions: access the home page at http://www.nimh.gov, first select Funding Opportunities, then Contracts, then NIMH Requests for Proposals.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet sites for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any. Please note that the RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, Reporting Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions.  All information required for the submission of an offeror will be contained in the electronic RFP package.  Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado requires air sampling equipment to build a global atmospheric observing system for the carbon cycle, with emphasis on North America.  The basis of the observing system consists of frequently and very accurately measured concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) near the surface, on very tall transmission towers, and on small airplanes.  (A) Requirement: NOAA intends to issue an RFP for automated air sampling systems.  The contractor will be required to perform the following two tasks:  1.   Manufacture and/or procure parts for, and build, 76 sets of sub-assemblies for automated air sampling systems (12 flask system). 2.  Assemble 72 sets of sub-assemblies into 72 fully functional automated air-sampling units.  (The remaining 4 sets of sub-assemblies will be used by CMDL for spare parts).  (B) Government Furnished Materials and Documents: The Government will provide potential contractors complete engineering drawings of the specialty parts and sub-assemblies, wiring diagrams, and specifications and layout for final assembly.  (If your company would like a copy of these documents before the RFP is released, send a letter to Susan Labovitz at the Department of Commerce, NOAA, MASC, 325 Broadway - MC#3, Boulder, CO  80303-3328.) The Government will also provide a hard-shell case and a controller board for each unit.  Certain parts, (motors and stopcocks) must be used for this procurement.  A list of these specific parts including the company name and part number will be provided in the RFP.   (C) Background:  The vertically integrated concentration difference of a chemically stable gas downwind and upwind of a major source area of a trace gas reflects the total source strength of that gas between the measurement points.  The atmospheric measurements need to be very accurate to meaningfully quantify the relatively small concentration differences.  Many of the greenhouse gases have a large and very nearly constant background concentration because they build up in the atmosphere over many years.  NOAA employs two methods, automated measurements with in-situ analyzers and discrete air samples.  The latter are analyzed in NOAA's laboratory in Boulder.  The demanding accuracy requirement sets severe limits on the measurement and sampling methods that can be employed.  In the case of discrete samples (which applies to this procurement) NOAA has tested over the years a number of materials and valves for the air sample containers, different metals and metal surface treatments, plastics, and glass.  The containers have to meet the specification that the concentration changes of the measured trace gases (carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen, sulfur hexafluoride, and various isotopic ratios) stay below prescribed limits during storage of up to four weeks.  Thus far, only glass containers with glass piston valves fitted with Teflon O-rings have met all of the requirements.  During the last ten years NOAA has developed an automated air sampling package consisting of a gas manifold, a controller, and 12 sampling flasks, packaged and shock-protected in a hard-shell suitcase.  The package has been flown on aircraft, and is also suitable for use on ships or on fixed platforms such as tall towers.  It can be shipped through standard channels such as the mail, UPS or Fedex.  The chemical analysis of the flasks in NOAA's laboratory is automated as well; the individual flasks are not removed from the package.  After connecting the package to the analytical system, the computer controlling the various measurement instruments communicates with the controller in the flask package with instructions to open and close specific flask valves so that the flasks are sequentially analyzed.  (D) Testing of Assembled  Units:  See Attachment 1.  (E) Period of Performance - The contract shall be complete within one year of execution.   See note 26.

<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for services to perform the work entitled, "Public Health Applications Technical Requirements Workshop".  The Statement of Work is as follows: 1.0 BACKGROUND NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center will host three technical requirements and information workshops in support of NASA’s Public Health Applications Program.  These workshops are designed to 1) understand and baseline partner agency disease surveillance technologies; 2) understand epidemiological information requirements and 3) map technology and information requirements to NASA technology capabilities and derivative information products.  NASA anticipates working in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) on these activities.  NASA anticipates these workshop findings will advance the integration of advanced geospatial information and remote sensing technology and data for use in public health surveillance.  The primary goal of these workshops is to exchange information pertaining to infectious disease informatics for measurable improvement to disease surveillance and decision support systems.  These workshops will focus primarily on NASA capabilities (technology and standard data products) to enhance the CDC Environmental Health Tracking Network (EHTN) and two initiatives under the Department of Defense Bio-Defense Initiative (BDI).   A third workshop is planned to validate NASA’s science investments in West Nile Virus predictive modeling and mapping.  The CDC, in conjunction with public health academia, will provide feedback and guidance to NASA’s Public Health Applications Program.  This information will be used by program management to determine what (if any) NASA contributions may be appropriate for the substantive enhancement of the CDC and local government public health responses to WNV. A significant gathering of invited scientists and government personnel with experience and interest in public health practice and/or the use of infectious disease informatics are expected to attend.  NASA’s Stennis Space Center is one of four primary program elements that comprise NASA’s Public Health Applications Program.  Stennis Space Center personnel have extensive experience in requirements definition, applications research, integration and performance benchmarking, and provide systems engineering expertise in support of the Public Health Applications Program.	2.0 SCOPE This effort will generally address all of the technical and administrative support required to assist NASA in hosting these workshops to meet meeting objectives.  This may include labor, materials, and travel.	3.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 3.1	   The contractor and NASA shall work jointly in the development and coordination of these workshops. 3.2	The contractor shall work with CDC, DoD and other government and/or academic personnel to provide logistical assistance for the access and use of conference facilities.   3.3  The contractor shall support the coordination of workgroup breakout sessions and information/requirements processing.  This task will include short summary reports of findings and softcopy archiving of presentation material for working group distribution. 3.4     The contractor shall support the use of novel GIS and remote sensing technologies and data products, particularly NASA standard data products, that are not commonly used in health research and application.  This may include development of predictive models, algorithms, and technical standards. 3.5      The contractor shall support pre-conference and on-site registration.  This task will include pre-conference distribution of on-line registration and logistic information, as  well as on-site support including collection of registration fees, providing information packets, name tags, attendee list, etc.   3.6  The contractor shall support the overall scheduling, coordination, and logistics throughout the duration of the conferences, as needed.  4.0 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE The conference(s) shall be held at the University of Mississippi Medical Center Complex in Jackson, Mississippi.  5.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The period of performance shall be one (1) year from the date of this contract.  The workshops are tentatively scheduled for the April 2003 through April 2004 timeframe.   6.0 TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT Timi S.

Background: The scope of work supports the Environmental Protection Agency's  (EPA) critical and high priority need to test a range of set up conditions and evaluate the performance of the numerical simulation of airflow and pollution dispersion around buildings produced using the Fluent CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Software.  The numerical simulations resulting from  Fluent CFD Software shall be compared with data from field measurement studies, wind tunnel model studies, and applications of routinely available simplified Air Pollution Dispersion Models.  This project  supports the development and performance assessment of Fluent CFD Software to determine how  it may best be applied by EPA to support the assessment of the potential effects on human health following the events at the New York World Trade Center.  The EPA will provide the contractor with specifications for the buildings and atmospheric boundary conditions required to set up each case  study.  The EPA will provide the contractor with a list of software parameters and a numerical range for each parameter that will be tested to assess their resultant effects.  The contractor shall meet with the project officer weekly to present and review results from the previous weeks work.  At  this meeting, the project officer shall provide new specifications for the next weeks work. The EPA has a Human Exposure Modeling Facility that contains several EPA maintained workstations including a the SGI workstation with licensed Fluent Software and networked to the EPA IBM SP multiprocessor  computer.

Access  to the EPA computers is not possible off site due to EPA security systems. The primary focuses of this  procurement requires the contractor to 1) receive and review written instructions defining specifications for Fluent CFD Software set up including the buildings and atmospheric boundary  conditions for each case study, the physical processes, list of software parameters and a numerical range for each parameter to be evaluated.  Analyses and preparation of reports on the results of this project may be completed off sight. 2)  The results of the Fluent CFD computer runs completed  under Task 1 shall be analyzed and compared with measurement data from EPA field measurement studies, EPA Wind Tunnel model studies, and simple Air Pollution Dispersion Models.  EPA will provide the contractor with all data to be used to support these comparisons.  EPA will provide the contractor  the software code and users guide for the AERMOD and other simple air pollution dispersion models which will be run to provide other model data for comparison.   The contractor shall prepare written descriptions that are sufficient in detail to report observed effects on the airflow and pollutant  dispersion due to differences in set up and boundary condition parameters.  The report shall include written documentation of all computer files (input, set up and output) prepared or produced.  The copy of files shall be maintained on a designated EPA computer storage system.  The contractor shall  prepare monthly progress reports on technical progress. Deliverables and Schedule:  1)  Weekly Technical Reports summarizing case studies set up and results including a brief description for the previous weeks work with documentation of prepared and produced computer files under Task 1.  2)   Monthly Progress Reports referencing and integrating the technical progress provided by the Weekly Technical Reports along with the analyses and comparisons with other data under Task 2.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service intends to purchase 1,086 Advanced Facer Canceler System InkJet Canceler (AFCS-IJC) Modification Kits.  The USPS has a fleet of 1,086 Advanced Facer Canceler Systems (AFCS) at USPS Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DC) throughout the country.  The AFCS is a mail handling system that faces letter mail by locating the stamp, meter, or indicia.  The AFCS also cancels letter mail, sprays an identification (ID) tag, lifts the image, and sorts letter mail to a set of bins for further processing.  The current AFCS utilizes a mechanical canceler with rotating stamp die to transfer cancellation ink onto the stamp and letter.  Cancellation dies are updated with new dates daily.  The inkjet canceler will use ink jet printing technology to apply cancellation information on each mail piece by spraying tiny ink droplets at high velocity under computer control.  The computer control will ensure automatic update of cancellation dates and provide precise time stamping of individual letters.  Generally speaking, the inkjet canceler will be a retrofit kit for the AFCS.  The Inkjet Canceler will consist of the following subsystems:
1)	Deck Plate Assembly
2)	Two (2) Print Head Assemblies 
3)	Ink Reservoirs and Ink Delivery System 
4)	Control System with corresponding cable assemblies for I/O and power
5)	Two (2) Interface Boards with I/O connectors
6)	Optional Encoder and Encoder Roller Assembly

The Postal Service intends to perform a competitive test to determine if performance described in the technical design requirements of the Statement of Work is achieved.  This will be a limited competition with two prequalified suppliers, Siemens Dematic Postal Automation L.P., PO Box 95080, Arlington, TX  76005-1080 and Video Jet Technologies, Inc., 1500 Mittel Boulevard, Wood Dale, IL  60191-1073.  Any firms interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact these firms directly.

In conjunction with the competitive test, proposals will be submitted in response to the production requirements.  The Postal Service intends to award one firm fixed price contract for the total quantity to the prequalified supplier who offers the best value to the Postal Service, based on established evaluation criteria.

Any other suppliers who have proven technology already in production and are interested in participating in the competitive test of the AFCS-IJC Program must email their request for a copy of the technical design requirements (no later than Friday, April 14, 2003.  In order to be favorably considered for inclusion on our prequalified list for this requirement, the supplier must submit two fully functional prototypes, suggested/required spare parts, and technical documentation (i.e. technical description, installation instructions, user documentation) to the USPS no later than Monday, May 14, 2003.  The competitive test will be conducted in both a Lab and Field environment during the May/June timeframe.  Each supplier will be required to provide technical resources to install, debug, and burn-in their unit.  The USPS will provide a minimum of one (1) week notice to each supplier prior to the installation date.  

At this time, the USPS does not have funding authorization by the USPS Board of Governors (BOG) for this Program.  This authorization is expected at the August BOG meeting.  Some nominal funds may be available to offset costs associated with the competitive test and is subject to negotiation.

ABM Technologies Australia is the only firm with the ability to provide this reporting capability in the timeframe required since they are currently developing the applications necessary to support the model(s) and will assume no learning curve in adding the reporting capability.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Physical and Chemical Properties division (PCPD) of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement of Mass spectra assessment services. Offerors must demonstrate their qualifications, expertise, and experience in mass spectra analysis.  The services shall require assessment of the quality of reported mass spectra using the structure of the compound and known good quality spectra of similar compounds.  The correlation of mass spectra to initial chemical structure cannot be done using computer tools today.  It requires a good deal of experience in examining good and bad spectra.  The minimum requirements for vendors are a degree in chemistry and at least two years of experience analyzing mass spectra data for the purpose of finding errors and confirming structure/ spectral consistency.  Experience with routine mass spectra analysis is not sufficient for this purpose.  Published papers showing research in correlating spectra to structure or documented prior experience with such correlations must be provided. The vendor must have demonstrated the ability to evaluate large quantities of Mass Spectral data finding errors due to common mistakes such as saturation, column degradation, , compound misidentification or transcription.  This ability must be demonstrated by evidence of large mass spectral evaluations in public literature or commercial databases that are available for examination at NIST.  A detailed Statement of Work (SOW) will be available in the solicitation package.  The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from the date of contract award, with the option to extend for four (4) 12-month periods.  This is a small business set aside requirement with a NAICS code of 541990 and a size standard of $6.0 million.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments and all questions and answers relating to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about April 27, 2003 and will only be available on FEDBIZOPS at the above website. 
Potential offers are responsible for accessing the website.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

 IV.  	POSITION DESCRIPTION:
 
 Introduction
 
 USAID-India recently completed its five year strategic plan for 2003-2007, which outlines its strategic objectives and priorities for the next five years. More information on USAID/India?s strategy can be received from the website                                                www.usaid.gov/india <http://www.usaid.gov/india>.  The goal of USAID India's Vulnerable People Strategic Objective (SO 5) is consonant with the Agency's Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance pillar and consistent with India's constitution that guarantees equality across gender, caste and religion, and promotes a rights-based, democratic framework.  Notwithstanding this impressive framework, large elements of the population are regularly denied their rights.  Social acceptability of this discrimination and abuse, combined with weak or non-enforcement of the democratic framework, limits opportunities for vulnerable populations, especially women and children. Creating and increasing access for the poor and marginalized to education and the country's judicial systems are critical to breaking the vicious cycle of abuse, discrimination and poverty, and realizing economic development.  Education is key to enabling the future workforce of men and women to embrace technological changes that can boost their productivity and earnings, and provide escape routes from poverty.  Education is also critically important in furthering democratic values such as tolerance and equality.
 
 India?s primary education sector faces considerable challenges to realize the "universal education" goals of enrolling all children in school by 2003 and increasing the literacy rate to 75% by 2007.  About half of the states and territories, as well as urban areas, were untouched by the educational reform process, resulting in a tremendous diversity in performance.  Performance gaps exist across and within states; between groups of children, with educational outcomes differing considerably between girls and boys; between the poor and the better-off; and between children of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other children. Studies in low-literacy districts in 8 states found that the gender gap in elementary-level achievement was exacerbated by the absence of female teachers, the absence of single-sex schools, the location of schools more than two kilometers from home, inadequate teaching/learning materials, and lack of separate toilets for girls. Parental attitudes discriminate against girls' education.
 
 Underscoring these challenges, India's Tenth Five-Year Plan concludes, ?Our performance in the field of education is one of the most disappointing aspects of our developmental strategy.?  The challenges of India?s basic education sector are broad and deep.  They include finding ways and means to address:
 
 Impacts of rapid urbanization; High drop-out rates as children are needed to earn income for family support; Large numbers of rural villages without reasonable access to schools; Stubbornly high rates of child illiteracy (56% of females and 31% of males age 6 and above) that threaten to continue the legacy of high rates of rural adult illiteracy; Inadequate school infrastructure; High rates of teacher absenteeism; Low competence, motivation, and performance among teachers; Outdated textbooks, syllabi, and curricula; and Weak or non-existent community linkages.
 
 Within USAID?s new SO 5, the two intermediate results which will work with the education sector are:  5.1., Improved Access to Education for Vulnerable Children and  5.3., New and Expanded Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups.  The target group for USAID?s education activities are envisioned to be: 1) out-of-school children in rural and urban areas, with a special focus on girls; 2) school administrators and policy makers in the education sector; and 3) teachers and teacher training facilities and local communities.  As the program grows, it is possible that these target groups will shift and/ or additional groups will be added.
 
 Under Washington-based field-support arrangements, in 1997 USAID/New Delhi initiated modest support in the basic education sector investing in development of gender-sensitized teachers? training module and establishment of a girl?s education resource center in the State of Uttar Pradesh.  Starting in 1999 USAID also provided grant assistance for umbrella arrangements with a U.S. PVO and UN agency with the aim of preventing and eliminating child labor through quality education activities.  The Mission is currently dialoguing with the GOI to define a potential role for USAID support to the GOI?s sponsored universal basic education program called ?Sharva Shikshan Abhayan? (SSA).  The Mission is also initiating a series of pre-implementation activities.  For example, it is promoting use if information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated education to enhance quality including radio interactive instructions.  Possible support to school water and sanitation program to boost girls? participation in schools is also contemplated.  Some discrete research on decentralization and school quality and a companion SSA initiative to engage Indian NGOs/foundations in promoting education in underserved districts and urban areas with high drop-out and rates are also planned for direct support arrangements. Development of activities under the new education strategy will require extensive collaborative analyses and planning, discussions and negotiations with the GOI, as well as with the other major donors in education, given USAID?s newer substantive involvement in this sector.
 
 Duties and Responsibilities of the Position
 
 A USPSC Senior Education Advisor will serve as the senior technical and policy advisor, as well as Team Leader for the USAID/New Delhi Education Sector programs and projects to be designed and implemented under the recently approved new Mission five-year strategy.  USAID expects to support a combination of financing arrangements for these activities, e.g., bilateral grant with the GOI, direct umbrella arrangements, grants/cooperative agreements to international organizations and NGO?s, direct contacts, as well as to rely on global field support arrangements where relevant and practicable.
 
 The specific duties and responsibilities of the Senior Education Advisor will be: Technical and policy advisor to the Mission for the Education program As the Mission expert on education, advise USAID and other USG officials of trends and constraints (e.g., financing, political will and administrative capacity) and provide technical recommendations on opportunities that can promote the education sector agenda in India. Lead in planning/design, negotiation, management, monitoring and evaluation of education program activities (and any related technical/vocational training and higher education initiatives).  The scope of this advice includes issues related to qualify as well as access. Carry-out and support policy dialogue on issues such as financing and quality with GOI (central, state and municipal) officials and donors in consultation with Mission staff. Prepare technical and other reports and draft speeches, concept papers, position papers, talking points and briefs for the Mission Director, other senior USAID officials and the Ambassador on education sector issues. Draft or oversee the drafting of project scopes of work and program descriptions to compete and award acquisition and/or assistance instruments to implement technical programs in the areas highlighted above.
 
 Program Management and Oversight
 
 Provide leadership to a multidisciplinary team as well as to partner implementing organizations in achieving Strategic 5, IR 1 to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies. Supervise the education sector team and the FSN-Education Officer?s monitoring of program and project implementation activities.  Provide policy and operational guidance to contractors and grantees.  Review, critique and approve annual work plans and related financial documentation for compliance with USAID requirements. Identify and work with contractors/grantees and GOI counterparts to resolve issues affecting the achievement of results. Supervise the development of data collection systems for monitoring of program/project impacts. Review and supervise preparation of requisite USAID documents, e.g., semi-annual and annual program performance reports. Provide substantive input in establishing performance monitoring systems for results frameworks. Perform or supervise the conduct of program evaluations and assessments.
 
 Coordination
 
i)	Ensure effective coordination of USAID-funded activities with those of other donors working with the GOI.   Promote convergence and expansion of effective strategies and approaches that can expand coverage and quality of education services (including those being promoted through the use of information and communication technologies) especially for vulnerable populations (poor/females/out-of-school?s).
ii)	Develop, nurture and sustain close collaborative, professional relationships with senior (secretary-level) GOI central, state and municipal level officials, other mainline donors like the World Bank and the European Community, corporate philanthropic foundations (in the US and in India), international organizations and leading education research institutions. 
iii)	Enlist support from other donors, senior government officials, and non-government organizations for policy changes that will overcome program implementation issues or facilitate replication of positive program results. Carryout and support policy dialogue with senior GOI officials and other bilateral and/or multilateral donor officials in consultation with the USDH director, OSD and the USAID/Director. 
iv)	Develop and maintain a collaborative, professional relationship with, senior members of the US Embassy, senior host government officials at both the national and provincial levels, representatives of the U.S. Department of Labor, the US Customs Service and other donor organizations supporting human rights programs in these countries and with USAID-funded implementing partners. 
v)	Represent USAID at donor and other international forums on education issues.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.


Requested Response:  

Parties interested in providing pricing information for past conservation technical services need to respond by accessing the TspCost Web page on the internet.  The web address is http://tspcost.sc.egov.usda.gov/  or link from http://sc.egov.usda.gov Information and instructions for populating the database are shown there.

Please submit questions about this notice by sending an email message to: edward.biggers@usda.gov.  Questions may also be sent by U.S. mail to: Edward M. Biggers, Jr., Director-Management Services Division, Room 5221-S, 1400 Independence Avenue., SW, Washington, DC 20250.

Responses must be received by April 11, 2003.

Statement of Needs:

Overview:

This is a total small business set-aside.  For this procurement a company is considered small if it has gross average annual sales for the proceeding three years of less than $6.0 million.  All responsible small businesses may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code for this action is 541430, Graphic Design Services, Size Standard $6.0 Million.  The Office of Personnel Management requires the services of a commercial vendor to provide design (consistent with OPM’s established corporate image) for a wide range of products (i.e.: posters, charts, banners, flyers, pamphlets, books, etc…).  The vendor must be available/reachable 24/7.  Some orders may also require production of banners for indoor/outdoor use (1’x 10’- 4’x25’) output and mounting of charts and posters on foam core (or equal), up to 3’x4’, conversion of printing files for use on the Internet, and miscellaneous other graphic arts services.  This procurement will lead to the award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a period of performance of 1 year from the date of award.


Schedule:

Approximately 50% of the orders will be placed in the afternoon to late evening with delivery required by 8 am of the next day, 30% will require delivery within 2-3 days and the remaining 20% will be for 5 days or more.

If delivery is not made as required the order may no longer be required, and therefore the Government will render no payment.  If the product is still required only normal charges will be paid for the work performed (no surcharges).  Additionally, if the product does not match the approved proofs or furnished directions the Government reserves the right to reject the order and render no payment.

Contacts:

The vendor must provide contact names and phone numbers, as many orders will be placed late in the day or after normal business hours.

Pickup & Deliveries:
 
Contractor will pickup and deliver all materials to the Office of Personnel Management.  When possible government furnished material and deliverables will be transmitted electronically via email, to an FTP site, or as mutually agreed.

Frequency of Orders:

OPM is unable to predict with any certainty the frequency or orders, generally 1 - 4 orders will be placed each month.  Orders will be placed via telephone accompanied with a task order from the Publications Services Division.

Average number of orders per month will be 2.  Our estimate of the types of orders that will be placed is as follows:

10 invitations/cards (OPM to print orders that require printing/silk screening versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract) 1 color, stock furnished.

4 posters (OPM to print orders that require printing versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract), 2 – 4 colors, gloss finish stock, mounted on foam core, 2 – 10 copies for electronic production.

6 orders for charts/graphs, averaging 5 –10 products per order, 2 – 4 colors, matte finish stock, mounted on foam core, 3’ x 4’.

2 books, 48 – 250 pages (OPM to print), 2 – 4 colors.

6 banners, some with 2 or more products with the same or different images, 4-color process.

4 pamphlets, 4 – 16 pages (OPM to print), 2 – 4 colors.

2 orders requiring conversion of files for use on the Internet, these products will normally be the books or pamphlets produced under this contract.


Government Furnished Material:

When the Government deems it possible all materials will be furnished to the vendor electronically.  Otherwise, the vendor must pickup the GFM from the Office of Personnel Management or a mutually agreed upon location.


Samples:

When submitting your bid please provide samples of no less than 5 previous products designed by your company.


Proposal Preparation Requirements:

In submitting an offer for this project, the contractor must provide:

Technical Proposal (Original and two copies)
Resumes of key personnel
A description and samples of similar work performed in the last 24 months
Customer references including names and telephone numbers of company contacts
Timeline for completion of tasks and technical plan describing how work would be accomplished.
Minimum level of work/reimbursement needed to perform under this contract.
Price per hour for design work.
Price to produce products listed under Frequency of Orders (samples of these products are available for viewing at OPM in Room 5H35).

Vendor must address the following issues in their proposal:

Means of providing after hours service and contact information.

Evaluation:

A blanket purchase agreement will be established with the offeror OPM determines offers the best value.  Award from this solicitation will be made on a “best value” basis. In making that determination, selecting the successful offeror, the technical factors bear significantly more importance than cost, but cost could be the deciding factor if there are no essential technical differences among the most highly rated offers.


Technical Evaluation:

Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria. They are listed in descending order of importance:

Experience/ education of key personnel 
Quality of past performance based on input from references
Quality and relevance of plan for accomplishing work and other relevant information
Experience in performing similar projects
delivery method (photocopy or digital transmission)


Cost Evaluation:

<DESC>Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-4142.  TREATMENT FOR DISPOSITION OF INEEL NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES. Contact Mr. Scott A. Drewes. BBWI, a managing and operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is seeking an expression of interest from firms to provide transportation, treatment, and disposal of non-radioactive Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and industrial waste generated at the INEEL. Treatment facilities must be privately owned and operated outside of areas managed by DOE and must have a mechanism for disposal of the final waste forms.  Appropriate permits and authorizations obtained at vendor expense must be in place prior to award of the contract.  The amount of waste for which treatment is sought under this announcement is approximately 377.6 cubic meters per year (average of last two calendar years) for an estimated 5 years.  The wastes to be treated include bulk and non-bulk liquids, solids, sludge, debris, and particulate material.  The wastes may also include asbestos, used oil, universal waste, aerosols, and cylinders of toxics, poisons, corrosives and freons. A multitude of EPA waste codes and/or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be associated with the waste. There are no radioactive components associated with the waste. The wastes have been grouped based on EPA waste codes, PCBs, physical and chemical properties, and/or potential known treatment processes to meet disposal standards.  The treatment groups and estimated yearly waste volumes include universal waste (56.6 cubic meters); used oil - bulk and non-bulk (96.0 cubic meters); direct disposal – non-bulk (1.7 cubic meters), bulk (51.0 cubic meters); stabilization/solidification – non-bulk (0.8 cubic meters); macroencapsulation – non-bulk (9.5 cubic meters), bulk (108.0 cubic meters); wastewater treatment – non-bulk (6.1 cubic meters); thermal treatment - non-bulk (37.6 cubic meters); PCB treatment – incineration, bulk and non-bulk (4.0 cubic meters); mercury treatment – retort, non-bulk (4.2 cubic meters); recyclable nickel-cadmium batteries – non-bulk (0.8 cubic meters); and specialty waste – non-bulk – dioxin wastes (0.3 cubic meters); reactive wastes – elemental sodium (1.0 cubic meters).  Services to be contracted include transportation of the INEEL waste to an appropriate treatment/storage/disposal facility, performing any necessary sorting, sizing, and additional detailed characterization of waste required prior to treatment, processing the waste to meet applicable regulatory standards and requirements, any interim storage at the treatment facility, and transport and disposal of the treated product and any residuals in a permitted and authorized facility.  The treated waste must meet all regulatory and other applicable requirements for disposal.  Additional services that may be required include the provision of equipment, staff, and expertise for time critical removal actions and special equipment rental services (e.g., tankers, roll-off boxes and gondolas), as requested.   Development of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and treatment/disposal of waste under the contract(s) will be contingent on availability of necessary funding.  The RFP, if developed, will include more detailed waste stream information.  Qualified respondents must provide two printed copies of the following information: company name, address, point of contact, email, phone/fax numbers, and a concise summary report that describes the capabilities of the respondent and a listing of all similar recent activities complete with reference names and telephone numbers, and copies of permits and authorizations held including RCRA permits, authority to accept CERCLA remediation wastes, and authority to accept TSCA wastes.  Respondents who provide insufficient information will not be considered further.  The expression of interest is totally separate from all other solicitations involving facilities or services for the treatment of INEEL wastes.  Firms interested in responding should forward the requisite information to:  Mr. Scott A. Drewes, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 4142, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-4142.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Modify a Contract
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-95-00134-00 (Administration of Justice Support program “AOJS”), with American Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST) to extend the contract for nine months of additional level of effort.   The extended contract will fund activities within the scope of the present contract where the contractor has concluded the main activities.  However, the extension is required to allow the contractor to continue to support the entities responsible for sustaining and upgrading AOJS innovations in the two pilot courts:  the Judicial Information Center and the National Center for Judicial Studies, which will be critical to the effectiveness of AOJSII. 

For this procurement, the U.S. government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  The extension of AOJS will secure the sustainability of its successes by allowing for the completion of the following:  (1) Continue the monitoring, evaluation, and validation of court administration procedures implemented in the two pilot courts; (2) Continue the testing and validation of the tailored court automation software systems and the associated human resource re-engineering procedures to ensure that the applications and procedures are robust; sustainable, and suitable for adoption at the national level in both large and small courts; (3) Continue the monitoring, evaluation and validation of the utilization of the information management reports by senior judicial/management staff to improve court performance directly related to civil case delay reduction; (4) Extend the availability of expatriate court administration expert capabilities until court administration and court automation solutions are robust, proven, reliable, and suitable for replication nationally; (5) 
Complete the launch of the website for the National Center for Judicial Studies and provide relevant technical training to selected staff members so that the Center has the capacity to maintain and to administer the website; (6) Assist the newly-founded Assessment and Evaluation Unit and the Curriculum Development Committee of the National Center for Judicial Studies to institutionalize best practices related to program design, course development, and training evaluation; (7) Enhance the administrative and research capacity of the National Center for Judicial Studies by re-engineering the systems for the Center’s Case Bank; and (8) Monitor and evaluate the application and impact of the technical and management training AOJS has provided to date, and provide any required additional training to ensure the sustainability of Project systems and strategies in the partner work units.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>S -- UtilityInfrastructureServicesRequest for Information/Sources Sought
<DESC>The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is seeking sources that are capable and interested in participating in privatization of on-base utility distribution infrastructure.  The purpose of this announcement is two fold:  1) to ascertain if there is a viable interest from industry in participating; and 2) to ascertain if any of the privatization solicitations can be set aside for a) small business, b) 8a small business or c) HUBZone small business.  Decisions will be made by USAFA on a utility-by-utility basis.  If viable interest is not shown for a particular utility system, a solicitation for that utility will not be issued.  North American Industrial Classification Codes of 221122 (Electric Power Distribution), 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution), 221310 (Water Supply Systems) and 221320 (Sewer Treatment Facilities) apply.  Corresponding small business size standards are 4 million megawatts, 500 employees, $6M in sales, and $6M in sales, respectively.  Parties interested in acquiring utility systems and providing utility distribution services at USAFA should provide a separate statement of interest for each utility.  Each separate statement of interest shall identify the specific system(s) for which there is interest and for which industry provides separate responses to the questions identified below.  Firms that are either small business or 8a or HUBZone small business need to identify that fact and indicate in which of the three listed small business categories they qualify. The USAFA utilities involved are electricity; natural gas; water; and wastewater (collection, treatment and non-potable water distribution).    If an offeror is interested in multiple systems, separate responses should be provided for each system.  In addition, interested parties are required to provide information regarding experience and qualifications for operating utility systems for each of the systems of interest.  Contractor selection will NOT be made on the basis of information submitted, rather we will decide if sufficient viable interest exists to warrant issuing RFPs or if any limitation of participation to small business, 8a or HUBZone small business applies.  Each utility system will be separately solicited.  Please be advised the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) apply to this procurement and interested parties should reference the draft Request For Proposal (RFP) template at the following website for information regarding terms and conditions.  The draft template RFP can be found at http://www.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CEO/Contracts/UtilPrivatization/UPTemplates.htm.  Specifically, parties are advised the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1, Alt I, found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm will apply when the entity is providing services where the rates are not set by law or regulation and acknowledge understanding that acceptance of this clause is required to be considered responsive to any subsequent RFP.  Responses will be used to assist in refining the acquisition strategy and subsequent decisions regarding future issuance of a full and open competitive RFP, a set-aside RFP, a sole source RFP, or, if no viable interest, not issuing an RFP.  If viable responses are not received, the Government has the discretion to determine no market interest exists and no subsequent RFPs be issued (again, on a utility-by-utility basis). Specific responses to the following are needed in order for your firm to be considered “viable” in providing an offer for services under this program. Provide: (1) System of interest: (a) Electric Utility Distribution System; (b) Natural Gas Utility Distribution System; (c) Potable Water Utility Distribution System; (d) Wastewater Utility Distribution System; (2) Your status regarding your authority to support this service: (a) Regulated utility and service is within certificated area of service; (b) Regulated utility providing nonregulated service for this area of service; (d) Regulated utility and service is not within certificated area of service; (e) Non-regulated utility for the service of interest; (3) Classification of your company: (a) Publicly owned utility; (b) Investor owned utility; (c) Cooperative owned utility; (d) Publicly owned and traded company – not a utility; (e) Privately owned company; (f) Limited Liability Corporation; (g) C-Corp; (h) Other, Please Describe; (4) Offeror acknowledges acceptance of application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation terms and conditions included in the RFP template. (5) Acknowledgement that you may be required to comply with the Cost Accounting Standards; (6) If you propose to provide nonregulated service within your proposed service area, will your entity accept the Federal Disputes Clause FAR 52.233-1 Alt 1;  (7) Indicate if your firm or entity is or is not a small business, or 8a or HUBZone small business.  (Not-for-profit entities cannot be a small business.)  - Responses that indicate insufficient capabilities will not be further considered. Due date for response is 30 April 2003.  Responses should be addressed to:  Margaret Wages, USAF Academy, 10MSG/LGCA, 8110 Industrial Drive, Suite 200, USAF Academy CO 80840-2315; telephone numbers are shown below.

<SUBJECT>B -- Variable Laser Eye/Sensor Protection technology
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of variable laser-protective transparencies for planning purposes.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of Variable Laser Eye/Sensor Protection technology.  The envisioned system should utilize “light valve” technology to provide rapidly adjustable protection for electro-optical sensors and personnel against threats posed by laser designators and ranging devices.  Given that capability, Combat Air Forces could ensure mission accomplishment in a battlefield laser threat environment with the additional benefit of force protection at deployed locations.   The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEFB is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce and certify an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating a transparency constructed with Suspended Particle Device technology that can absorb, diffuse, or reflect laser light sufficiently to prevent injury to the eyes of personnel or damage to electro-optical devices, i.e. Charge Coupled Devices.  The transparency would protect against laser energy in the visible spectrum to far infrared spectrum, ideally wavelengths from .4 microns to 11 microns.  While incorporated into personnel protection systems, such as crew visors, goggles, or vehicle/aircraft transparencies, the technology should be controllable by the users or by automatic means, (i.e. photovoltaic sensors) across the visible spectrum.  The system should also allow full color, unimpeded field of view in ambient lighting and while activated against laser energy.   The system should operate from either alternating or direct current, offer low power consumption, adjust uniformly and instantaneously, be durable, flexible, and withstand a temperature range of  -40C to 100C. 

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN 27 April 2003 to Capt. Patrick Sullivan, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Capt. Sullivan can be reached at (208) 828-3511.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>Description
I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.106, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

II. This solicitation, DCMA01-03-Q-0003, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  A fixed price bilateral Purchase Order or Delivery Order is anticipated to be awarded

III. The solicitation document and incorporated provision/clauses are those in effect through FAC # 2001-11. 

IV. This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered. Applicable NAICS – 541611.

V. A list of Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) and their items are:  CLIN 0001: Review and Assess Adequacy of Existing DCMA Customer Outreach and Customer Satisfaction Measurement Activities and Processes. CLIN 0002: Contrast Existing DCMA Customer Relationship Management Practices and Procedures with Progressive Public and Private Sector Service Based Organizations.  CLIN 0003:  Develop an Integrated Customer Relations Process. CLIN 0004 Travel to be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation. CLINS 0001 and 0002 deliverables as well as a mid-performance briefing are required to be delivered 30 calendar days after contract start and CLIN 0003 deliverable is required 60 calendar days after contract start. 

VI. Description follows of  Performance Based Statement of Work Requirements.  

Mission/Business:  The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is an independent Combat Support Agency that provides a variety of contract management services to Army, Navy and Air Force buying activities and defense agencies, as well as civilian agencies.  These services include pre-contract award support, such as Acquisition Planning and Support Services, and a wide range of post-award contract management functions identified in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.302 and Defense FAR Supplement.  

	Workload/Business Base:  The DCMA contract management average workload consists of  490,000 contracts with a total unliquidated dollar obligation of approximately $119 billion.  Contracts range in size and complexity from major acquisition systems (ACAT I & II programs) to critical system component and spare parts contracts.  DCMA manages the full range of fixed price and cost type contracts, as well as Other Transactions and Grants.

	Workforce:  DCMA’s workforce performs contract management functions across the United States and overseas.  The organizational structure is comprised of the Headquarters, three Districts (East, West and International), approximately 60 Contract Management Offices (CMOs), and several hundred subordinate residencies.  The CMOs and subordinate offices are located in, or close by, defense contractors performing work for the Department of Defense and multiple civilian agencies.

	Background:  At present, DCMA is transforming its management and operating policies, processes and procedures to better align Agency performance with the needs and priorities of customer organizations in support of the warfighter.  DCMA’s success in a performance-based operating mode will be driven not by multiple, internally developed performance metrics, but by the success of the Agency and its primary operating elements, the CMOs, in both understanding individual customer needs and priorities, and delivering services and products that are keyed to those needs and priorities.  The CMOs, as direct service providers, will require a means of managing or gauging their performance against customer stated priorities.  The HQ and District organizations will also require a less discrete, more global means of gauging the quality and effectiveness of customer support activities at the CMO level.

	Existing DCMA/customer relationship building, outreach (marketing) and customer satisfaction assessment vehicles and activities can be grouped into five different categories:  

1)	Senior level customer visits by HQ and District personnel (OSD Senior Executives, Service Acquisition Executives (SAEs), Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Buying Activity Senior Leaders
2)	Monthly telephone surveys of key customer personnel such as Program Managers (PMs), Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), and Inventory Managers conducted by District personnel
3)	A Web-Based customer satisfaction and feedback tool
4)	Customer Liaison Representatives (CLRs) co-located with major DCMA customers 
5)	Visits to senior customer representatives by CMO Commanders and senior staff members.  

Each of these five categories of customer relationship building and customer outreach activities provides customer information and insights, but the shift to performance-based management operating principles will require a more sophisticated, integrated, informative and real-time feedback methodology to help all levels of the organization both understand customer expectations, and gauge the adequacy of DCMA performance in response to expressed customer expectations.  A new and enhanced customer relationship management system is needed that will provide a clear understanding of near term, as well as emerging, customer priorities and expectations.

Required Performance Outcomes:

(1)	Review and assess the adequacy of DCMA’s existing customer outreach and customer satisfaction measurement activities and processes.  This includes:  

1)	The processes and procedures designed to assist DCMA in understanding and responding to customer needs, both near and longer term
2)	The process, tools and metrics used to assess customer satisfaction
3)	Processes that encompass marketing the variety of DCMA products and services to ensure sufficient customer knowledge of DCMA capabilities

(2)	Contrast DCMA’s customer relationship management practices and procedures previously described with progressive public and private sector, service-based organizations.  Identify gaps between the DCMA activities and processes, and those employed by progressive public and private sector organizations.

(3)	Based upon the two foregoing reviews, and a review of existing literature on customer relationship management policies and practices, develop an integrated customer relations process that will provide DCMA:  

1)	A more useful and integrated customer knowledge base, and the necessary processes and procedures for accumulating, storing and utilizing customer information at each of the three DCMA organizational levels
2)	A process for managing and gauging the level of DCMA performance against expressed customer expectations and desired outcomes within a performance-based organization.  (The process and customer satisfaction gauge must be useful and appropriate at each of the three DCMA organizational levels, CMO level with buying activity Program Managers, PCOs, Inventory Managers, et al, and District and HQ organizational elements with successively higher level customer organizations and senior personnel (OSD Senior Executives, Service Acquisition Executives, PEOs, and Buying Activity Senior Leaders, et al.)
3)	A fully integrated DCMA marketing program spanning the customer base

VII. Period of Performance:  Sixty calendar days after contract award. 

VIII. Deliverables:  CLIN 0001 and 0002 Deliverables and Mid-performance Briefing will be due 30 calendar days after contract start and CLIN 0003 Deliverable is due 60 calendar days after contract start.

IX.  Date(s) and Place(s) of Services: Services will be performed at the contractor’s facility with visits to DCMA HQ.
