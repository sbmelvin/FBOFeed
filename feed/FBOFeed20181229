The identified facility condition deficiencies ( F s  and  D s ) negatively impact the Medical Centers fire safety readiness, compliance with building code requirements, and compliance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) life safety code as well as Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).  The project location will be across several floors and numerous buildings on campus (specifically main building 110, 111, 118, 95, 86, 82, 81, 79, 35, 20, 19, 18, 14, and the tunnel). Functions included in this project include maintenance, safety, and engineering, however all areas and functions of the Medical Center campus will be supported by the corrections of FCA fire related deficiencies (fire alarm & life safety) found in the existing infrastructure.  Renovation will be subject to the accessibility of the systems being corrected, however none is expected or planned for.  A/E(s) signing drawings must be licensed.

STATEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
