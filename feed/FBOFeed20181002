<DESC>LADAR Innovative Development and Research (LIDR)
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE/NEEDS: The objective of this effort is to conduct innovative research and development (R&amp;D) of electro-optical components and technology, furthering advanced warfighting capabilities and supporting the existing and emerging needs of the Air Force and DoD. It is expected that these will be accomplished through laboratory experimentation, component fabrication and analysis, system integration, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), field and flight testing, signal analysis, target fabrication, and evaluation. The primary goal of this effort is to develop advanced sensor technologies and techniques successfully operable in contested and denied environments meeting Air Force air superiority, global precision attack, rapid global mobility, special operations, and global integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) service core function needs.</p>
<p>LADAR Innovative Development and Research (LIDR) will continue to advance state-of-the-art active and associated passive electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) technologies, seek synergies with active and passive radio frequency (RF) technologies, and define and test the integrability of these technologies in support of the Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter. The primary focus of current Air Force needs is enhanced combat identification and high resolution wide area three-dimensional imaging (WATI). This research is organized across four primary technology areas: Synthetic Aperture Laser Radar (LADAR), Vibration Sensing, Direct Detection 3 Dimensional (3D) LADAR, and multiple modalities in a single LADAR sensor.</p>
<p>Asynchronous Geiger Mode LADAR Receiver Development (A-GMLRD)</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE/NEEDS: The objective of this effort is to develop asynchronous Geiger mode LiDAR receivers and Geiger mode laser communications (lasercom) receivers for military use, supporting AF research efforts. The Asynchronous Geiger Mode LADAR Receiver Development (A-GMLRD) project will develop a packaged light detection and ranging (LiDAR) receiver system for laser detection and ranging (LADAR) imaging systems and lasercom applications. The result will yield a photon sensitive receiver capable of providing high precision timing measurements to objects within the sensor field of view (FOV), supporting AF sensor development programs and lasercom programs.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - APG, Natick Contracting Division, Milford, MA, 01757, intends to issue the following synopsis W911QY-18-R-0044 as a Small Business Set-aside for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Warehouse Operations Management, Supply Chain Management, and supporting Logistics Program Management. The Government intends to issue one (1) single award Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) commercial contract. Maximum contract value will be $99 million over the five (5) year life of the contract.
<p>A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOpps on March19, 2018, where more than two small businesses responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements. Based on this and other Market Research, a determination was made to set the effort aside 100% for Small Business. Therefore, only qualified Small Business offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This requirement will provide Warehouse Operations Management, Supply Chain Management, and supporting Logistics Program Management for the Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) as well as Training and Fielding required to support the Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (TUAS) Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, as well as its domestic and foreign customers. FoSUAS provides support for Group I UAS products, primarily the RQ-20A (Puma) and RQ-11B (Raven), make up the current fleet. In the future, Group I UAS products will consist of the SRR, MRR, and LRR aircraft as well as the H-GCS. The US Army is not currently fielding any Group II UAS, however there may be support required in the future. Group II Aircraft weigh between 21 and 55 pounds. The current contract that supports these efforts will end in June 2019. <br /><br />The current fleet of SUAS includes:</p>
<p>&bull; 2175 RQ-11B systems in the inventory<br />&bull; 338 RQ-20A systems in the inventory<br />&bull; 34 Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) SUAS Desktop Training Systems. These Desktop Training Systems are embedded in select active duty and reserve component installations worldwide.<br /><br />A brief synopsis of the support required for these systems as well as future modified systems, and new SUAS acquisitions are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Facilities Provide</strong> a climate controlled facility for warehouse, repair, and logistic services to take place (hereafter referred to as the SUAS Contractor Depot) within 25 miles one-way distance from the PdO TUAS official duty station (Redstone Arsenal, AL). Currently there are Government representatives that work in the ICP/warehouse facility on an on-going basis. That oversight is expected to continue during this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Logistics Support</strong> provides Warehouse Operations Management, Supply Chain Management, and other supporting services necessary to sustain the current program managed systems identified above and any newly acquired or program managed systems during the life of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Logistics Support Services</strong> maintain the currency of the FoSUAS Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). The IMS shall contain the networked tasks necessary, in real-time, to ensure successful program/contract execution of the Contractor Logistics Support Services.</p>
<p><strong>SUAS Training</strong> Conduct Flight Training at Government provided training in both CONUS and OCONUS locations following Government provided schedules, Training Support Packages (TSPs), lesson plans, and Periods of Instruction (POI). Student to Instructor ratio shall not exceed 4:1 during any flight training event and 16:1 during any classroom training event unless approved by the government. Provide experienced instructors with a minimum one year practical SUAS Master Trainer/Instructor experience. SUAS Instructor candidates must obtain certification on all current program managed products and receive Project Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PM-UAS) Government Flight Representative (GFR) approval prior to conducting training.</p>
<p><strong>SUAS Fielding</strong> The Contractor shall conduct SUAS fielding activities by performing general supply transactions using appropriate DoD documentation</p>
<p><strong>SUAS Warehousing</strong> Conduct warehousing operations on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>SUAS Repairs</strong> Provide Repair Technicians necessary to perform repair services for the current program managed fleet, future modified systems, and new SUAS acquisitions. Repair Technicians must complete Contractor provided SUAS Training Program. SUAS system quantities are referenced above</p>
<p><strong>SUAS Field Service Representatives (FSRs)</strong> Provide FSR's to perform Contractor Logistics assistance tasks such as training, fielding, repairing, or supply chain management for worldwide contingency operations at the direction of the Government.</p>
<p>The approximate percentage of effort in each area of focus is: Flight Training - 30%, Contractor Logistics (includes repair) - 60%, Technical/Program Management - 10%.<br /><br />A Single award, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is planned to support this effort. The contract Ordering Period is five years. Specific date(s) and place(s) of delivery, acceptance and FOB point will be specified in the individual Task orders. The IDIQ contract award is currently scheduled for June 2019, and shall have a cumulative maximum ceiling of $99M for all orders.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. No response to this notice is required, and non-responding will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued. Proposals will be due 30 days after release of the RFP. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation.</p>
<p>Any questions and/or inquiries may be submitted ONLY by e-mail to Trisha Scott, at trisha.r.scott.civ@mail.mil or Michael D'Alessandro at michael.dalessandro6.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>The closing date of this notice is October 18, 2018. Offeror must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) database before an award. If the offeror is not registered in SAM it may do so at https://www.sam.gov The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS FOR SPECIALIZED A-E SERVICES
BUREAU OF RECLAMATION


The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, has a need for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for architectural and Engineering Services (A-E), Design Services for the Boise River Basin feasibility study and associated environmental compliance activities. This procurement will result in a single award, IDIQ contract for multi-discipline A-E services in support of feasibility study(ies) to explore potential increased surface water storage opportunities behind Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, and/or Lucky Peak Dams, which are within the Boise River System in Southwestern Idaho.

The comprehensive scope of the A-E services shall include documented experience, professional registration, and applicable expertise in comparable feasibility studies and associated environmental compliance.  The awarded IDIQ contract base services will include professional A-E services with the ordering period of five years for services from contract award.  The guaranteed minimum for the contract term is $20,000.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to negotiate firm-fixed price task orders under this contract.  However, the Government reserves the right to award other than firm-fixed price task orders if the need arises.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year up to a maximum of $4,000,000 for the entire contract term.  Estimated start date is December 2018.

This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The Government will only accept qualifications from small business concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit qualifications packages. The Small Business size standard classification is North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330, Architectural and Engineering Services.  The Government seeks the most highly qualified firm to perform the required services. Selection of this firm will be made in accordance with the below selection criteria. The awarded contract will be subject to specific provisions addressing the avoidance of organizational conflicts of interest, including, WBR 1452.209-80 Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  The prime firm for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  All contractors are advised that registration in System for Award Management (SAM) Database is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the SAM Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the SAM Web site: https://www.sam.gov

Interviews may be scheduled with firms that rate as the most highly qualified. Firms selected for participation in interviews may be asked to clarify information contained in the SF-330 submittal. Elaborate presentations are not desired.

Architect and Engineer services that may be required under this contract include but are not limited to: perform public scoping and outreach; perform topographic survey, modeling, and analysis; conduct feasibility-level studies; identify, formulate, and/or develop non-structural alternative(s); develop feasibility-level designs and cost estimates, including related studies, field investigations, surveying and mapping, evaluations, consultations, and conceptual designs; analyze alternatives; perform economic analyses; perform environmental compliance (including preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement, Biological Assessment, supporting documentation for National Historic Preservation Act) and permitting requirements with local, state, and Federal agencies; conduct and assist in project management; perform technical writing; and prepare construction documents.  Details on the required services will be provided in individual work orders.

Through the screening work performed thus far in FY18, a potential raise at Anderson Ranch Dam appears to be the most attractive, so initial task order efforts are focused on Anderson Ranch Dam and Reservoir.  Analysis of alternatives supporting the feasibility study for Anderson Ranch Dam and Reservoir will take approximately six months to complete and must be completed prior to the initiation of formal environmental compliance activities. Pre-Notice of Intent (NOI) environmental compliance activities will be performed in parallel with feasibility determination efforts.  Formal environmental compliance activities associated with an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) shall take no longer than one year from issuance of NOI to finalization of an EIS and Record of Decision (ROD).  Projected high level schedule milestones are as follows:

Dec 2018	Award AE IDIQ and Task Order 1
May 2019	Initiate environmental compliance
June 2019	Complete analysis of alternatives
Nov 2019	Publish Draft EIS
Mar 2020	Publish Final EIS
May 2020	Complete ROD
Jun 2020	Finalize Feasibility Report
Jul 2020	Commence formal Department of the Interior reviews
Aug 31, 2020	PNRO deadline for feasibility determination

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-265 (Program Office for F/A-18 and EA-18G Aircraft) intends to solicit and negotiate a firm-fixed-price order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-16-G-0001 to the Boeing Company (TBD) to incorporate ECP 6516 "Advanced Cockpit System (ACS) Upgrade" into F/A-18E/F/G aircraft.</p>
<p>The ACS installs a 10x19 Large Area Display (LAD) into the forward and aft cockpits of F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft. The ACS LAD replaces the 5x5 forward and aft Advanced Multipurpose Displays, the 8x10 aft Advanced Multipurpose Display, the Upfront Control Display Replacement, and the Multipurpose Color Display Replacement. To accommodate the LAD, the Head Up Display (HUD) and MARS HUD camera will be replaced with a Low Profile Head Up Display (LPHUD) and new configuration HUD camera, and the Engine Fuel Display/Replacement (EFD/EFDR) will be replaced with a Low Profile Engine Fuel Display (LPEFD). The Standby Display/Repeater (RSD/RSDR) will be added to aircraft that do not already have it incorporated. The High Speed Video Network (HSVN) Digital Video Recorder (HDVR) is a required prerequisite equipment for the ACS. The ACS is part of the overall Block III upgrade.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304 (C) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Boeing is the designer, developer, and manufacturer; and as such, has the manufacturing knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill this requirement within the time required. This announcement is for informational purposes only. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact the Boeing Company directly.</p>

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing/repair knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition/repair of the part from the approved source(s).

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) Region 5, intends to sole source to:</p>
<p><br />Aquifer, Inc.<br />21 Lafayette St., Suite 230<br />Lebanon, New Hampshire 03766</p>
<p>This requirement is for the completion of a set on online interactive case-based learning modules for health care providers that provide CME educating on the prevalence and impact of trauma, and trauma-informed care. Aquifer (formerly MedU) is the only responsible source and no other supplier of services will satisfy the requirements of this contract. Further, there is an unusual and compelling urgency as we are in the middle of pilot-testing the cases in coordination with the Office of the Surgeon General. Aquifer was the contractor selected by full and open competition to do the work provided in the original SOW. Due to changes in scope required by the government, the work could not be completed before the end of the period of performance of the final option year. The work is entirely linked to the contractor's proprietary content development, learning management system, and integration into their extensive network of academic medical centers for dissemination. Aquifer is the only contractor capable of completing the remaining tasks and fulfilling the deliverables.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to complete work started by current contractor Aquifer, Inc., a multiyear task order to produce and implement an online set of interactive clinical trauma-informed care training cases for health care providers.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement addressing their specific abilities regarding this requirement. The email subject line must reference "Trauma-Informed Care Training for Healthcare Providers: Online Clinical Cases". All responses are due by September 07, 2018, at NOON EST and can be sent to Azeb Mengistu at azeb.mengistu@psc.hhs.gov . A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Repair &amp; Alterations Services contract for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Public Building Service, Region 5, throughout the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  This acquisition will result in multiple contract awards divided into various geographical zones within these three states.  General Contractors (GC) will be eligible to submit for more than one zone.
<p>Services will include, but are not limited to: interior and exterior renovations; office space build-outs; heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, to include controls; electrical; mechanical; plumbing; fire suppression; fire and security systems; communications; site-work; millwork; landscaping; fencing; masonry; concrete; asphalt paving; storm drainage; asbestos and lead abatement; mold and limited soil remediation, and other related work. All work to be performed under the awarded IDIQ contracts will be in accordance with individual task order requirements, including specifications and drawings provided for each project. It is anticipated that multiple contract awards will be made as a result of this procurement.</p>
<p>The contract will be for one base year, with four (4), one-year options that may be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Once an IDIQ contract is awarded, task orders will be issued for specific projects.</p>
<p>The procurement is set-aside for Small Businesses only. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) with a size standard of $36.5 million.  It is expected there will be a guaranteed minimum of $2,000 for the base year only.  The maximum ordering limitation per contract per year will be $7,500,000.00.  A bid bond will not be required with offer submissions, however, a bid bond as well as performance and payment bonding will be required at the task order level when applicable.  As such, each offeror may be asked to provide a signed letter from their bonding company which shows the maximum amount the firm can be bonded per project, and the firm's maximum aggregate bonding capability as part of the proposal submission.  There is no guarantee for dollar value of work.</p>
<p>This is a negotiated procurement; there will not be a public bid opening.  Award(s) will be made to responsible GC(s) whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and could provide the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and line item prices. For this procurement, the technical factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. The technical factors will include: (1) Experience as a General Contractor on Repair and Alteration Projects; (2) Project Management Plan; (3) Staffing Plan and Qualifications of Key Personnel; and (4) Past Performance as a General Contractor on Repair and Alteration Projects. The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if necessary.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or about November 1, 2018. There will be a pre-proposal conference conducted, possibly more than one at various sites, to discuss the preparation of a competitive proposal and to understand the total result desired by the Government.  Specific dates and times of preproposal conference(s) will be contained in the solicitation and will require those wishing to attend to RSVP.</p>
<p>The due date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the solicitation.  There will be an electronic and hard copy submission with which the solicitation will explain in further detail.  The solicitation will be available for download through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov). Offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring FBO for amendments or additional information. All interested contractors must register with FBO in order to view sensitive but unclassified information.  All government contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting an offer. You may access SAM at the following URL: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Once you have registered with SAM, you will be required to register with FBO. No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to Joe Daniero, Contracting Officer, at joe.daniero@gsa.gov, and Malcolm Lewis, Contract Specialist, at malcolm.lewis@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Exam Tables and Chairs for the VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).  Acquisition of these items is part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Chico VA Clinic in Chico, CA.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the Chico VA Clinic for below listed brand name or equal equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112.  The solicitation will be issued on or about October 9, 2018 for approximately ten (10) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety. In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND michelle.rhodes@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION)</strong>
<p><strong>FA8601-19-Q-0008SS.</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/ Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses that are capable of providing a Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction System (Digital PCR) as defined in the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) is seeking a Firm-Fixed Priced contract. Firms that respond shall specify that their devices meet the specifications provided below and in attachments and provide detailed information to show clear technical compliance. <strong>Please note that the Air Force is anticipating a Brand Name or Equal acquisition in accordance with FAR 52.211-6.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</strong></p>
<p>1.	Draft Statement of Work</p>
<p>The requirements in the draft statement of work will be used as technical discriminators. All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the requested supply to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. <strong>Please keep responses under two pages.</strong> As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Quotation) exists; therefore, do NOT request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is <strong>334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing) with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</strong> Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and also indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees, or foreign supplies on this effort. Capability responses will be assessed and the data will be used to assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy, including Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), sole source, or full and open, for any potential subsequent action.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001, market research results will be used to determine whether FAR Part 19 criteria are met for a SBSA or further socio-economic set aside.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SBSA is that small business prime contractors meet the requirements set forth in compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitation of Subcontract.  Responses from small businesses, therefore, need to include rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 will be achieved.  Also, the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size, as does the non-manufacturer rule. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the required supply. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements as stated in Attachment 1 hereto.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following email address: eric.filion@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "<strong>FA860119Q0008SS-Digital PCR</strong>". If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>Responses may also be mailed to:<br />AFLCMC/PZIBB, <br />ATTN: POC- Mr. Eric Filion<br />1940 Allbrook Dr., Rm 109<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSES ARE DUE NOT LATER THAN 9 October 2018 BY 1:00 PM Eastern Time.</strong> Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Eric Filion at eric.filion@us.af.mil.</p>

Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.<br /><br />Attention All potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.<br /><br />Part II. Capability Survey Questions:<br /><br />1. Name of country where the fire suppression system parts are manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.<br />3. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement. Include contract number and date, a brief description, agency/organization supported, and point of contact name and telephone number.<br />4.

Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public?

Describe your standard warranty and return process for goods and services furnished to the government for items similar in nature to this requirement.<br /><br />CAPABILITIES PACKAGE:<br /><br />All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to provide the requested items to the primary point of contact listed below.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />C-17 Crew Ladder</strong></p>
<p>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of a C-17 Crew Ladder for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the production data/repair data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to design and produce a new C-17 Crew Ladder. It is anticipated that any COTS ladder will have to be modified to meet the specific C-17 mission requirements. This will require a first article, first article test plan, and first article test report. The ladder will be replaced on all C-17s by attrition and then a requirement of 25 per a year will exist.</p>
<p><strong>Specific C-17 Crew Ladder Requirements</strong></p>
<p>1. Ladder shall be a Type 1A Collapsible Telescoping Step-Ladder design<br />2. Ladder must be OSHA 29 CFR 1910.23 Compliant<br />3. Ladder must be AFI 91-203 Compliant<br />4. Step-Ladder must telescope to a minimum height of 11'<br />5. Step Ladder shall have a folding platform assembly permanently attached to the top rungs to aid in transitioning across the top of the ladder.<br />6. Ladder shall have deployable hand rails that extend a minimum of 36" above the platform step.<br />7. Hand Rails shall be permanently attached to the ladder<br />8. Hand Rails shall retract and lock in the stowed flat position when the ladder is collapsed<br />9. In the extension ladder configuration, the ladder must collapse to a maximum length of 11'<br />10. The distance between the inner rails at the top of the extension ladder must be a minimum 16 3/8" apart to accommodate the C-17 T-Tail entry hatch support hooks. <br />11. The ladder shall have hinged, adjustable, rubber padded feet.<br />12. Ladder shall collapse to a maximum Storage Depth of 8".<br />13. Ladder shall not exceed 65 pounds weight.<br />14. Ladder must stow in C-17 Aircraft, in designated location without major modification to the aircraft.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, the ladder shall be void of any removable items such as clips, pins, plastic caps, wheels, etc. to preclude the possibility of Foreign Object Debris.<br /><br /><strong>Please view the attachments for the Contractor Capability Survey. Response deadline&nbsp;will be&nbsp;November 2, 2018 NLT 5:00pm EST.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>Argonne National Laboratory is seeking sources to provide office space that will accommodate 50 to 80 individuals. Criteria for the space include:</p>
<p>1. Location preferably within six to eight miles from Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Lemont, IL.<br />2. 15 to 20 private/semi-private offices.<br />3. 45 to 60 office cubicles.<br />4. Offices, cubicles, etc., wired for data services. <br />5. Adequate parking.</p>
<p>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Due to the value of government assets in the facility, a variety of security systems to include automated access controls, door alarms and interior intrusion/detection systems will be required as part of an integrated intrusion detection and assessment system. Argonne Security can work with respective facility representatives to develop appropriate solutions based on existing security infrastructure.</p>
<p><em>Video Monitoring</em></p>
<p>The tenant shall be allowed to modify the facility to install a minimum of 3 network-connected video surveillance cameras. This will involve the installation of a camera enclosure and cabling to deliver network and power to the installation location. Each camera shall be provided no less than 150Mbps in network bandwidth to provide live video to the Argonne campus. QoS provisions shall be provided such that video traffic is prioritized to allow real-time review.</p>
<p><em>Entry Doors</em></p>
<p>The main entry door shall be modified to allow the installation of card-based authentication of authorized personnel for entry. This may involve modification of the doorframe, door hardware, locks, exterior walls etc. in support of sensors, latches and releases. Installation of a cabinet, housing the authorization system, or cabling connecting the door control to the MDF may be required. Cabling shall be installed from the door control to the MDF for interconnection to the authorization system/server and connection to the tenant network.</p>
<p><em>Physical Security Sensors</em></p>
<p>The tenant shall be permitted to modify the facility to support the installation of security sensors, including but not limited to, magnetic switches on doors and windows, PIR (passive infrared), ultrasonic or microwave motion sensors, sound-based glass-break sensors, etc. These may be wired or wireless in nature. Installation of head-end nodes and support servers in MDF/IDF locations may also be required.</p>
<p><em>Existing Alarm Panel Use</em></p>
<p>If a security/alarm panel, and/or other security infrastructure is located within the facility, it shall be additionally connected to the tenant's network to provide monitoring access to Argonne's Security team. Given an agreement and documented MOU, such infrastructure may be jointly accessed by the facility and the tenant.</p>
<p><em>Facility Provided PA</em></p>
<p>The facility shall provide appropriate access to the internal/external PA system to announce emergencies and communicate with occupants of the facility. The system shall be accessible from within the facility to generate announcements and remotely by designated Argonne emergency personnel by either network or phone.</p>
<p><em>Customer Provided PA</em></p>
<p>If no PA system is available within the facility, the tenant shall be permitted to install equipment in the MDF to provide such service and to modify the facility to install speakers and establish cable infrastructure to connect speakers to the equipment in the MDF. The cable infrastructure may use existing wiring, or may be composed of newly installed cabling according to local code requirements. Speakers shall be installed to provide adequate coverage of announcements throughout the facility.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Force Protection Surveillance and Detection Enabling Technologies <br />Issued by the Product Manager (PdM) Force Protection Systems (FPS) on behalf of the Tactical Security System (TSS) Capability Development<br />1.0 SYNOPSIS<br />The Product Manager (PdM) Force Protection Systems (FPS) is seeking information from interested parties on readily available, commercial based surveillance, detection, and sensor network capabilities / solutions that have either been proven in field trials or by prototype testing in order to identify and evaluate innovative technologies and novel concepts that could potentially enhance US Army Force Protection (FP) abilities. These will be employed in either a stand-alone network configuration, or combined with other integrated based defense (IBD) and force FP systems supporting Base Camp (BC) and Theater Detention Facility (TDF) operations. The focus of this RFI is on mature surveillance and detection system elements and components capable of surveillance, detection and tracking of targets of interest such as walking humans, small vehicles, and large vehicles within a range of 1500 meters from an external perimeter security position and monitoring internal BC (battalion sized) or designated installation security areas as well as performing dedicated TDF operations. Primary interest is on complementary technologies and systems that can be used in an extendible networked configuration to provide the ability to detect, monitor, track threats, and increase standoff distances from hostile threats. This added capability will enhance a Commander's Force Protection (FP) Situational Awareness (SA), and improve response time and Soldier survivability. Major technologies and system component categories of interest covered in this RFI are imaging sensors, motion, and surface detection technologies, secure high-speed network (wired and wireless) interfaces and communications devices, full motion video surveillance and recording measures, open system and architected command and control (C2) applications, and sustainable, self-contained power supply and power management and distribution control capabilities. In addition, innovative concepts for system integration of promising surveillance and detection technologies and/or solutions are also under consideration. These system integrated capabilities must provide U.S. forces with the capability to operate and deploy FP technologies for extended periods of operation without added logistic and operational burden to the maximum extent possible. All technologies and capabilities presented should cite advantages and limitations, specifically addressing their employment in a stand-alone capacity or in a combined capabilities, and presenting how they may provide significant operational advantages within the context of BC and TDF operations. The information provided through this RFI is intended to provide insight on current and future technologies that the Government could possibly leverage for adaptation and utilization in a TSS program of record.
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. The Government would prefer that any submissions be non-proprietary in order to maximize potential use by the Government. Nonetheless, both proprietary and non-proprietary information will be accepted and the safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.<br />The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.<br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to engage with respondent(s) if additional information and/or clarification are deemed necessary.<br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the Government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The Government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the TSS program.<br />2.0 BACKGROUND<br />The current TSS CDD v1.5 identifies the following capability gaps: a critical need for a lightweight, ground-based surveillance and security system that includes pan/tilt/zoom controls and semi-autonomous monitoring; early warning; Brigade level and below units lack sufficient resources to perform decisive action operations while simultaneously performing its inherent responsibility for its own Base Security Operations during decisive action operations leading to degraded capability of its primary mission; Theater and below elements of the Army lack the ability to provide an enduring persistent surveillance capability for forward operating bases (FOB). The lack of enduring persistent surveillance leaves these locations vulnerable to threats; Corps and below forces lack the ability to provide an organic force responsible for the protection of critical installations and facilities security in support of the wide area security mission. The TSS will integrate current research efforts and COTS technologies with the latest IBD and Detention doctrine and training to support defense, security, and protection operations. Based on the DoD Critical Infrastructure (CI) Detect, Assess, Warn, Defend, and Recovery (DAWDR) functional framework, TSS will provide surveillance and detection to support integrated and shared understanding of the operational environment, it will directly support the Detect, Assess, and Warn functions; and enable and inform the capabilities and tasks associated with the Defend and Recovery functions. TSS core capabilities fit in the short to mid-range level of response to the following threat categories:<br />1) Surface and subterranean (SbT) threats.<br />2) Direct fire threats.<br />3) Non-specific threats - This also includes detection of threat personnel positioning themselves or equipment against friendly forces. In addition, this covers threat attempts at intrusion and surveillance capabilities.<br />The TSS Node is designed with the ability to be employed in either a stand-alone network configuration or integrated with other IBD and FP systems such as the Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) and the Integrated Ground Security and Surveillance Response Capability (IGSSR-C). The primary link between these systems is the Control Station (CS) (referenced as the Operator Station in the TSS Capability Document (CDD)). The CS used is dependent on the network configuration; a Portable CS (PCS) is used when operating on a closed restricted network, or a Fixed CS (FCS) is used when operating on an external network as part of the IBD. CS operation is managed by the IGSSR-C software. <br />The technologies should be capable of providing a rapidly deployable perimeter security and surveillance capability with day/night imaging functionality and accurate intrusion detection sensors to identify surface and subsurface intrusions/activities that indicate attempts to breach base perimeter or a detention facility (in or out). Additionally, secure network capabilities are core in establishing communication between emplaced edge-devices (i.e., sensors) and distribution of surveillance and ground-based security information to the TSS Operator responsible for executing C2 of the system. Lastly, power generation and source capabilities as well as the capability to handle regulation of available power (either external or internal) to the TSS Node is paramount in ensuring the system maintains the 24/7 operational cycle without disruption due to a power loss.<br />Specific technologies targeted for investigation and development are: : (1) systems working in the visible and infrared (near, mid wave and long wave) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to enable automatic detection and classification/identification of ground and surface targets given degraded atmospheric and environmental conditions; (2) a low-weight, man-portable, ground surveillance radar system (antenna and transceiver) to detect vehicular and individual movements targets with improved tracking accuracy/quality; (3) secure wireless transmission communication networks for wide-area sensor employment (i.e., sensor nodes) in order to receive C2 and forward sensor information to an operator control station; and (4) energy storage units (i.e., battery box) coupled with intelligent power management and control systems capable of supply source monitoring, synchronization, and load compensation based on system demand. At a minimum, identified technologies and capabilities shall be modular/expandable, using open interfaces, allowing sensors and componentry from other suppliers to be integrated into a scalable, modular surveillance and detection FP system.<br />3.0 PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather information and establish knowledge of current state of the art and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 4. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in information defined in paragraph 4 and the abilities to meet the parameters and measures listing in the attached Technical Attributes Table.<br />4.0 CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Currently TSS is in a pre-Milestone B acquisition phase with an approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD). Although some individual near-term sensor and infrastructure technologies associated with establishing surveillance and detection capability are considered mature, integration into a cohesive, interoperable FP system using self-contained power and secure network communications across worldwide deployed environments to meet demanding FP mission applications is challenging. Therefore, PdM FPS is canvassing industry to assist in identification of readily available commercial based solutions, innovative technologies, and novel concepts applicable to TSS that will expand system autonomous surveillance system functionality and enhance target detection and recognition performance at designated ranges. Additionally, stable, flexible, reliable and renewable, tactical power capabilities provide the life-line to TSS and supporting infrastructure to meet mission and duty-cycle demands for 24/7 operational coverage. Applying advanced network scalability features supports flexible edge-device employment and utilizing secure communication methods and modes ensures positive control of sensor data and system C2 is maintained whether in Line of Sight (LOS) and Non Line of Sight (NLOS) modes. The objective of the RFI is to solicit new thinking, focused on developing new technologies or employment of existing technologies in novel ways to address the operational challenges in providing BC and TDF protection. In support of the technology development, the Government plans to collaborate with industry in exploring technology advancements and alternatives to aid in accelerating maturation of system and subsystem capabilities in order to satisfy TSS design attributes and operational requirements delineated in the TSS CDD. <br />The goal of this collaborative strategy and the information collected through this RFI is to assess commercial investment to date and the maturity of enabling technologies/capabilities in support of TSS development. The following outlines the scope of information sought and maturity of commercial-based solutions as well as innovative technologies and TSS capability options to be presented by the vendor.<br />Technology Focus Areas:<br />All identified technologies shall have a near-term ability to demonstrate their operational effectiveness and suitability as it applies to surveillance and detection capabilities. In addition, the development and integration of capabilities in a stand-alone and/or modular, multi-system configuration is an area of interest in supporting TSS functionality. Submitted technology development efforts must take into consideration suitable commercially-available technological approaches and solutions for further maturation. The following technology focus areas are of interest to TSS system capability refinement and development. These are based on current analysis and preliminary technical readiness evaluation, with six (6) focus areas identified.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR ACQUISITION PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. ANY COST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL BE BORNE BY THE INTERESTED PARTY (PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR) AND WILL NOT BE CHARGED TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR REIMBURSEMENT.<br /><br />1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION:<br />1.1. No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of firms who have the technical level of expertise and demonstrable experience to perform the effort described below. The capability statements received will be used to determine the Bureau of Reclamation's overall procurement strategy.
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking sources with expertise and history in designing, manufacturing and installing fault protection for power plant switchgear in line with a Static Frequency Converter (SFC) or Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) which brings up large motors up to synchronous speed from a complete stop utilizing variable frequencies from 0hz to 60hz.</p>
<p>The facility this solution is sought for includes two large pump/generator units with the capability of starting in &lsquo;motor' mode when the unit is pumping water. These two units share an SFC, which is used by each unit when starting in &lsquo;motor' mode. After startup the unit is directly connected to the transmission system via a unit circuit breaker. This system is summarized in the attached Facility Sketch.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation is requesting the information to determine the quantity and level of experience of firms performing this type of work. The acquired information will be used to develop a RFP for protection of the SFC switch gear used for each of two motor-generators in pump mode.</p>
<p>2.0 SFC Switch Gear Fault Protection:</p>
<p>2.1. Description of Existing Issue: <br /><br />The existing SFC Output Switch-gear circuit breakers have underrated capability for the maximum available fault current contribution from the motor for a fault located in the SFC. The problems with the capability of the SFC Output Switchgear are listed below:</p>
<p>&bull;Circuit Breaker 326 has a rated close and latch capability of 58,000 amps and a fault current duty of 59,315 amps.</p>
<p>&bull;Circuit Breaker 326 has a rated interrupting capability of 23,400 symmetrical amps and a fault current duty of 42,697 symmetrical amps.</p>
<p>&bull;Circuit Breakers 122 and 222 have a rated interrupting capability of 36,400 symmetrical amps and a fault current duty of 42,697 symmetrical amps.</p>
<p>&bull;All three circuit breakers on the SFC Output Switch-gear are not rated to be able to interrupt a high current fault during low frequency conditions that would occur during startup of a unit in &lsquo;motor' mode when the SFC is ramping up the frequency of the unit</p>
<p>Facility Conditions</p>
<p>&bull;In general the SFC takes 193 seconds to start up a unit.</p>
<p>&bull;Motor current during startup is 613 A at 11.5kV.</p>
<p>In addition to the concerns summarized above it should be noted that many modern electrical protection relays are not capable of detecting faults in the frequency ranges that occur as the SFC is ramping up the frequency of the unit. The existing electrical protection relays located on the SFC Output Switchgear are older Westinghouse electro-mechanical relays. It is not know at this time that these relays would be capable of detecting a fault within this frequency range.</p>
<p>2.2. Protection Requirements:</p>
<p>2.2.1. A solution is sought to address the capability problems with the existing SFC Output Switchgear. This solution should protect the SFC from high current faults that would occur during the unit startup in motor mode, when the frequency is being ramped up. At this stage the frequency can be very low and well below the standard frequency range of a 60Hz rated circuit breaker.</p>
<p>Capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull;Interrupting capability of at least 63,000 symmetrical amps during low frequency operation.</p>
<p>&bull;Addresses the problems with the short circuit capability of the SFC Output Switch-gear. This does not require replacement of the SFC Output Switch-gear, a solution that prevented it from experiencing those fault currents would be acceptable as well.</p>
<p>&bull;If the solution relies on electrical protection relays to detect a fault it must address whether or not the protection relays will operate when the frequency is below the 10 or 15 Hz frequency tracking limitation of most microprocessor multifunction motor/generator protective relays available.</p>
<p>2.3. Attachments:</p>
<p>2.3.1. The following "FOR INFORMATION ONLY" drawings:<br /><br />USBR Drawing No. Title NA Facility Sketch</p>
<p><br />3.0 QUALIFICATIONS: <br /><br />Documentation shall be provided demonstrating history and furnishing customer references.</p>
<p>4.0 INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include the firm's full name, point of contact, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Firms are invited to demonstrate their capabilities by providing the following:</p>
<p>a)Statement of Capability (SOC) describing capability to provide the equipment and services described above and meet the experience requirements.</p>
<p>b)Describe salient characteristics and advantages of typical equipment that would be provided.<br /><br />c)Companies qualified to do business with the United States shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at SAM.gov/ and not be on the Excluded Parties List System (debarred list) at https://www.epls.gov.</p>
<p>Responses will be compiled and shared with the advisory committee and responses to the request will not be returned.</p>
<p>The subject line of the email shall be "Potential Sources Request for Information (RFI) for Static Frequency Converter Switch Gear Fault Protection". Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit a capability statement via email to gvotobraun@usbr.gov.</p>

<p><strong>PROJECT DETAILS: CO FLAP SUM 91(1) Fremont Pass Recreation Path</strong><br /> <br />The project is located in Summit County, Colorado, near the Copper Mountain Ski Resort. The project is roughly parallel to State Highway 91 between the Copper Mountain Far East Parking Lot (approx. Milepost 21.7) and the Climax Mine Water Treatment Plant access road (approx. Milepost 18.6).</p>
<p>The general scope of improvements is construction of approximately 3.3 miles of a new multi-use trail described as follows: <br />&bull;	Approx. 3.2 miles of 12' wide asphalt concrete pavement trail<br />&bull;	Approx. 460 feet of 12' wide timber boardwalk; <br />&bull;	Approx. 260 feet, 12' wide two-span prefabricated steel pedestrian bridge with simulated stone reinforced concrete abutments and pier.</p>
<p>Proposed new construction work includes linear grading, aggregate base, asphalt concrete pavement, drainage culvert installation, boardwalk, bridgework, pavement markings and signs.</p>
<p>The project is located on United State Forest Service lands within a Special Use Permit to Summit County Open Space and Trails and a portion within a CDOT Highway Easement Deed. The proposed trail alignment lies on top an existing utility corridor that contains natural gas, fiber optic, and electrical facilities that serve regional, statewide, and interstate customers. There are numerous wetlands adjacent to the proposed path, and the boardwalk will traverse a critical wetland restoration site. Environmental restrictions will be in effect. The contractor will need to exercise caution to ensure no unplanned disturbance to these critical facilities and resources. Access to and within the site is very limited, which will constrain the size and type of equipment capable of performing the work.</p>

<p>This partnership opportunity is in anticipation of a possible response to a NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO), 2018 Medium Explorer (MIDEX) element of the Heliophysics Explorers Program.  NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is developing a mission concept to be proposed for this AO.  The partnership opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner to provide the spacecraft, science-payload-to-spacecraft integration support, integration support for the spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft operations. NASA is expected to provide launch vehicle services for MIDEX missions under this AO.</p>
<p>This phase ends with a Step-1 proposal that will be due 3 months after the AO is released.  If the proposal is selected for implementation, the mission will proceed into Phase A, per NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR) 7120.5E (e.g. http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/main_lib.html).  If selected for a Phase A study, the partner is expected to assist NASA to further develop the design and develop the Step-2 Concept Study Report. Limited funds will be made available to the partner in Phase A through a Firm Fixed Price contract.  The following schedule should be used as a basis for responses to this opportunity:</p>
<p>Partnership Opportunity Document released		October 2, 2018 <br /> Notice of Interest					October 8, 2018<br />Responses due						October 16, 2018<br /> Partner Selection announced				October 23, 2018<br /> Helio MIDEX Draft AO Released			~late 2018 <br /> Helio MIDEX AO Released				~early 2019 <br /> Proposal submittal in response to MIDEX AO	~middle 2019 <br /> Phase A Selection(s) Announced			~late 2019 <br /> Concept Study Reports due 				~late 2020 <br /> Selection(s) Announced				~2021 <br />Launch Readiness date				~2025</p>
<p>The dates above are estimates based on current expectations for the AO release timeline and prior MIDEX mission proposal guidelines. More precise dates should be available in the Draft AO.</p>
<p>1.1	COST</p>
<p>The assumed cost cap for this AO is ~$200 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 dollars.  This cost includes the instrument, mission science, the spacecraft, management, safety &amp; mission assurance, integration &amp; testing, science-payload-to-spacecraft integration support, integration support for the spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft operations, as well as required contingency (25% or greater reserves on Phases A-D). This cost does not include launch services. Reserves will be held at the Project level, and not with the partner.</p>
<p>There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the Step-1 proposal to the MIDEX AO.  Funding will be available for subsequent phases (including Phase A) should the candidate mission concept be competitively selected for those additional phases. If selected, the spacecraft partner will continue to assist GSFC in Phase A with continuation of the concept design and Step-2 Concept Study Report (CSR).  Phase A funding provided by NASA will be allocated by GSFC amongst partners at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), and GSFC will fund and issue a Firm Fixed Price contract for the spacecraft partner's assistance in Phase A.  GSFC has the expectation that the spacecraft partner will also contribute bidding and proposal funds for their effort in Phase A.</p>
<p>1.2	DESIRED MISSION SERVICES</p>
<p>GSFC is interested in formally establishing a partner to provide the following services for this mission: hosting of the science payload on a Sun-pointed low-Earth-orbiting spacecraft, systems design, science-payload-to-spacecraft integration support, spacecraft-to-launch-vehicle integration support, and spacecraft operations.  The partner can be additionally responsible for instrument systems integration and testing and/or the Mission Operations Center, although neither is required.  If included, the cost should be identified as options. The science instruments will be provided by GSFC for accommodation.</p>
<p>All interested parties are required to respond to this POD in accordance with Section 4 below.</p>
<p>1.3	PROPOSAL SUPPORT</p>
<p>It is expected that the selected POD respondent will provide support using their own resources to help develop the required MIDEX proposal elements in response to the MIDEX AO in the areas of a well-defined and documented spacecraft, instrument accommodations, systems design, (optional) instrument systems integration and testing, instrument to spacecraft integration support, integration support for the spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft operations.  The partner will be expected to write or assist in the writing of portions of the Step-1 proposal relevant to their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the partner will meet with the Principal Investigator (PI) and other proposal team members to help define the end-to-end performance requirements, including providing well-defined interfaces to the spacecraft in the form of draft Interface Control Documents (ICDs), to define the system architecture, to identify study topics, and to predict flight performance.  This will include cost estimation for mission phases.  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 6 months, starting in ~October 2018.</p>
<p>If the mission is selected for development and launch (Phases B-F), the partner will be responsible for the design and development of the spacecraft, instrument accommodations and integration support, integration support for the spacecraft to launch vehicle, spacecraft operations, and (optional) instrument systems integration and testing.  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 5 years (~3 years development and ~2 years operation), starting in 2021.  These dates and times are subject to change depending on selection timelines and budget allocations or phasing.</p>
<p><br />2.0	LAUNCH VEHICLE</p>
<p>2.1	LAUNCH VEHICLE</p>
<p>NASA will provide launch vehicle (LV) services for this MIDEX AO. The offered services are expected to be the same as those detailed for the 2016 Astrophysics MIDEX AO (see https://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APMIDEX2016/MIDEX/pdf_files/MIDEX_2016ELVSummaryInfo_RevC_2-7-18.pdf).</p>
<p>2.2	LAUNCH READINESS DATE</p>
<p>The vendor must commit to meeting the launch readiness date expected in the MIDEX AO of 2025. However, a shorter development time and earlier launch date is acceptable and encouraged.</p>
<p>3.0	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This concept will be managed by the GSFC in partnership with the chosen partner who will host the instrument on a spacecraft which uses high-heritage subsystems and proven, well-tested engineering design. Proven launch-to-space heritage must be demonstrated in the submission in response to this POD.  Mechanical, electrical, and thermal interfaces must be well defined by providing the GSFC team with draft ICDs - post partnership selection - that the GSFC team can use to show maturity of the MIDEX design and design interfaces to the spacecraft.  This mission is expected to be classified as a Category 2 mission (per NPR 7120.5E) with a Class C payload (per NPR 8705.4) (see http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/main_lib.html).</p>
<p>3.1	MISSION</p>
<p>3.1.1	General</p>
<p>The Sun-pointed payload shall be accommodated on a spacecraft placed into an Earth orbit of approximately 600 km altitude. The orbit should minimize radiation exposure. The preferred orbit will have an inclination of less than 35&deg;, though higher-inclination orbits may be considered to facilitate data downlink. The spacecraft must be of an End-of-Mission demisable design with re-entry less than 25 years after the end of the mission, or 30 years after launch, whichever is earlier. The fully integrated observatory should fit within the anticipated payload fairing (see Section 2.1).</p>
<p>The location and methodology for (optional) Payload-level Integration &amp; Test (Payload I&amp;T), Observatory-level Integration &amp; Test (Observatory I&amp;T), support for mission operations, and transmission of instrument data to GSFC shall be described in the response. A Mission Operations Center element may be included in the response but is not required. Options should be identified and broken-out from the total cost.</p>
<p>The payload consists of multiple instruments, all of which observe the Sun and whose pointings must be co-aligned. One of the instruments has an instrument component that must be deployed at the end of an extendable boom. The boom is not considered part of the spacecraft, but rather part of the instrument package. The boom is deployed once on-orbit, after spacecraft initialization.<br /> <br />Figure 1: Observatory configuration after boom deployment. The spacecraft bus is presumed to contain both Element 1 of Instrument Package 1 and the entirety of Instrument Package 2, though other configurations can be considered.</p>
<p>3.1.2	Lifetime</p>
<p>The mission has a minimum 24 month on-orbit operating time, with the possibility of an extended mission of at least 24 months.</p>
<p>3.1.3	Volume</p>
<p>The observatory volume must fit within the anticipated payload fairing (see Section 2.1). At launch the total instrument volume is approximately 3.75 m3.  After launch, the payload boom will expand in length to ~14 m; the boom length will not vary once set. Approximate volume of the instrument components at the deployed end of the boom is 1.25 m3.</p>
<p>3.1.4	Mass</p>
<p>The instrument has a maximum expected mass of ~250 kg. The total instrument mass is distributed so that ~75% of the mass is located at element 1 and ~20% is located at element 2. The boom structure and associated harness accounts for the remaining mass.</p>
<p>3.1.5	Power</p>
<p>The spacecraft shall provide peak power of NTE 400 W when the instruments are observing.  The power usage for the instrument will be less than 200 W when not observing the Sun, including heater power. The spacecraft shall provide DC power between 24-32 V throughout the mission.</p>
<p>3.1.6	Thermal</p>
<p>Thermal control for the instruments will be a passive system with multi-layer insulation (MLI), radiators, and heaters.  Since the Observatory is nominally Sun-pointed, radiation surfaces can placed in locations with minimal to zero exposure to sunlight.</p>
<p>3.1.7	Data</p>
<p>The spacecraft shall provide a data interface to the payload capable of both sending commands to the payload and receiving data from the payload.  The preferred data interface between the spacecraft and the payload has not been defined.  Interfaces that can be supported by the spacecraft shall be described in the response to this POD.</p>
<p>The primary storage for science data is within the science payload, and data is sent to the spacecraft as needed to support downlinks by the spacecraft.  The payload's nominal data rate is ~200 Gigabytes per day, and the peak rate is ~400 Gigabytes per day.  Full data recovery is assumed, but more selective downlink strategies are being considered. The data-handling interface must support the transport and temporary storage of data for downlink.  A NASA Near-Earth Network (NEN) compatible Ka-band data downlink subsystem is assumed, but other solutions can be proposed.  There is no stringent requirement on data latency.<br /> <br />3.1.8	Attitude Control</p>
<p>The spacecraft must support pointing the Observatory at the Sun with a selectable pitch and yaw offset from the center of the Sun (up to ~1 degree for operations and up to ~7 degrees for calibration) and a selectable roll orientation.  Observatory-level pitch/yaw pointing control must be to ~1 arcminute and pointing knowledge  to &lt;1 arcsecond.  The Observatory-pointing knowledge is provided by the science payload.  Observatory-level roll control and knowledge must be to ~100 arcsec.  The spacecraft shall satisfy appropriate sub-allocations so that the Observatory-level control requirements are satisfied.  Instrument Package 2 is sensitive to spacecraft jitter at frequencies &gt;0.1 Hz, so responses should describe approaches to minimize platform jitter.</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments for the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Canandaigua, NY area. The project consists of the construction of a 120 bed Community Living Center (CLC) complex, a Community Center, and Loading Dock; renovation of Building 9 for Domiciliary; renovation of Buildings 3, 4, and 5 to support outpatient functions; and demolition of Buildings 33 and 34. The project is located at the Canandaigua VA Medical Center located in Canandaigua, New York. This project will also include infrastructure enhancements and site development work, such as utilities, parking and landscaping. The project will be constructed in accordance with all federal, state, and local codes, EM 385-1-1, OSHA, and other applicable codes and regulations. Detailed Construction Scheduling, Infection Prevention Measures, Quality Assurance Testing, Operation and Maintenance Manuals, Enhanced Commissioning, Contractor and Government Field Office, and As-Built drawings will be required. The above-ground/underground utility systems service multiple campus buildings (including a medical clinic) that must remain operational during demolition/construction. The utility tie-ins to the existing utility systems must be accomplished during coordinated outages. The contract duration is anticipated at 1,752 calendar days.
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.

<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island District, is seeking businesses that are capable of providing the following: Keithsburg Division Habitat Rehabilitation and Enhancement Project Stage I and Stage II Project. The Project is located in Pool 18 along the left descending bank of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), immediately north of the City of Keithsburg in Mercer County, Illinois, between river miles 428.0 and 431.0. The Project is bordered by the Edwards River to the north, Pope Creek to the south, and the Mississippi River to the west. It is separated from the Mississippi River by a 3-mile-long berm. The Project area is a 1,400-acre backwater complex of interconnected backwaters, wetlands, and floodplain habitat that is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as part of the Port Louisa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The Project is funded by the Upper Mississippi River Restoration program.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Project is to restore and protect off-channel aquatic, wetland, and floodplain forest habitats. <br />&bull; All work will be within or adjacent to the river, subject to water fluctuations. Limited land access may be available across an unimproved berm. Work may require river access. Some work will be in the water. <br />&bull; One to two spillways (~2,000 total linear feet) will require construction along a berm located adjacent to the Mississippi River. Work will include tree clearing, excavation, and placement of drainage stone, geotextile fabric, riprap, and articulated concrete mats. Some concrete work may be required.<br />&bull; A new berm (~2,200 linear feet) will be constructed across the southern portion of the Project in inundated conditions. The berm will be constructed of pervious material, with an impervious cap. Electrical conduit will be placed within the berm. Road stone may be placed on top of the berm for an access road.<br />&bull; An existing berm (~18,300 linear feet) will require impervious material to bring the side slopes to design grade, and in some areas, impervious material will be placed within the top several feet of the berm. Work will require clearing prior to construction and seeding following construction of the enhanced berms (~40 acres).<br />&bull; Demolition of an existing concrete spillway, riprap spillway, pump pad, and gated structure will be required. <br />&bull; The construction of this Project is anticipated to take four years.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection Quarantine (PPQ) MFRF located in Edinburg, TX intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to BioLog, Inc. for&nbsp; GEN III ID System. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106(b)(1)(i). The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).<br />The property or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of property or services will satisfy these needs.
<p>Description of the Item Required: GEN III OmniLog ID System:</p>
<p>Biolog's powerful carbon source utilization technology accurately identifies environmental and pathogenic microorganisms by producing a characteristic pattern or "metabolic fingerprint" from discrete test reactions performed within a 96 well microplate. Culture suspensions are tested with a panel of pre-selected assays, then incubated, read and compared to extensive databases of environmental organisms, human pathogens, veterinary pathogens and plant pathogens. The scope of the 96 assay reactions, coupled with sophisticated interpretation software, delivers a high level of accuracy that is comparable to molecular methods. The one minute per sample set up is much simpler and faster than DNA sequencing and the automated pattern matching eliminates the need for training and expertise in gene sequence interpretation. The rapid identification of potentially pathogenic bacteria will allow us to keep the fruit fly colony clean, while also protecting the staff that work with them on a daily basis. With this technology staff will be able to identify problem bacteria and rapidly implement sanitation protocols to address the contamination.</p>
<p>The current order is for:<br />1 each GEN III OmniLog ID System 115 VAC Part Number: 91371<br />1 each GEN III Database (GN &amp; GP) Part Number: 22730D</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, to the Contracting Officer by 10:00 am Mountain Time (MT) by October 17, 2018. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p>Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Jeanine Goral, Contracting Specialist <br />USDA APHIS MRPBS AAMD Procurement Branch 2150 Centre Avenue Building B MS (2E21), Fort Collins, CO 80526, or via email @ Jeanine.J.Goral@aphis.usda.gov. or fax to 970-472-1897 (2E6)</p>

NASA's Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>
<div><strong>The Technology:&nbsp;</strong>
<p><br />NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has developed a layered composite insulation system for nonvacuum applications and extreme environmental exposure conditions. This layered composite insulation system for extreme conditions (or LCX) is particularly suited for complex piping or tank systems that are difficult or practically impossible to insulate by conventional means. Consisting of several functional layers, the aerogel blanket-based system can be tailored to specific thermal and mechanical performance requirements. Mechanically, the LCX system not only withstands impact, vibration, and the stresses of thermal expansion and contraction, but can help support pipes and other structures, all while maintaining its thermal insulation effectiveness. NASA KSC is currently seeking companies interested in licensing LCX for commercial applications.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please submit a license application through NASA's Automated Technology Licensing Application System (ATLAS) by visiting <strong>https://technology.nasa.gov/apply/license/KSC-TOPS-58</strong></p>

<div><strong><br /></strong>
<p><strong>The Technology:</strong></p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks partners interested in the further development and commercial application of High-Performance Polyimide Powder Coatings for longer-lasting, improved corrosion control. Through their earlier work with polyimide materials, KSC scientists identified polyimides with much lower melting points than traditional polyimides that were used for insulation. The lower melting points, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and electrical properties of these new polyimides led KSC researchers to develop new polyimide powder coatings that could be used to prevent corrosion. The results of preliminary tests of the coatings and their resistance to salt spray corrosion are very encouraging, and commercial partners are sought for further development.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Satellite and Information Acquisition Division (SIAD) located at 1325 East-West Highway Silver Spring Metro Center Building 2 (SSMC2) Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, intends to award an out-of-scope modification to contract #AB-133E-16-CN-0132 on a sole source basis in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The proposed source is McMurdo, Inc. located at 4296 Forbes Blvd. Lanham, MD 20706.  The requirement is to provide site preparation for a dedicated 2.4m Argos X/L-band antenna at the Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (CDAS) in Fairbanks, Alaska by September 30, 2018.  This will allow the Argos Data Collection System (DCS) and Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO), Satellite Products and Services Division (SPSD), Direct Services Branch (DSB)  within the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to accomplish its mission of supporting the global Argos DCS ground segment in advance of "Argos-4" launches by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in early 2019, NOAA in late 2021, and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in 2022.  McMurdo is already contracted to perform similar site preparation work in support of the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) Program at the Fairbanks CDAS.  Contracting site preparation work of the Argos platform concurrently with the SARSAT work to McMurdo would save the government 8 months in establishing the platform.  If the Argos platform does not get installed by the end of September 2018 it will be delayed until June, as pouring concrete and performing trenching and underground cabling work will not be feasible due to the freezing weather.  This modification is necessary to avoid a break in service for this critical mission requirement for both the Argos DCS and the SARSAT program.  There are currently no high latitude stations that can support L-band downlink which will be the only downlink available from the Argos-4 instrument scheduled to launch in early 2019 on OceanSat-3.  High latitude platforms provide more over passes due to the polar orbit of these satellites.  This platform would significantly reduce data latency.  A full and open competition to complete the work would cause intolerable delay to the Direct Services Branch and pose an operational risk to the Government.  The Government anticipates modifying the contract to add a Firm Fixed Price CLIN with a period of performance ending on September 30, 2018.
<p>This notice is published for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive quotations. However, any firm who believes they can meet this requirement may submit a response in writing. Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating the company's ability to meet the above requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses must be received no later than 15 calendar days after publication of this synopsis to the person listed as the Government point of contact in this announcement.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of the Government Contract Specialist. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation.</p>

<DESC>This notice serves as a notice of intent. The statutory authority permitting sole sourcing for this acquisition is 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Directorate of Contracting intends to insert a brand name specification, for SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system, into a design-bid-build, firm fixed price (FFP) contract for the Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) located in Canandaigua, NY. This phase of the project will consist of construction of a 120 bed Community Living Center (CLC) complex and a Community Center; renovation of Building 9 for Domiciliary; renovation of Buildings 3, 4, and 5 to support outpatient functions; and demolition of Buildings 33 and 34. This project will also include infrastructure enhancements and site development work, such as utilities, parking and landscaping.
<p><br />The design calls for the installation of a SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system similar to the existing SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system used throughout the VAMC Canandaigua campus currently. The integration of a newly installed SimplexGrinnell fire alarm system into the existing campus wide fire alarm system is critical to maintaining the overall integrity of the medical center's fire alarm system, and the ability to provide safe and functional performance during a fire or other life safety event at VAMC Canandaigua. It is therefore the Government's position that the new fire alarm system for the VAMC Canandaigua project must seamlessly interface with the existing fire alarm system used throughout the campus, and that the SimplexGrinnell system is proprietary and any attempt to interface with other systems, if possible, is cost prohibitive, the SimplexGrinnell system is the only feasible alternative for the VAMC Canandaigua project.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 17 October 2018. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Brenna.a.crawford@usace.army.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

This RPI contains background material and guidance for preparing Project Information Paper submissions to MTEC.<br />&nbsp;
<p>As a result of MTEC member feedback at the MTEC Annual Membership Meeting in April 2018, MTEC has issued this "Open Concepts RPI" to provide existing and potential MTEC members with an opportunity to demonstrate current capabilities and concept/technologies that may address military medical capability gaps. Performers are encouraged to submit concepts/technologies under this RPI that they would like the Government to consider when developing the technical research topics to be included in upcoming Requests for Project Proposals (RPPs) expected to be released in fiscal year 2019. The Government is interested in receiving project ideas related the following technology focus areas. Please see the full RPI located at <a href="https://mtec-sc.org/active-solicitations/">https://mtec-sc.org/active-solicitations/</a> for complete details.</p>

Project Information Papers submitted after the due date will not be accepted under any circumstances. There is no limit on the number of Project Information Papers that a single organization can submit. Submission in response to this RPI is open to both members and non-members of MTEC.

<p><br /><strong>MTEC RPI Submission Review:<br /></strong><br />1. MTEC intends to provide an initial review of all Project Information Papers submitted in response to this RPI to evaluate their objectives, relevance, and maturity as they relate to military needs. However, if the number of submissions becomes too large to make timely responses, MTEC may close the solicitation period early and without warning. Therefore, early submissions are highly encouraged. MTEC will provide the initial review on a rolling basis, so feedback should be provided within a relatively short period after submission and will afford the submitter a chance to update the Project Information Paper prior to referral to the Government. During the course of this review, MTEC may ask the submitter clarifying questions or provide suggestions that could improve the submission. MTEC intends to provide a short paragraph back to the submitter that describes why the Project Information Paper may or may not be a strong response for the relevant Government Sponsor to consider.<br /><br />2. Submitters who receive feedback from MTEC will be given an opportunity to update their Project Information Papers based on the feedback provided. The submitter will be given additional time to update the Project Information Paper based on the feedback. The cover page of the feedback letter will provide a due date for the revised Project Information Paper.<br /><br />3. MTEC will then forward all RPI submissions to the Government for consideration as suggested topics to be solicited under a future RPP(s).</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

Offerors will be required to load in 5,000 USG ISO-containers and transport via truck to European destinations and cargo vessel/truck to Middle Eastern destinations. For Continental (US) CONUS locations, the delivery method used is tank truck. The specific details will be included within the schedule of the solicitation by product and location. The total estimated quantity is as follows:</p>
<p>FSII - 3,887,000 USG <br />NSN: 6850-01-057-6427<br />MIL-DTL-85470B dated 1 June 1999</p>
<p>CLA - 12,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-628-6264<br />MIL-PRF-25017H (1) dated 2 October 2016</p>
<p>LIA - 80,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-604-2853<br />MIL-PRF-32490 dated 25 February 2014</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1. The CLA additive is a fuel-soluble corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver additive for use in aviation turbine fuel, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and related petroleum products. It is defined by MIL-PRF-25017. Awards will be made only for products that are, at the time of award of contract, qualified and included in the Qualified Products List (QPL) No. 25017 which can be found at http://qpldocs.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>2. The LIA additive is one of two grades of diesel lubricity improver additives that are used in naval distillate fuels conforming to MIL-DTL-16884. It is defined by MIL-PRF-32490. All LIA products offered must be listed on the Qualified Products List (QPL) to be considered for award (link: http://qpldocs.dla.mil/). LIA products not on the QPL list will need to be vetted and approved. Please contact Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: SEA 05S, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE, Stop 5160, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5160 or emailed to CommandStandards@navy.mil for vetting process.</p>
<p>3. All offers of products FSII, CLA, LIA, must indicate the product name and product manufacturer in the offer being submitted. All offers with products indicated that are not manufactured by the offeror must include a Supply Commitment Letter with the offer to indicate/verify the offeror's ability to provide products of the type and quantity indicated within its offer. See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of what must be included in the Supply Commitment Letter.</p>
<p>4. Colonial Pipeline, VA: In addition to the requirements for CLA appearing in Quality Assurance Provision (QAP) C30-2, CLA supplied to this location are required to meet one of the low temperature viscosity requirements specified below. This additional requirement for CLA is due to infrastructure capability restrictions at this location. This performance requirement must be met in order to ensure pumpability of the product at this location.</p>
<p>a) Dynamic viscosity 450 centipoise (cP) maximum at 0 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 2983, or</p>
<p>b) Kinematic viscosity 350 centistokes (cSt) maximum at 30 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 445.</p>
<p>5. United Arab Emirates Embargo of Qatar:</p>
<p>Due to the current Qatar embargo issued by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued a Notice to Mariner(s) stating that UAE ports will not allow ships to load any cargo from UAE destined for Qatar. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFIC) has declined to issue written assurance that the Notice to Mariner(s) is not applicable to U.S. DOD cargo destined for Qatar. Therefore, all FSII bid line proposals with shipping points or utilizing supply points in UAE will NOT be evaluated to Qatar.</p>
<p>Offerors submitting FSII bid lines with shipping points or utilizing supply points located in nations who are participating in the Qatar Embargo (other than UAE) or are otherwise imposing additional restrictions on shipping product to Qatar must provide documentation from cognizant port authority or management verifying the ability to provide product for delivery to Qatar. If sufficient documentation is not submitted, the bid lines will not be evaluated to Qatar. As of the date of this synopsis, the following countries, in addition to the UAE, have publically cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and/or are participating in the embargo: Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Maldives, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Yemen. Please note that this list is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and offerors are responsible for notifying DLA Energy whether the nations in which their shipping points or supply points are located are participating in the embargo or have some other similar restriction on shipping product to Qatar.</p>
<p>6. Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) Requirement:<br />&nbsp;<br />Vendors and subcontractors must be registered in the Joint Contingency Contracting System (JCCS) to be considered for contract awards in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Operation (AOR). CENTCOM-affected offers include the following:<br /><br />a) Offeror physical address is located in CENTCOM<br />b) Offeror is submitting FOB Destination Offer(s) to CENTCOM<br />c) Offeror is submitting shipping point(s) located in CENTCOM<br /><br />U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) includes the following countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.<br />Each offeror must submit its registration number with its offer package. If awarded, active registration must be maintained throughout contract performance. Instructions for account registration and training can be found at www.jccs.gov. Please go to www.jccs.gov, http://www.jccs.gov/ then click on "vendor login", click the registration tab, and follow the directions from there.</p>

Prime Contractors and subcontractors at any tier may verify their registration at https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/ by selecting the "Vendors Login" module and logging in with their user name and password. The offeror must be registered, approved, and eligible for installation access prior to award, and remain eligible for installation access for the life of the contract.<br /><br />The offeror is required to submit a listing of all proposed subcontractors, at all tiers, to the contracting officer with the submission of the proposal, and provide updates during the life of the contract when subcontractors are added or removed. If no subcontractors are expected to perform during the life of the contract, the offeror must submit a negative response to the Contracting Officer with its proposal. After award, the prime contractor must submit a negative response to the contracting officer at the beginning of each performance period.</p>
<p>7. The Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904:</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to adhere to the Military Cargo Preference Act of 1904 which requires that all supplies bought for the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps must be carried solely (100%) on U.S.-flag vessels except in certain circumstances. In addition, Contractors must give the government plenty of notice before a foreign-flag vessel can be waived into service. Specifically, DFARS 252.247-7023 states that the contractor must submit any request for use of other than U.S.-flag vessels in writing to the contracting officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date necessary to meet its delivery schedules.</p>
<p>8. No Small Business set-asides will be offered for this procurement.</p>
<p>9. The Government reserves the right to make awards based on initial offered prices. Based on this, offerors should ensure all offered prices submitted with their initial offer are its best competitive and final price(s).</p>
<p>10. Proposals submitted electronically through a single e-mail must be no more than10 MB in size. DLA Energy's mail server will reject messages larger than 10 MB.</p>
<p>11. There is an expectation that the solicitation will be posted in October 2018.</p>
<p>12. Please be reminded, that all offers must be submitted on the Offeror Submission Package (OSP).

<p>52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items. (DEVIATION 2018-O0018)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Aug 2018)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions, including alternative line items (provided that the alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation), or alternative commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.</p>

<p>(End of Provision)<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.</p>
<p>As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">_Page 10 and 11 of the PWS outline the service's summary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please provide information as to how your company will successfully perform the tasks required._</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Contracting Officer shall insert the significant evaluation factors, such as</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p>(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We will evaluate on a Go-No-Go basis for technical acceptability and then technically acceptable offers will be reviewed for price and lowest price technically acceptable will be offered award.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractors EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract.

If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractors financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System.

(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

                    (i)  Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.
 
                    (ii)  Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.<BR><BR>(2)  For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:
 
                    (i)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.
 
                    (ii)(A)  The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800-171, as soon as practical, but not later than December 31, 2017. For all contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, within 30 days of contract award, of any security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-171 not implemented at the time of contract award.

The Contractor need not implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or to have an alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place.
 
                            (C)  If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractors requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract.
 
                            (D)  If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.<BR><BR>(3)  Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.
 
      (c)  Cyber incident reporting requirement.
 
            (1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractors ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall
 
                    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractors network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractors ability to provide operationally critical support; and
 
                    (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (2)  Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
 
            (3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.
 
      (d)  Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(e)  Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
 
      (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.
 
      (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
 
      (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<BR><BR>i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD
 
            (1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;
 
            (2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;
 
            (3)  To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;
 
            (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
 
            (5)  To a support services contractor (recipient) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
 
      (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Governments use and release of such information.
 
      (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<BR><BR>(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractors responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
 
      (m)  Subcontracts. The Contractor shall
 
            (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and
 
            (2)  Require subcontractors to
 
                    (i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and
 
                    (ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.<BR><BR>(a)Definitions. As used in this clause -

Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.

<DESC>&nbsp;Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Architect and Engineering (AE) Services to Support the Planning, Engineering, and Construction Phase Services, Galveston District, Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.<br /><br /><br />ALL QUESTIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE BIDDER INQUIRY PORTAL IN PROJNET AS DESCRIBED IN THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS BELOW.<br />Point Of Contact for this announcement is Mr. Aldrich Nichols. This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.<br />&nbsp; <br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required to provide planning, design, and engineering during construction/construction phase services primarily in support of the Civil Works mission area. Similarly related horizontal engineering projects may be required to support the Military and Interagency and International Support (IIS) missions. The contractor will be required to perform services primarily within the USACE Galveston District but up to the Southwestern Division area of responsibility.
<p>This announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E services with a total shared capacity of $96M and includes a target of three (3) Unrestricted A-E IDCs, a target of three (3) reserve Small Business IDCs, and a target of three (3) reserve Woman-Owned Small Business A-E IDCs. The Government may award more or less than three (3) firms within each business class depending on the source selection decision regarding how many contractors are considered most highly qualified in accordance with Brooks Act procedures.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting. Firms should state the words UNRESTRICTED, SMALL BUSINESS, or WOMAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS after the solicitation number in PART I, A Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate proposal MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. Only firms considered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Multiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a term not to exceed a total of seven (7) years, which includes a five (5) year base period and two (2) year option. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed $96,000,000 over the seven-year life of the contracts.</p>
<p>Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. The small business size standard is a maximum of $15 million of average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years. All interested Other than Small Business A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. Large businesses selected for this contract must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large businesses selected for this contract will be required to submit these plans during contract negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330.</p>
<p>Selection for Task Order Negotiation after Award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $2,500, applicable to the base period only. The maximum task order amount for the Unrestricted would be $6,000,000, for the Small Business reserve would be $750,000, and for the Woman Owned Small Business reserve would be $125,000 unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer based upon a review of the task order scope and confirmation that a firm is considered most highly qualified based upon a review of their SF 330. All requirements with an estimated value at or below these maximum amounts will be reserved for that business class first. Should review of the qualifications of the Woman Owned Small Business firms find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, per the limitation to small business subcontracting, the government will then proceed to the Small Business reserve. Should review of the qualifications of the Small Business firms find they are not highly qualified to perform the requirement or do not contain the appropriate in-house resources to self-perform the required minimum amount of work, the government will then proceed to the Unrestricted class. The government will not consider a requirement above the $750,000 threshold to be automatically directed to the Unrestricted class, as both the Woman Owned Small Business and Small Business reserves will be considered first for each requirement irrespective of its estimated value. After task order requirements are defined, Galveston District will determine if the SF 330s submitted in response to this synopsis provide the information needed to provide a basis to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements, or if additional, task order-specific information is needed to determine the most highly qualified contractor to perform the task order requirements.<br /><br />Contractor Manpower Reporting: For any task orders associated with military funding types, the contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the Department of Defense via a secure data collection site. The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/. Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 01 through September 30. While inputs may be reported at any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year, beginning with 2019. Contractors may direct questions to the help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>

<DESC><div><strong>A. Background:</strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The General Services Administration (GSA) Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) is a non- Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based solicitation authority for acquiring innovative and commercial solutions. Section 880 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114-328) authorized GSA to implement a pilot program to competitively procure innovative commercial items, technologies, and services using CSO procedures. CSO is new acquisition mechanism that provides a streamlined acquisition process and simplified contract terms that is designed to attract start-up companies and others who have not previously worked with U.S. Government.</div>
<div>The GSA FEDSIM innovation team is utilizing the CSO and seeking proposals for innovative, commercial items, technologies and services currently in the production/commercialization phase as well as adaptations of existing commercial products. GSA FEDSIM will post solicitations for a specific project or technical area of interest when an opportunity is open.</div>

<div>Includes existing items within the production/commercialization phase (i.e. after design or development, and before widespread government adoption) as well as adaptations of existing commercial products.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The CSO solicitation process will include a multi-phased solicitation and evaluation approach: Phase 1 &ndash; Submission of the Written Solution Brief, Phase 2 &ndash; Oral Presentation (if applicable), and Phase 3- Request for Proposal. The CSO is considered a competitive process, intended to ensure that competitive procedures are used to the maximum extent practicable.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Interested parties are highly encouraged to visit the GSA FEDSIM website https://fedsim.gsa.gov/CSOsolutions.html and register (sign up) for RSS feed (when available), to obtain more information regarding the CSO process and new opportunities.

<div>Potential offerors are hereby advised of the following:</div>
<div>Solicitation for solution briefs is not a guarantee that award and obligation of funds will be made.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The costs incurred by companies in the preparation and submission of their solution briefs in response to solicitations will not be paid by the government and are not allowable as a direct charge to any government contract.</div>

</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) intends to award a fixed price IDIQ contract for spare parts for portable, microprocessor-based Eddy Current Testing (ET) Systems on a sole source basis with Olympus America Inc., Waltham, MA.&nbsp; The Government does not own the technical data package to compete the requirement for new production units in order to resolve parts obsolescence issues and mitigate impact to mission readiness.</p>
<p>Olympus America is the OEM of the currently fielded Eddy Current Flaw Detector, Nortec 2000D+.&nbsp; This unit will not be supported beyond 2020.&nbsp; The replacement model number of the Nortec 2000D+ is the Nortec 600D.&nbsp; The Nortec 600D is capable of being a drop in functional replacement for the Nortec 2000D+.&nbsp; In addition to the obsolescence issues, we are currently operating at a Fleet deficit which is impacting mission readiness.&nbsp; The Nortec 600D has already been evaluated and approved for Fleet usage by cognizant NDI FSTs.&nbsp; In addition to the FST evaluations already having been completed, the usage, setup parameters and screens can be made to mirror the Navy's current unit.&nbsp; This will enable current inspection procedures for each aircraft platform to be utilized without having to research, re-write and update all of the aircraft platform manuals. This will allow for "speed to the Fleet" and mitigate risk to operational readiness due to the estimated three year period required for research and update for each aircraft platform.&nbsp; Furthermore the sole source will avoid drastic cost with additional impact to schedule.</p>
<p>Olympus America is the original designer, developer and manufacturer of the Nortec product line and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical expertise to produce an operational drop- in replacement unit.</p>
<p>NAWCADLKE intends to award this contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; No solicitation will be available for this procurement.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The following questions and answers have been submitted to industry.  More questions have been received and will be published if they are valid and when answers are received.  

At this time, the USG does not plan on changing set-aside status.  Please see the final solicitation for any updates at that time. 

1) 3.2.2 (b) talks about having correct angles/dimensions for mounting of the actual COTS MSO Displays (x4), are these displays being provided NAVAIR?

-No.  Para 1.1 it states, The contractor will propose a design herein defined and, once approved by the Government, shall fabricate and finish parts, procure related COTS equipment, assemble, integrate and deliver the physical components of the Minotaur Crewman Simulator Student Station to NAWCTSD as a prototype.
Paras  3.2.3, 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 state Material requirements and call out specific part numbers and specifications.

2) 3.2.2 (h) talks about having correct crew station dimensions for mounting of the Keyboard, Trackball, and the UHCU, are these items being provided by NAVAIR?

-No.  Para 1.1 it states, The contractor will propose a design herein defined and, once approved by the Government, shall fabricate and finish parts, procure related COTS equipment, assemble, integrate and deliver the physical components of the Minotaur Crewman Simulator Student Station to NAWCTSD as a prototype. Paras  3.2.3, 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 state Material requirements and call out specific part numbers and specifications.

3) 3.2.2 (v) Can NAVAIR please elaborate on what a graceful shutdown is?
-The verbiage should be changed to read standard shutdown.
 This will be done in the final solicitation.

4) During reconfiguration of the MSO stations, what is the end-users anticipated maximum amount of time spent in being able to reconfigure the MSO stations?

-This has not been determined by the USG.

5) Reading the SOW, am I understanding that the USN only wants touch-screen displays covering the areas of the functional hardware to reduce the cost of the overall training aid?

-Yes

<DESC>Q:  In developing the keyboard tray and recess for the Laptop Display in the C-144 configuration, once the training device is moved to the C-130 configuration, will NAVAIR be satisfied with only removing the Laptop Display and leaving the recess, or will NAVAIR like a reconfigurable tray area also to better match the crew station look and feel of the C-130 station.

A:  The tray needs to be reconfigurable to match the crew station look and feel.

<p>Location: USACE, Louisville District</p>
<p>Title: TAM AE Design Services-Small Business for projects within the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) boundaries of the USACE Transatlantic Middle East District.</p>
<p>Description(s): <br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The proposed IDIQ is to provide A-E services including all phases of design of renovation and new construction; from planning through preparation of final design/build packages and design/bid/build construction documents. Elements include, but are not limited to, project design, quality control, site investigations (topographic surveys, geotechnical subsurface investigations, environmental testing, and as-built research), planning and programming documentation, transportation planning, force protection, life safety, infrastructure investigation and design, Title II design support during construction, and subject matter expert support for all Transatlantic Middle East District (TAM) stakeholders throughout the CENTCOM AOR and for our Worldwide customers. Preparation of design and construction documents incorporating applicable Unified Facility Criteria (UFCs), international codes, and local codes in the countries within the CENTCOM AOR (design standards, expectations, and culture). The CENTCOM AOR has 20 nations, which stretches from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District Contracting Division (LDCD) intends to award in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6, up to two (2), A-E Design Services SATOCs set aside to small businesses, with an estimated overall capacity of $10 million. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. See Paragraphs 3 and 4 for general information on the A-E selection process. Up to two awards may be issued up to one year from the date of the release of this FBO announcement. The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years. Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. There is no minimum or maximum on the amount of individual task orders, except the overall contract value will not be exceeded. The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to expend capacity in advance of the contract maximum period as necessary to meet operational needs.</p>
<p>Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract." Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Projected contract award date is March 2019 for the initial one-year period. It is the Government's intent to make a minimum of one and maximum of two contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-price or labor-hour. It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed among the design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa. TAM's mission has further expanded to include several new worldwide programs, including the Center of Standardization for Contingency Standard Designs, the Technical Center of Expertise for Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection, and Satellite Communications. Based on TAM's newly acquired missions, it is projected that the Design Services Architect-Engineer Contracts will include all locations where TAM has been designated program manager. While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the CENTCOM region, the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR, including the locations for TAM's newly acquired worldwide missions. The A-E firm must be willing to service locations worldwide including performing site visits. The A-E firm will be required to perform work in all countries located within TAM's Area of Responsibility (CENTCOM). The A-E Firm will need a working understanding of all International Codes, Host Nation Requirement (design, construction and permitting) requirements, Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), etc. as well as extensive knowledge of the UFCs. The incumbent's understanding of cultural as well will be considered in the selection process as well. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM internet site at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>NOTE: All firms shall be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as competitively to general small business interests to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.</p>

VIA TRIESTE 76
RAVENNA 48122
<DESC>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is to design and build a fully operational Guardian Angels Operations Facility
(GAOF) for the 57th Ready Qualified to Stand-by (RQS) Squadron, including Squadron Operations, Warehouse,
and Aquatic facilities, at Aviano Air Force Base, Aviano, Italy. The facility must be compatible with applicable
Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force, and Aviano Air Base Installation Design Guide standards.

Site functions include an exterior area for a Protection of the Force and Family (POTFF) turf area of 1,500 GSM
(16,150 GSF) and a 9.3 GSM (100 GSF) storage function for the POTFF area (storage to be Government Furnished
Government Installed [GFGI]). Other exterior functions on the site include sidewalks and flatwork at the Squadron
Patio, concrete pads for an Intermediate Storage Unit (ISU) area, ISU staging area, Armory ISU, and Climbing
Apparatus equipment.
Other concrete surface pads and stucco- finished concrete masonry unit (CMU) enclosures are
designated at the power generator and fuel tanks as well as the enclosed Mechanical Yard. In the same area is a
concrete pad within the CMU trash enclosure. Concrete driveway and apron surfaces are required at forklift service
entries, and concrete stoops are designated at service room entries.

The building must not exceed 7,285 GSM, (78,415 GSF) to comply with the DD1391. The interior programmed
functions are divided into Squadron facilities (6,785 GSM [73,033 GSF]) and Aquatic facilities (500 GSM [(5,382
GSF]) Vertical requirements vary by use area: approximately an 11 m (36- foot) two- story high bay warehouse
facility, a 10 m (33- foot) two- story squad operations area, a 7 m (23- foot) one- story aquatics area, and a 30.5 m (100- foot) parachute drying tower.
The building must contain a minimum of two fully enclosed stairs and one 2-
stop hydraulic elevator. Egress widths that meet Italian code for exit width per occupant are widened stairs or a
third stair.

Functional areas within the 57th Squadron facility include three distinct program needs: Command Operations,
Recovery Team, and Logistics. Building elements within Command Operations include squadron briefing and break
rooms, shared and single- person work spaces and offices, training rooms, a conference facility, flight planning
areas, and designated secured areas. Recovery Team areas generally include mission planning rooms , flight rooms,
gear supply and maintenance areas, and the cages and POTFF functions with supporting Physical Therapy offices
and exam rooms.
Logistics areas in general include a high bay space with a 2-ton hoist crane, gear and weapons
preparation, maintenance and storage facilities, parachute packing and storage, interior ISUs and supply storage and
distribution functions, and scuba and Aquatics areas. All program functions are served by common support
restrooms and shower/locker facilities.

The design also requires support areas that include mechanical rooms, telecom and electrical
rooms, custodial rooms, and an elevator machine room, as well as general circulation space
throughout the building. The entire facility must be designed and built as a Primary Gathering Facility within a
Controlled Perimeter per UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, Appendix B, Tables
B-1 and B-2, and as directed by UFC 4-010-05, The design must also address host nation requirements and local
jurisdiction force protection criteria.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">The primary focus of the U.S. civilian-assistance program is to develop a stable, secure and tolerant Pakistan with a vibrant economy. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">Many local institutions face institutional capacity issues and overall weaknesses in their internal controls, financial management and absorptive capacity. Weak systems that are not transparent and lack accountability and limited human resource capacity of implementing partners pose risks. This has accentuated the need for risk assessment and capacity development to be in place to ensure that resources are spent in a transparent, efficient and effective manner and to ensure that the projects achieve their objectives within the specified timeframes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">In order to address the various fiduciary risks and capacity development needs, services are being requested to assist USAID in providing a wide range of services for USAID indirect partners and key institutions in Pakistan, including those that work on increasing participation of and reducing vulnerabilities of women and other excluded groups. USAID/Pakistan defines Indirect G2G Partner as Government of Pakistan entities that do not receive direct funding from USAID. Instead these government entities indirectly provide support to G2G activities and play a crucial role in the effective use of the host country systems by USAID. These services will include provision of the technical assistance required to assess organizational fiduciary risks. In addition, support is needed in risk management and capacity development that will enable organizations to support USAID and Pakistan&rsquo;s common goals and development objectives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin;">It is important that USAID implementing partners have sound, effective, transparent and accountable systems in place to manage public funds and that there is a decrease in opportunities for corruption, inefficiencies and mismanagement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sound systems can facilitate:</span></p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information and Technology (Ol&T), has a requirement for NetApp storage augmentation which shall include hardware, software, installation and remote technical support and maintenance. Specifically, VA currently utilizes NetApp FAS2520 storage appliances to store backup and/or archive data at approximately 260 facilities across Ol&T Service Delivery and Engineering, Field Operations (FO) Regions 1 through 6. VA requires the augmentation of twenty-nine (29) of these appliances to add between 10 and 280 terabytes of additional usable capacity per site. This will be accomplished by adding disk shelves, disk drives, higher capacity controllers and NetApp ONTAP unit testing software. This augmentation is required to bring VA into compliance with VA Security Directive 6500, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publications 800-34 and 800-53, and VA Continuous Readiness in Information Security Program. Specifically, the hardware will enable the VA to implement standardized backups protected by 256-bit AES encryption using Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 validated cryptographic libraries for the VistA electronic health record system. The Contractor shall deliver, install, cable, and configure all hardware and software components within 6 months after award and shall provide 12 months of 24/365 maintenance and technical support to include onsite support if required

<p><br />FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency <br />requirements, 10 USC 2304(c)(1)</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-2: Unusual and compelling urgency, 10 USC 2304(c)(2) FAR 6.302-5: Authorized or Required <br />by Statute, 10 USC 2304(c)(5) FAR 13.501(a): Simplified Acquisition Procedures<br />Other: FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) Item peculiar to one manufacturer (e.g. brand name item, product, or <br />feature of a product peculiar to one manufacturer.</p>
<p>5. Reasons for Authority Cited:</p>
<p>a. The Defense Forensic Science Center has a mission critical requirement for the procurement of <br />the Evofinder&reg; Ballistic Identification System (BIS) for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation <br />Laboratory Trace Evidence Branch. The Defense Forensic Science<br />-1-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />FDO/ MICC Control No. 18-U039<br />Center (DFSC) located at the Gillem Enclave in Georgia provides forensic laboratory services to the <br />Department of Defense investigative agencies and other Federal law enforcement agencies. This is a <br />materials science hardware and software solution supporting U.S. Army Criminal Investigation <br />Laboratory (USACIL) Firearm examiners with the scanning and correlation comparison of bullets and <br />cartridges for forensic evidence examinations and research.</p>
<p>b. The Evofinder Automated Ballistics Identification system (BIS) is a scanning device that <br />captures 2D &amp; 3D digital images of bullets and cartridge cases to store in a database for the <br />purpose of comparison and matching. This instrument fills two capability gaps at USACIL. The first <br />is as a virtual microscope; the scans produced by the Evofinder are able to extrapolate certain <br />individual characteristics (such as faint granular breech face marks) on bullets and cartridge <br />cases better than visual comparison on a comparison microscope. Having the Evofinder will allow an <br />examiner another tool to visualize individual characteristics for comparison that would have gone <br />unnoticed using just a comparison microscope. The second gap is the correlation software. <br />Currently, USACIL has no tool to establish a correlation score for the comparison of two ballistic <br />samples. With the recent popularity of quantitative measurements, a tool that is capable of <br />producing correlation scores is essential for USACIL Firearms to be able to develop a quantitative <br />measurement.</p>
<p>c. Leeds Precision Instruments is the only North American distributor who offers the required <br />Evofinder&reg; Automated Ballistics Identification system (BIS) produced by ScannBi Technology Europe <br />GmbH. Leeds has provided a Sole Source Letter.</p>
<p>d. Alternatives. Currently there are four commercially available three-dimensional ballistic <br />scanners: Evofinder, Cadre/Gel Sight, Sensofar, and Alicona. Only the Evofinder had the required <br />capabilities to provide high resolution scans of both cartridge cases and bullets, and has <br />supporting correlation or comparison software.</p>
<p>e. Impacts of selecting an alternative model and brand ballistic identification system.<br />1) If another brand is selected, then USACIL would not meet the mission requirement for an <br />automated system for scanning, correlating and comparing the crime scene forensic evidence from <br />both bullets and cartridge cases.<br />2) USACIL will not have another tool to visualize individual characteristics for comparison that <br />would have gone unnoticed using just a comparison microscope.<br />3) USACIL will not have the computer software assistance to establish a correlation score for the <br />comparison of two ballistic samples.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:<br />To promote competition the MICC-Fort Gordon will continue to synopsize and conduct market research <br />to ensure there are other vendors that can provide the requirement.</p>
<p>7. Actions to Increase Competition:<br />DFSC research scientists are continually researching sources of information and services to enable <br />forensic examiners to conduct effective and reliable examinations. Market research consists of <br />internet research, literature reviews, discussions with vendors, and other professional resources <br />attending forensic science and technical conferences and</p>

A Listing of the Sources, if Any That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition. <br />None<br />11.

<p>Going forward, all new entities registering in GSA's System for Award Management (SAM), as well as existing registrations being updated or renewed, will require the submission of an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  Effective June 11, 2018, entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov to apply only for federal assistance opportunities such as grants, loans, and other financial assistance programs, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  Additionally, Effective June 29, 2018, all non-Federal entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and are proactive in maintaining the SAM registrations in an "Active" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an "Active" SAM registration.  More information can be found at www.gsa.gov/samupdate.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR A SOLE SOURCE AWARD
FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs
Office of Procurement Acquisition and Logistics
       Strategic Acquisition Center - Frederick
       321 Ballenger Center Drive Ste.125
       Frederick, MD 21703
      
2.  Description of Action:

The proposed sole source action is for a one-year firm-fixed price (FFP) effort to procure the training required to enable the Technology Acquisition Center s (TAC) GS-1102 workforce to obtain the recently created Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Core-Plus Specialization in Digital Services (FAC-C-DS).  It is proposed that this training be procured from ICF International Inc. (ICF), 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031.  

3.  Description of Supplies or Services: 

The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics (OPAL), TAC is to support our Nation s Veterans by providing acquisition and logistics solutions for VA.  In meeting these goals, TAC is responsible for preparing and executing quality contracts that support the Information Technology (IT) efforts and needs of its customers across VA, which enables our customers to provide best value solutions to Veterans and their families.  TAC has a large population of General Schedule series 1102 s (GS-1102 s) that are responsible for these IT procurements, all of whom either have obtained Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C), or are working toward obtaining FAC-C certification.  On May 18, 2018, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) launched the new digital services certification program (FAC-C-DS) with the goal of creating a digital IT acquisition professional (DITAP) community.  This new specialization aligns with the President s Management Agenda in the areas of modernizing the government s IT, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our services, and developing a 21st century workforce.  A common component of these strategies is delivering data, information, and transactional services across multiple platforms to transform how citizens interact with their government.  To develop this new generation of digital services, the workforce must learn and apply new skills.  Buying digital services is not a skill that is gained through the FAC-C curriculum, thereby necessitating a specialized and immersive training and development program called the DITAP, which leads to the FAC-C-DS. This specialization meets an urgent need for digital services expertise and will be part of a larger effort to raise the overall competency of the acquisition workforce in acquiring IT solutions.  

In order for its GS-1102 workforce to understand how to craft acquisitions to procure digital services, TAC requires the training necessary to obtain FAC-C-DS certification for its GS-1102 workforce.  The training program curriculum shall be validated by OFPP and U.S. Digital Service (USDS). 

The contractor shall provide all of the labor, materials, transportation, and other incidentals necessary to provide the training necessary under DITAP in order for the TAC GS-1102 workforce to obtain FAC-C-DS certification.  The curriculum shall be based upon an open source learning management system, allowing students to interact, and shall feature self-directed, guided and applied learning, classroom instruction, case studies, guest speakers, and hands-on skills building through a live digital assignment, all of which the contractor is responsible for providing.

This training shall be provided to the TAC GS-1102 workforce by end of FY2019.  It is anticipated that this will be accomplished via four (4) cohorts of twenty-five (25) students each, with each cohort lasting approximately six (6) months.  There will also be an optional cohort for an additional twenty-five (25) students.  For each cohort, the validated training program shall consist of:

9 days of classroom instruction consisting of 3 separate, 3-day face to face sessions*
15 hours of virtual instructor led training
12 hours per week of asynchronous, self-paced material
Participants receive up to 80 continuous learning points

*The contractor shall travel to the TAC office in Eatontown, NJ, in order to provide the face to face classroom instruction required for each of the cohorts.

The total estimated value of the proposed action is $768,325.00, consisting of a base period with a value of $614,660.00 and an optional task with a value of $153,665.00.
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:    

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, entitled  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5,  Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items .

 5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  

As stated above, on May 18, 2018, OFPP issued a memorandum launching the new digital services certification program (FAC-C-DS) with the goal of creating a DITAP community.  The memorandum stated that,  Contracting professionals assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services over the FAR Subpart 13.5 certain commercial item threshold, currently $7 million (or $13 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(c)), are required to be certified.   It further stated that  contracting professionals assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services in FY-19
thru FY-21 over the above threshold shall obtain the specialization within two years of assignment.   These two statements explain why it is vital for the TAC 1102 workforce to obtain the FAC-C-DS specialization.  Not only will the specialization raise the overall competency of the workforce in acquiring IT solutions, which is TAC s main procurement responsibility in support of its VA customers, but it will also enable TAC to meet the requirements of the OFPP memorandum within the stated timeframe.  

The OFPP memorandum indicated that both government and commercial training providers can offer DITAP to government contracting professionals, and that approved programs include those offered by either government or industry and validated by OFPP and U.S. Digital Service.  It further states that a list of validated programs and information on how to apply shall be maintained by the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) on www.fai.gov and identifies the TechFAR Hub at https://techfarhub.cio.gov as an additional source of information.  

ICF was the first and is currently the only government certified DITAP vendor.  In order for the TAC s large 1102 workforce to obtain this specialization by the end of FY19, the training program will need to begin right away upon contract award.  Virtually all of the TAC s 1102 staff routinely work on digital service efforts as defined in the OFPP memorandum, so delaying the training in order to allow for other vendors to become certified could inhibit TAC s ability to support its IT customers.  While other acquisition organizations likely focus on various types of procurement and can phase the DITAP training over multiple years, the TAC is unique in that its main mission is IT procurement, so delaying training beyond FY19 has a much more significant impact.  At this time, there is no way of knowing how long it will take for any other vendors that have not yet sought approval to have a certified training program.  However, it is unlikely that a vendor without a certified training program will be able to develop the curriculum for a 6-month training program and receive certification in time for the TAC to begin the training early enough in FY19 to be complete by the end of the year.  As a result, it is imperative that TAC procure this training from ICF.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  

Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any responses to the synopsis that are received will be considered for future requirements. 

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  

The Government will conduct market research when future needs arise to ascertain if OFPP and USDS certify the DITAP training programs of other vendors, which would enable future actions to be competed. 

8.  Market Research: 

On August 23, 2018, VA reviewed the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) and TechFAR Hub websites and found that no other vendors other than ICF currently have a certified DITAP training program.

On May 18, 2018, OFPP issued a memorandum launching the new digital services certification program (FAC-C-DS) with the goal of creating a DITAP community.  The OFPP memorandum indicated that both government and commercial training providers can offer DITAP to government contracting professionals, and that approved programs include those offered by either government or industry and validated by OFPP and U.S. Digital Service.  It further stated that a list of validated programs and information on how to apply shall be maintained by FAI on www.fai.gov and identified the TechFAR Hub at https://techfarhub.cio.gov as an additional source of information.  

TAC reviewed FAI, which does contain information on the FAC-C-DS specialization, but does not yet include a list of validated DITAP programs.  FAI does include a link on how to apply to the DITAP, which leads to the website for the existing ICF Digital IT Acquisition Professional Certification Course.  The ICF website indicates that ICF is the first government-certified DITAP vendor.  TAC then visited the TechFAR Hub and found that the only course available is offered by ICF.  As ICF is the only government-certified DITAP vendor currently available, TAC must enter into a sole source contract with ICF to meet its need for this training program.  A search of the VIP database indicated that ICF is not a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) or Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).
