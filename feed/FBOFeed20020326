Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFANW), in conjunction with the Commander, Navy Region Northwest, plans to offer for privatization, the existing water distribution system and wastewater system at Jackson Park Naval Housing (including NAVHOSP Bremerton) in   Washington State.

As a  result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the utility system. The successful firm will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the Government. The successful firm may or may not be the supplier of the commodity procured by the Government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the upgrades, maintenance, repairs, and replacement of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service connection within the service area in accordance with industry standards. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments   required to acquire, upgrade, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The Contractor's proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award. Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. No Offeror   will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP. Proposal due dates will be identified in the solicitation.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  1.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Rockwell Collins Government Systems of Cedar Rapids, Iowa for six (6) ARC-210 (RT-1747D) Radios for use within the USQ-146 based jammer.  The requirement is for a fixed price contract for delivery within 15 days of contract award.   

The RT-1747D configuration functional capabilities include a simplex two-way communication of normal and secure voice amplitude modulated (AM) or frequency modulated (FM) signals in the 30.000 MHz to 400 MHz radio frequency (RF) bands.  The RT-1747D also provides the following modes of operation:  a dedicated guard receiver which can provide continuous monitoring of the guard frequency in UHF/VHF bands of 243.000 MHz or 121.500 MHz; a receive-only mode of operation in normal and secure voice from 108.000 through 117.9975 MHz (AM); a maritime mode of operation in the 156.000 MHz through 162.025 MHz frequency band, and variable AM and FM electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) mode(s), these being HAVEQUICK, HAVEQUICK II, and SINCGARS.  The RT-1747D utilizes several types of data buses to convey control and status information among the various WRAs making up the system. These include the MIL-STD-1553B AVMUX Bus, the Remote Control Data Bus, the Antenna and Filter Data Bus, and the DS-101 Data Loading Bus. The RT-1747D provides 8.33 kHz channel spacing capability for compatibility with EuroCae (ED-23B), and is software loadable using Advanced Memory Loader Verifier (AMLV). The RT-1747D has a 70 MHz half-duplex converter and the software needed to select half-duplex channels, including SATCOM channels, and operate in the 70 MHz half-duplex mode for UHF beyond line of sight operation. Additionally, the RT-1747D can supply a 67.44 MHz IF output when under the control from an AN/USQ-113 jammer.  

Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS) Cedar Rapids, Iowa is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the AN/ARC-210 Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment, and is the only firm with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment, and experience to perform this effort within the required time frame.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above.

<DESC>Under the direction of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Central Regional Air Partnership (CenRAP) and Visibility Improvement-State and Tribal Association of the Southeast (VISTAS) have been tasked with addressing air quality impacts from particulate matter, specifically regional haze (e.g., visibility) and providing recommendations for control of air pollutant emissions from sources that affect the Breton National Wilderness Area and other Gulf of Mexico proximate Class I areas.  Pursuant to the Department of the Interior’s Minerals Management Service’s (MMS) responsibility under the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act Amendments of 1978 to use technology, precautions and techniques sufficient to prevent or minimize damage to the environment, and obligations to the EPA to assure coordination of air pollution control regulation for OCS and adjacent onshore area emissions, MMS has agreed to provide meteorological monitoring equipment to support both the CenRAP and VISTAS missions.  This equipment will measure the vertical profile of wind speed and direction, and virtual temperature, as well as surface wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, and relative humidity for use in air quality modeling.  MMS intends to award two contracts under Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, using commercial item procurement procedures.  Negotiations will be undertaken with the Central States Air Resource Administrators (CenSARA) on behalf of CenRAP and Southeastern States Air Resource Managers (SESARM) on behalf of VISTAS for the installation, operation, maintenance, and data processing required to achieve full operations capability for the loaned equipment.  Monitoring data gathered under these activities will be processed by the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL).  Other parties having an interest in either activity may identify their qualifications and capabilities no later than 31 March 2002.  Any party interested in participating must demonstrate qualifications and capabilities in installation, operation, and maintenance of Vaisala-manufactured LAP-3000 radar profilers, 915 Mega-Hertz Radio Acoustic Sounding Systems, RMY0-05305-5 anemometers, PTA-427 barometric pressure gauges, and HMP35C temperature and relative humidity sensors; and have an established relationship with NOAA-FSL.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is there a solicitation associated with this announcement.  However, any interest shown will be reviewed by the Government and used only for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interests of the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may provide qualifications and capabilities documentation to DOI-MMS, Attn:  Jeanie Kampschroeder (MS 2500), 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, Phone 703-787-1352 or Fax 703-787-1009.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, Virginia intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Raytheon Technical Services Company (Raytheon), 6125 East 21st Street, Indianapolis, IN 46219-2058 as a follow-on to the original contract for the privatization of NAWCAD Indianapolis.

In 1996 NAWCAD Indianapolis was closed and privatized in-place in accordance with recommendations from the 1995 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission.  Title to the preponderance of all personal property located at NAWCAD Indianapolis has been transferred to Raytheon.  Raytheon possesses land and facilities formerly comprising NAWCAD Indianapolis under the terms of a long-term lease agreement with the City of Indianapolis acting by and through the Department of Metropolitan Development.

The contract will provide for the furnishing of the integrated functional capabilities previously provided by the NAWCAD Indianapolis in support of various Marine Corps Programs.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-(1)(2)(ii) and (iii) supplies/services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.  The term of the contract is planned to be a one-year base period with up to four one-year options.  Raytheon is the only known responsible source that can provide the required integrated functional capabilities, products, and services.  Interested parties may submit questions relating to this requirement to the MARCORSYSCOM Quantico, Virginia.  The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>On November,20, 2001 the Social Security Administration posted a sources sought synopsis to EPS/CBD for "Assistive Technology Hardware and Support Services" (Reference-Number-SSA-02-EWD-SSS). 

This posting (SSA-02-EWD-SSS-2) is to provide potential offerors with additional information on the Government's requirements. There are two files attached/uploaded to this posting.

The attached files are DRAFT copies of the Social Security Administration's anticipated statement of work document, and proposal evaluation criteria, addressing potential Agency requirements for technologies serving employees with disabilities (EWD). Potential offerors and interested parties are asked to closely review these documents and provide comments, questions, and requests for clarifications IN WRITING to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at: randall.pickwell@ssa.gov by C.O.B. 4/15/02. No other forms of correspondence regarding this matter will be accepted or acknowledged.

The Government seeks vendor community input to better focus and refine requirements, and streamline the any future procurement. Upon receipt and consideration of vendor comments, suggestions, and questions, the Contracting Officer will post responses in this forum. Any formal request for proposal issued following these responses to vendor inquiries will likely be based on a "total solution/turn-key" approach to meeting the Government's needs. Therefor, potential offerors are encouraged to explore the possibilities of partnering with other contractors to better address the Government's anticipated requirements. This posting, and the referenced attachments, DO NOT constitute a request for proposals, and are for informational purposes only.

<DESC>TITLE: Technical Assistance to Government Of Egypt's Egyptian Environmental Policy Program

The United States AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Mission in Egypt (USAID/Egypt), in cooperation with the Government of Egypt's Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, is providing notification to potential offerors of its intention  to award a non-competitive contract modification to Chemonics International for follow on activities to its current contract No 263-.250-0-00-6090-00 for the Cairo Air Improvement Project (CAIP).  The non-competitive contract modification will provide funding  for $1.5 to $2.2 million (to the basic Cairo Air Improvement Project contract of $56 million) of long and short term US expatriate and Egyptian professional level of effort for the period from May 1, 2002, to September 30, 2003.

The goal of the non-competitive contract modification will be to implement activities under the first objective (Improved Air Quality) of the Egyptian Environmental Policy Program, Tranche 2.  Under this contract modification, Chemonics International would continue activities stipulated in the Cairo Air Improvement Project to introduce policies directed towards the following interventions specified in the existing contract: (1) Reduce the total suspended particulate (TSP) emissions from diesel-fueled buses by expanding the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel for public municipal bus fleets;  (2) reduce the concentration of airborne lead in and near lead smelters; and, (3) Identify and implement other interventions to reduce Cairo?s air pollution.  During this period, USAID will support long and short term U.S. expatriate technical advisors located in Cairo in order to provide technical assistance and support for a series of agreed upon activities with the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency of the Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs, the Cairo Transit Authority, and the Governorate of Qualyoubia.  Key activities will include support, training and technical assistance for: 1) development of the framework for an air quality strategy; 2) development of a plan to convert the Cairo Transport Authority bus fleet currently powered by diesel engines to CNG power; 3) development and testing of lead smelter site remediation guidelines for the sites previously used by the relocated lead smelters.

Chemonics International is being considered for this non-competitive extension due to the fact that it has previous and current in-country experience in technical as well as institutional aspects of air quality management and policy.  It has specific experience in working with compressed natural gas (CNG) for public transportation buses and in lead smelter relocation and remediation of decommissioned lead smelters in Egypt.  Chemonics International also has a fully mobilized and operational workforce in Egypt. 

 A cost-plus-fixed fee amendment to the existing contract is expected under the authority of the FAR Part 6.302-1 ?Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition? unless the Contracting Officer determines that more than one source can meet the Government?s needs, as a result of this notice.  To respond to this notice and to be considered, offerors must see Numbered Notes 22 and 25 and must strictly comply with the attached submission instructions. All responsible sources may submit an expression of interest that must include capability statements.  USAID/Egypt will not respond to requests nor consider proposals that do not comply with the submission instructions.

It is the sole responsibility of offerors to ensure that their expression of interest and all necessary documents reach the Contracting Officer, USAID/Egypt, at the above address not later than 14 days from the date of this notice in the FBO.  Mr. Kinney can be reached at email address:  gkinney@usaid.gov.

<DESC>Regional Contracting Office in REDSO/ESA invites U.S. firms and organizations to submit proposals for a contract with the United States Agency for International Development  (USAID) to establish an Agricultural Enterprise Finance Institution in Southern Sudan.   This requirement is under the Southern Sudan Agriculture Revitalization Project that seeks to increase capacity for agricultural production and marketing.  The project rationale is based on the premise that economic recovery has begun across large stable areas of southern Sudan that have not seen conflict for several years, and that viable investments can now be made.  The Agricultural Enterprise Finance component will be implemented in two phases.  Phase I is conceived of as a pilot activity expected to take no less than five years.  Phase I is expected to consist of the creation of a sustainable microfinance institution, including: the elaboration of the charter; the establishment of a board of directors; the establishment of a headquarters and several offices; the recruitment and training of personnel; the identification of appropriate, demand-driven loan products; tests of the potential for sustainable microlending as a sustainable financial service; and examination of the need and potential for small business lending and venture capital investment.   The total value of the proposed contract is expected to be $7,000,000, of which about $3,000,000 will be used to capitalize the microfinance institution.  The Request for Proposals will identify some potential measures of the efficacy and efficiency of the microfinance institution, and offerors will be encouraged to propose their own measures.  The microfinance institution will operate within a strict parameter of offering 50% of all loans to women or women's groups.  This gender equity parameter  must be a fundamental operating principle of the microfinance institution since women are 60% of the population in southern Sudan and produce 80% of the food.  USAID generally expects the average value of loans to groups or individuals to be approximately $500, but will encourage offerors to propose an appropriate range of values for loan products.  USAID also encourages bidders to propose competitive mechanisms to offer credit to two additional target groups:  agribusiness entrepreneurs who have graduated from the agriculture and business skills training component to be implemented under the Southern Sudan Agricultural Revitalization Program (subject of RFA: 623-02-011, posted on 2/6/02); and IDPs/refugees who have already returned to their home areas.  USAID estimates that approximately 50% of graduates should qualify for loans, and that approximately 10% of loans should go to IDPs/refugees already returned to their home areas, but USAID requests bidders to propose appropriate targeting percentages to ensure that these loans are a positive element for the microfinance institution's financial status, not a drag nor a set-aside.  If a determination is made at the end of five years to continue with Phase 2, then another full and open competition will be done to select the implementing organization.  All questions related to this notice must be addressed in writing by letter, fax or e-mail to the contact points, with reference to the RFP number and title and your complete organization name, street address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address. The RFP is projected to be issued on or about mid-March. It is the responsibility of the party downloading the RFP to ensure that the RFP has been received in its entirety and (USAID) bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Any amendments to the RFP will also be posted on the (FBO) website and interested parties should check the website regularly. A list of organizations which express interest in this RFP will be made available upon request. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The principal objectives of this program are to develop an exemplar of a selected Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI), from applications down to communications infrastructure, that can operate through a wide class of known and future cyber attacks and to develop system architectures that gracefully degrade system functionality in the face of attacks.  The subject system and network will reconfigure dynamically to optimize performance, functionality and survivability as threat conditions warrant.  Exemplar Mission-Critical System: The target exemplar military information system of the future is Joint Battlespace Infosphere.  Operationally, JBI is a combat information management system. Technically, it is a platform of processes, protocols and common core functions. JBI promotes information interoperability between many individual information systems and acts as an intermediary between these systems. A JBI is a publish/subscribe process involving a set of clients interconnected via a network to a set of core services.  The instantiation of a JBI in this program will be the core services and the functional components needed to execute a mission-critical scenario.  The scenario starts with an objective that requires an air strike on an enemy target.  The near-real time activities include planning an air combat mission based on a set of specified parameters and creating an air tasking order (ATO).  The ATO is sent to the squadron for assignment to a ready element.  The mission is then executed.  At some time between launch but before the objective strike the weather parameters, in this case the winds at the target area, change to such a degree that the predicted collateral damage is unacceptable and a mission modification is necessary.  In real-time the ATO is modified and transmitted to the executing element.  Throughout the scenario coordination between the mobility command and the combat command is achieved within the JBI.  During this scenario a Red Team conducts a prolonged, determined cyber attack that, if successful, will deny, disrupt, degrade or otherwise harm mission critical functionality of the JBI to the operators.  The Dem/Val program will demonstrate the following survivability goals for the exemplar JBI:  1. Provide 100% of JBI critical functionality when under a determined red team attack.  2. Detect 95% of large-scale attacks within 10 minutes of attack initiation and 99% of  attacks within 4 hours with less than 1% false alarm rate.  3. Display meaningful attack state alarms.  4. Prevent 95% of attacks from achieving attacker objectives for 12 hours.  5. Reduce low-level alerts by a factor of 1000.  6. Show survivability versus cost/performance trade-off.  The cyber-survivability technologies necessary to achieve the OASIS Dem/Val objectives, as previously stated, are being developed under OASIS and FTN programs. Previous DARPA programs in Information Survivability and Information Assurance & Survivability have also produced relevant technologies. The purpose of the OASIS Dem/Val program is to leverage these investments, in combination with commercially available first-generation and second-generation security technologies, to create a pathfinder for the DoD. This program will be one of the major DARPA efforts aimed at accelerating the transition of DARPA-developed cyber defense technologies to DoD operational systems.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  Two awards are expected to be made for the system design phase and a down-selection is expected to be made for the system development and demonstration phase.  Program duration is 24 months.  Awards for the system design phase, 12 months duration, are expected to be up to $5M each and award for the system development phase, 12 months in duration, is expected to be up to $9M.  While this solicitation covers both phases, contract award will be made based on the merits of the proposals for Phase 1.  Phase 2 will be negotiated with the selected performer after a planned down-select that will be made at the end of Phase 1.  Recently, DARPA sponsored a study that produced "Considerations in Developing Survivable Architectures for GIG Systems."  This study is intended to be a point of departure for this solicitation.  Phase 1 is a 12 month effort and will develop a design and a development plan for the target JBI.  A Preliminary Design Review will be conducted late in the 2nd quarter of FY03 and a Critical Design Review will be conducted late in the 4th quarter of FY03.  Phase 2 is a 12-month development and test effort.  The Phase 2 selection will be based on a competitive evaluation of the design and development plans created in Phase 1.  Each design will undergo independent assessment to validate performance predictions and assurance arguments.  DARPA reserves the right to select none of the performers at the down-select point.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA's release.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Technology Office (DARPA/ITO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Proposal, by accessing the URL below: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-16   After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must submit the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and submitting it attached to the "original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Proposal.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/ITO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/ITO Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Details in Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word '97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-16, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy (Number) of  2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 4:00 PM (ET) Friday, May 24, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-16, ORGANICALLY ASSURED AND SURVIVABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (OASIS) DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION (DEM/VAL) PROGRAM will remain open until 4:00 PM (ET) Friday, March 28, 2003.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, March 28, 2003. While the proposals submitted after Friday, May 24, 2002, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-16 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and full proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations.html.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-16 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished in a two-step process as follows. The first step will be a scientific review of each proposal. The second step will be an oral review.  The first step criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance, are as follows:  (1)  Overall Systems Engineering Approach: The overall systems engineering methodology, from requirements definition to trade-off studies to integration and validation, must be clearly identifiable. Of specific concern is the offeror's strategy for managing the risk inherent in integrating leading-edge, and potentially immature, technologies in creating a stable prototype.  (2)  Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem: Application of new technology or application of existing technology in a new way that is advantageous to the Program objectives.  Identification of types of cyber survivability technologies offeror intends to use, and how the offeror intends to get developed and emerging technologies.  The ability to meet the quantitative program goals defined earlier.  (3)  Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations or consortia members must be clearly shown. Team experience with design and build of large-scale information systems and networks and thorough knowledge of and familiarity with emerging cyber survivability technologies are essential.  Offeror's understanding of the JBI operating environment is also important.  (4)  Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA mission: The offeror must clearly address the trade-offs of performance, functionality and additional cost as a function of various levels of survivability.  (5)  Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition: Technology transition should be a major consideration in the design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for involving DoD transition organizations in the field assessment phase.  (6)  Cost Realism: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation will consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT DARPA BAA 02-13: Exploitation of 3-D Data (E3D). POCs: Dr. Robert Hummel (DARPA/IXO), FAX 703/696-2201/2203; Mr. Alan Frederick (DARPA/CMO), FAX: (703) 807-1728. 

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the development of novel and efficient techniques for rapidly exploiting 3-D sensor data to precisely locate and recognize targets. This procurement has three separate technology areas: Modeling, Target Acquisition, and Target Recognition.  The Modeling area seeks solutions for constructing and inserting target, clutter, and decoy models into the E3D system.  The Target Acquisition area seeks solutions for detecting and segmenting targets contained in a local block of 3-D data.  The Target Recognition area seeks solutions for analyzing segmented 3-D data blocks to determine target class, identity, and fingerprint. One award is anticipated in the Modeling area.  Two awards each are anticipated in the Target Acquisition and Target Recognition areas.

BACKGROUND: Sensors that provide 3-D information provide an opportunity to achieve precision recognition in the targeting process.  Whereas identification from 2-D images requires complex inferencing of 3-D information from 2-D scenes, precise identification from 3-D data should be achievable based on measurements obtained directly from the sensor data.  Accordingly, by making use of the 3-D data rapidly becoming available from advanced sensors, the E3D project should provide a quantum leap in the military's ability to perform targeting.  Additionally, E3D exploitation technology should drive the introduction of new 3-D sensors by creating a lucrative market for the use of 3-D data.

OBJECTIVES: The E3D project will develop technology to detect and recognize vehicular targets in 3-D data.  In the context of E3D, -recognition- means the labeling of an object in terms of class type, target type, and unique identity. The primary goals of the E3D project are 1) demonstrate that 3-D shape and structure of targets, together with spatial 3-D information about the context of the targets, can permit confident recognition over broad ranges of obscuration, configuration variation, and environment complexity, 2) demonstrate that 3-D shape and structure of targets, together with spatial 3-D information about the context of the targets, can permit confident decoy mitigation, and 3) working extensively with simulation data, identify requirements for 3-D resolution and target features for the purpose of performing acquisition, classification, identification, as well as -fingerprinting,- of targets according to their 3-D features.

TECHNICAL APPROACH: Modeling, Target Acquisition, and Target Recognition technology will be developed in three phases.  A fourth phase is planned, but is not included as part of this solicitation. Phase I and Phase II will last 12 months each, and Phase III and Phase IV will last 9 months each.  In Phase I, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting models of accessible targets.  These techniques will be used to build 75 target identification models and 20 target class models.  The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets under partial obscuration conditions, with an identification probability of 0.85, a target rejection rate less than 5%, and a processing time of 3 minutes per target or less.  In Phase II, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting models of denied targets and clutter.   The target model library will be expanded to 150 target identification models and 50 target class models. The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets in close proximity under 50% obscuration conditions in clutter containing primitivedecoys, with an identification probability of 0.9, a target rejection rate less than 3%, and a processing time of 5-times real time. In Phase III, the Modeling technology area will develop techniques for rapidly creating and inserting class models of denied targets and clutter -on the fly-.   The target model library will be expanded to 300 target identification models and 100 target class models.  The Target Acquisition and Recognition technology areas will develop techniques to locate and recognize articulating, reconfigurable targets in close proximity under 50% obscuration conditions in clutter containing complex decoys, with an identification probability of 0.95, a target rejection rate less than 2%, and real-time processing speeds.  The E3D project will provide clear and unambiguous milestones with well-defined performance metrics that allow the Government to determine progress towards achieving or exceeding project objectives. The results at the conclusion of each Phase will provide the basis for Go/No-Go decision for the subsequent Phase. E3D technologies will be evaluated and tested in Government facilities. Performers will be required to provide electronic reporting via the DARPA Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS).

<SUBJECT>A -- SOFTWARE FOR DISTRIBUTED ROBOTICS (SDR) INDOOR RECONNAISSANCE EXPERIMENTS/DEMONSTRATION
<SOLNBR>BAA02-14
<RESPDATE>040103
<ARCHDATE>04012004
<CONTACT>Dr. Douglas Gage, Program Manager, DARPA/ITO, Phone none, Fax 703-522-7161, Email none
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the demonstration of a distributed robotic system to address indoor reconnaissance applications.  Experiments should be proposed to assess the mission level performance of the distributed robotic system.  Establishing the sensitivity of system level performance to specific task details and to system design decisions is of special interest.  The system will be comprised of at least 100 small mobile robots, user interface(s), and any other required system level components.  Baseline performance levels will be established using a system of fixed-location sensors.  Indoor reconnaissance is a military application domain of increasing importance in a world of MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain), special operations, and counter terrorism.  The Software for Distributed Robotics (SDR) program is developing software to coordinate behaviors and provide user interfaces for systems of thousands of small robots.  This will enable large ensembles of extremely resource-limited small robots to perform useful tasks in the real world.  It will also permit humans to task and query the system as a collective, without having to interact with robots individually.  The SDR Program was initiated under DARPA BAA 99-20 with initial research projects addressing the technical areas of coordinated behaviors, communications between robots, human-robot interface, and computational architecture.  The projects are described online at http://www.darpa.mil/ito/research/sdr/projlist.html.  Research to date in distributed robotics has been driven principally by technology push.  The ultimate vision is to develop a system that addresses a real world application and is suitable for production and deployment.  This solicitation seeks proposals that address the following tasks: 1. Detailed specification of the reconnaissance missions/functions to be addressed, the target capabilities, and the relevant metrics and measures of performance.  2. The design and implementation of the test bed system to support the experiments and demonstration, including analysis and/or simulation to establish target performance goals.  3. Planning and execution of experiments.  Multiple mission scenarios may be proposed.  Scenarios are encouraged that address multiple types of targets (e.g., human intruders, sound sources, chemicals) and of tasks (e.g., covertly to locate a single target, to locate places where targets are concentrated, or to proof an area to ensure that no targets are present).  4. Planning and execution of the demonstration.  A final system demonstration should be proposed that addresses a "locate and protect" scenario as described in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  5. Assessment of experimental and demonstration results.  System performance metrics and lessons learned should be captured and presented in a final report.  The design and implementation task above should address the following research areas: Development of the behaviors of the individual robots, and the resulting system-level functionality, to support the complete mission cycle of preparation, programming, deployment, execution, monitoring and intervention, and recovery/disposal.  Specification and development of needed communications/coordination capabilities for the robot ensemble to execute the task.  Development of the user interface, to include a coherent user's model of the system's functional capabilities and expected performance levels, as well as the means to program the system for a specific mission task sequence, to monitor its performance in real time, and to assess its performance when it has completed its mission.  Utilization of existing robot assets is highly encouraged to minimize cost and technical/schedule risks.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Proposed efforts should cover an 18-month period of performance.  The project schedule should include a kick-off meeting within a month of the award date, in-progress reviews at 6-month intervals, and multiple experiments and a final demonstration.  Up to $2 M may be available for the remaining FY2002 fiscal year.  Up to two awards are anticipated, and teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA's release.  GENERAL INFORMATION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Technology Office (DARPA/ITO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Proposal, by accessing the URL below: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-14.  After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must submit the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and submitting it attached to the "original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Proposal.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/ITO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/ITO Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Details in Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word '97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-14, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy (Number) of  2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 4:00 PM (ET) Friday, May 10, 2002, to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-14, SOFTWARE FOR DISTRIBUTED ROBOTICS (SDR) INDOOR RECONNAISSANCE EXPERIMENTS/DEMONSTRATION will remain open until 4:00 PM (ET) Tuesday, April 1, 2003.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Tuesday, April 1, 2003. While the proposals submitted after Friday, May 10, 2002, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-14 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and full proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations.html.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-14 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit:  The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the technical value of the development and experimentation approach.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement


The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country.  This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.  Consistent with the urgency of this requirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative. While the initial identification of potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms capable of being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting sources relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment in December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, providing support for EDS screener training, and managing field service.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)  
The Transportation Security Administration has established the following anticipated subcontracting goals for this program (excluding the acquisition of EDS machines): 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business. 
As stated above, this announcement is seeking sources that can 1) compete at the prime contractor level and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal:  field equipment and provide training required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by December 31, 2002. 
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance sufficient to establish its capability to perform as the prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance to support the overall mission need as part of the team at the subcontractor level may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  For each of the various tasks cited above that you are capable of supporting, please provide detailed qualifications and references.  Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate.  
The capability statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov
not later than 1:00 PM EST on Tues, February 19, 2002.  All capability statements received from firms interested in participating at the subcontract level will be provided to the prospective prime contractors.  Statements exceeding the page lengths cited above or received after the due date will be discarded.  
The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<DESC>CBD notice to provide Six Sigma services was issued on 3/13/02.  This is additional information and/or clarification in response to an inquiry received concerning this RFQ.  Listed below will be the questions and the VA response. 1.  Is the hospital/system performing a pilot implementation for parts of the hospital or is Six Sigma being implemented across the organization? Response:  Across the VAMC Martinsburg.  This will be closely monitored and slowly will bring projects on line. 2. How are the pilot projects for Six Sigma being selected (e.g. through your strategic plan process)? Response:  This will be the mechanisim for monitoring and approving projects.  Strategic planning through quality council.   3.  Can a copy of a recent Carey Award submission be made available via a web site to better understand your existing planning processes and use of information and analysis? Response:  Have not applied to date. 4.  Have prospective students received "pre-requisite" training in statistics, team building, and other supporting skills that will enable them to acquire the high level statistical skills of Six Sigma within that time period? Response:  Participants have received team building and other supporting skills.  Statistics is a weakness. 5.  If comprehensive pre-training has not been done, would a contractor be non-compliant if they based a proposal on industry norms (to ensure a quality training output) or should all contractors limit student exposure to Six Sigma based on the constraints in the RFQ? Response:  Based on the constraints in the RFQ. 6.  There are many different tools that can be used to perform Six Sigma statistical analysis.  In order for a contractor to plan germane practical exercises, it would be valuable to know what tools the Six Sigma teams will be using? Response:  QI Macro's for Excel. 7.  Training will be held in the Post Theater which will support team exercises. 8.  How many "break out" rooms are available? Response:  As many as needed. 9.  Will rooms have the proper equipment needed to conduct practical exercises (computers, statistical calculators)? Response:  This is not available in the training rooms, but in each service. 10.  Will MOBIS qualification and/or accreditation suffice for this contract? Response:  No, submit all data as required by the RFQ. The due date of 4/2/02 remains unchanged.

The proposed contract action is for A/E Services, to review infrastructure system at DDJC, Tracy, CA, and revise as required in preparation for the new warehouse that is being designed and cons tructed.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate the infrastructure review with Stantec Consulting, Inc., Sacramento, CA.  The firm, Stantec Consulting, Inc. has been actively involved in the initial preliminary engineering effort at the DDJC, Tra cy, CA, and the effort being tasked now is a follow-on contract for continued provision of highly specialized A/E services.

This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.  The Government will consider responses received within 7 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  Any respondent must be able to substantiate any claim of possessing the requisite knowledge and background information of the project which may permit award to other than Stantec Consulting Inc.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement


The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country.  This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.  Consistent with the urgency of this requirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative.  While the initial selection of the potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms interesting in being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting goals relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment by December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, provide support for EDS screener training, and life cycle maintenance.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)  
The Transportation Security Administration has established the following subcontracting goals for this program: 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business. 
This announcement is seeking sources that can 1) participate as the prime contractor and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal:  field equipment and human resources required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by November 17, 2002.  
Any firm interested in  being prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  
Any firm interested in being a subcontractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  For each of the various tasks cited above that you are interested in, please provide detail qualifications and references.  Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate.  
The capability statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov
no later than 1:00 on Thursday, February 19, 2002.  All received capability statements will be provided to the prospective prime contractors.  Statements exceeding two pages or received after the due date will be discarded.  No additional information is available at this time.        

The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen, through competitive processes based on ideas and solutions, with consideration of cost and risk, will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

            DO NOT PROVIDE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME


This is a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information for solicitation F09634-02-R-0002.  The purpose of this is twofold; (1) to determine interest and capability and (2) to obtain industry input.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, licenses and other items or services necessary to perform the management and operation for the Air Force Reserve Recruitment Advertising  Program.  The Air Force Reserve Command is seeking a full-service recruitment-advertising agency for its advertising efforts.  The proposed $7-$13 million annual contract will include creative production and placement of all Air Force Reserve recruitment advertising in national magazines, newspapers, television, radio, internet, direct mail and billboard.  Advertising will support the Prior Service, Non-Prior Service, Health Profession Programs and Officer Programs.  Contractors will be required to develop advertising in selected media; process and track leads; and provide advertising guidance to Air Force Reserve Advertising for effectively communicating the attributes of military service to prospects and influencers.  The contractor will also be expected to provide other normal advertising services such as account management, billing, traffic control,  call center and research. The period of  performance for this contract may be up to ten years or more. We anticipate utilizing a basic and four options with some type of award term incentives.  The mobilization/orientation period is planned from 1 Jul 02 - 30 Sep 02.  The current contract type is a cost plus fixed fee.  We are looking at a new approach for this competition and would like industries' ideas/suggestions.  Commercial Services is one area:  How are your current commercial/federal contracts structured?  Do you see an avenue, considering the definition of a commercial item (FAR 2), to solicit this requirement under FAR 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items)?  Since we do not know whether we are going FAR 12 or FAR 15, request you submit your suggestions on criteria you would like to see tied to an Award Term type contract.  After reviewing the attached Performance Work Statement, which areas do you feel could be Firm Fixed Price?  We are striving for a Firm Fixed Price contract with reimbursable line item(s).  An IDIQ with task ordering is a possibility.  Request you provide your ideas/suggestions via email to the below address.  Offerors must furnish evidence of previous successful management and execution of other national personnel recruiting advertising programs.  The NAICS code is 541810 and the size standard is $6 million in annual revenue.  Contractors are asked to submit capability statements expressing interest and intent.  The data should include point of contact, business size, common commercial practices,  past performance information similar in scope to this initiative, references with phone numbers and any other pertinent corporate information.  At this time, offerors are requested to provide only contract numbers and points of contact for your past performance.  The data will be used as part of the market research to determine if this acquisition should be set-aside for small businesses or proceed in an unrestricted manner. Small businesses and teaming arrangements are encouraged.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is mandatory.  It is anticipated that offerors will be evaluated using a Technically Acceptable Price/Performance Trade-off (TAPPT) and anticipate requesting technical proposals and oral presentations.   The Government intends to issue a Pre-solicitation notice approximately 15 Mar 02.  Potential offerors should respond in writing by 4 Mar 2002.  Please send information to:  HQ AFRC/LGCP, ATTENTION:  Debbie Scarborough, 255 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA  31098-1637;  FAX to (478) 327-2210; or email Debbie.Scarborough@afrc.af.mil.   The Request for Proposal (RFP) and all associated documents when issued will be posted on the Fedbizops Web page.  The internet address is:  https://www.fedbizops.gov.  SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  It is recommended that all interested offerors register for this solicitation number through Fedbizops to ensure they automatically receive all updated documents to this requirement as they are posted.

<DESC>INFRARED SENSOR STIMULATOR (IRSS) PRE-PLANNED PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT (P3I) SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) desires industry interface to gain information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Infrared Sensor Stimulator (IRSS) Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) program.  The primary sponsor for the IRSS P3I program is the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  The IRSS P3I is designed to support the Tri-service electro-optical (EO) sensors Test and Evaluation (T&E).  The Air Combat Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF), Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD is the Lead for Program Management.  The Electronic Combat Integrated Test (ECIT), Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is the Deputy Program Manager.  The U.S. Army STRICOM is the Technical Lead.

Presently, T&E organizations from each of the three services utilize resistive-array-based Infrared Scene Projectors (IRSP) for developmental testing of tactical IR sensors in the laboratory environment.  The IR resistive array consists of a packaged integrated circuit utilizing several hundred thousand micro-resistors (micro-emitters) which each emit individually controlled IR energy when a current is passed through them.  Combining the resistor array with a scene generator, drive electronics, and matching collimator optics provides an IRSP with the capability to project realistic IR scenes into the entrance aperture of a sensor under test that are dynamic, and radiometrically correct.  Consequently, the resistive array based IRSP has proven itself to be the most versatile, realistic, and cost effective means of testing IR sensors in the laboratory.

The state-of-the-art in IR scene projection is represented in IRSPs utilizing resistive arrays containing up to 672x544 pixels.  These devices are sufficient for testing many presently fielded sensor systems.  However, they do not provide the necessary resolution and field-of-view (FOV) coverage to adequately test advanced-sensors presently under development (i.e., Target Acquisition Sensors, Threat Warning Sensors, Directed IR Countermeasures Sensors, IR Search and Track Sensors, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Sensors, and Missile Seekers). Subsystem test laboratories, and installed systems test facilities, both need higher resolution IRSPs (up to 1024x2048 pixel format in the near term, with growth path to 2048x2048 pixel format) to cost effectively test the next generation of sensor systems in the confines of the laboratory, depot, chamber, hangar, and dock.

The IRSS P3I Project is a ?Follow-On? upgrade to complete the required performance capability requirements of the Full Operational Capability (FOC) IRSS system.  IRSS P3I will satisfy the requirements for Full Field of View (F-FOV) scene projection in the IR, middle to long wavelength IR spectrums.  It also addresses corresponding upgrades commensurate to the increased data throughput and computational requirements for the supporting simulation and rendering capabilities

Information is being requested at this time specifically on developed COTS, emerging technology and products on F-FOV Large Format Resistive-emitter Array (LFRA) having the following characteristics:

&#61623; Micro-resistive array for a scene projector with a large format configuration of 1024x1024 and 1024x2048 pixel formats with growth path to 2048x2048 pixel formats or larger.
&#61623; Technically sound design, approaches and processes to fabricate, package and cool the large format arrays.
&#61623; Continuous emission over the entire 3 to 12 micron spectral range.
&#61623; Emit dynamic and radiometrically accurate IR images of targets and battlefield/test environments that replicate scenes as presented to the sensors in real world scenarios.
&#61623; Technically sound design and approaches to perform projection at real time frame rates of up to 200 Hz.
&#61623; Windowing techniques at 400 Hz. frame rates or higher for applications that require lower resolution (e.g., 512x1024) stimulation.
&#61623; Emphasis on uniformity, pixel yield, and heat load.
&#61623; Form, fit and function that provide portability, mobility and reconfigurability needed to fully support installed system testing.
&#61623; The scene signal/imagery will be in digital format and transmitted to the LFRA via fiber.  It is preferred that digital to analog conversion of the signal be performed on or near the back-plane area of the LFRA.

The Tri-service IRSS P3I Integrated Product Team believes industry feedback is vitally important, and will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry. The government does not intend to pay for the requested information nor respond to submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  Please limit formal white paper submission to no more than 5 pages to include cover letter and white paper.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments that consist of pre-printed brochures and/or related commercial product literatures.  Please mail responses to: NAWCTSD, Code 2536, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or e-mail to Mr. Felix Marrero, Contract Specialist, at Felix_Marrero@stricom.army.mil and / or Mrs. Shirley Eaton, Contracting Officer, at Shirley_Eaton@stricom.army.mil.  Please provide responses no later than 1300 hours, 12 April 2002.

A substantial duplication of cost to the Gov ernment, which would not likely be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Corps requirements would likely result if Stantec did not provide the follow-on services.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotat ions.  The Government will consider responses received within 7 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is within the discretion of the Government.  Questions should be d irected to the Contract Specialist, Barbara Marshall at (916) 557-5178, fax (916) 557-5278 or email to barbara.a.marshall@usace.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>Very Shallow Water (VSW) Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) Notification of Second Industry Day
<DESC>POC: Jessica Maddox, Contract Specialist, Code 1143I, 301-744-6614; FAX 301-744-6670; e-mail maddoxjd@ih.navy.mil All interested contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day to be held on Wed., 12 Jun 02.  Specific location has not been determined but will be in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area. The purpose of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for pre-solicitation industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for the procurement of untethered, unmanned, underwater Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems that will support Search-Classify-Map (S-C-M) missions in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) zone (10 - 40 feet sea water (FSW)) and aid in refinement of the system performance requirements. The S-C-M mission will entail systematically reconnoitering through predetermined geographic areas (notional 500 yd X 1000 yd) in the VSW zone and precisely mapping the b ottom contour while providing for the classification of objects that exhibit mine-like characteristics.  The system must be lightweight, two-person portable with a small shipboard footprint and able to be deployed/recovered from a small inflatable craft.  The vehicle will need to possess mobile ingress/egress capabilities to enable it to move from a launch point of up to 5 NM from the S-C-M area and return to a point at least 5 NM from the operational area. While the system is primarily intended to search the VSW zone (10-40 FSW), it must be capable of performing mapping and object classification in water depths up to 60 FSW. Data recorded by the vehicle must be transferable to compatible Navy tactical displays and information systems to facilitate the re-acquisition of targets during subsequent missions. The production contract shall encompass hardware systems and technical/lo gistic support documentation. This Industry Day, the second Industry Day for this effort, is planned to finalize the UUV performance and technical/logistic support documentation requirements followed by the issuing of a Production Contract Request for Proposal (RFP) in mid-October 2002.  The quantity of hardware systems envisioned to be procured under the contract is between 5 and 12 systems (each system consisting of two to three vehicles plus all auxiliary equipment and software required to operate the vehicles. Approximately one month prior to the Industry Day, the following read ahead documents will be posted on the NAVSEA Indian Head World Wide Web site at "www.ih.navy.mil/contracts/" for downloading by any interested contractor: 1) Industry Day specific location/directions and Agenda; 2) Draft System Performance Specification (including required environmental testing); 3 ) Draft Statement of Work (SOW); 4) Draft Evaluation Criteria (Contract Sections L & M input); and 5) Draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). Industry involvement in the VSW MCM UUV acquisition effort was initiated in Dec 1999 when BAA00-002 was issued by Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center.  Similar to the early involvement of industry in the acquisition effort, early Fleet involvement is also being pursued.  Two limited-scope demonstration events were conducted during 2000 as a result of responses to BAA00-002 resulting in the procurement of a User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) in 2001.  The UOES is being  evaluated in the operational mission environment by the VSW MCM Detachment UUV Platoon through the end of 2002.  The purpose of the Fleet evaluation is to refine the system/mission requirements and develop applicable concepts of operation and ta ctics to be employed in the VSW MCM environment.  The information gained from this evaluation is  feeding into the production contracting effort along with industry input obtained during the two Industry Days. The contracting approach will involve the issue of a RFP, proposal submission by all interested vendors, and a two-phased selection process leading to contract award.  Phase I will consist of the desktop evaluation and ranking of all the paper proposals received in accordance with the RFP.  The highly qualified vendors are selected for Phase II. Phase II involves the table-top evaluation of sample prototype hardware and technical/logistic documentation and analysis of the proposed cost.  The vendors are ranked and one or more are awarded a contract to provide a hardware prototype that meets the Performance Specification and the associated Technical/Logistic Documentation .  This contract also has an option for Production Systems.  The first phase of the contract involves delivery of the prototype and documentation followed by Requirements Compliance Testing (RCT) of the prototype hardware (one system consisting of one vehicle and ancillary hardware/software) and evaluation of the technical/logistic documentation.  Technical experts in the laboratory and Fleet personnel in the operational environment will conduct the RCT.  The vendor(s) will be ranked and the one with the highest overall ranking will be awarded the option for production. Attendance at the Industry Day is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting a proposal.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Seating is limited. Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attende es register for the Industry Day by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, Address, Telephone Number, and e-mail address not later than 1 June 2002. Registration data must be FAXed or e-mailed to the POC identified above.  Registered attendees will be notified by e-mail when the read ahead information is posted on the web site.  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Day or the read-ahead documentation may be FAXed or e-mailed to the POC. The questions will be addressed at Industry Day unless requested otherwise by the submitter.  The purpose of this Industry Day is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer pre-solicitation industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and exp ense of the industry participants involved. For questions please contact Jessica Maddox, Contract Specialist, at telephone number 301-744-6614, FAX 301-744-6670, e-mail maddoxjd@ih.navy.mil.
