<DESC>The Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) DHS plans on awarding a non-competitive contract to Microsoft Consulting for one-year to obtain “blue badge” consulting services for support and programming of the servers that support eh Automated Targeting Systems (ATS).    The ATS is a major software component within the CBP which provides the following support:  ATS - AT (Anti-Terrorism)- supports CBP’s mandate to develop a system able to target high-risk inbound and outbound shipments aboard passenger aircraft; ATS-P (Passenger)- supports CBP’s mandate to target suspects for transactional crimes, including narcotics trafficking and money laundering; and ATS-N (Narcotics)- supports CBP’s mandate to perform high speed- automated review and analysis of shipment data, and ranking shipments by level of suspicion of illegal narcotics activity.  A critical component of the ATS system is the ATS server, which has experienced software stability problems in the past.  The consultants serve as technical advisors and architects helping architect plans and design and implement solutions leveraging Microsoft products, tools and technologies. Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) consultants work with ATS on specific projects and strategic initiatives in support of the DHS mission.  Microsoft has direct access and interface to the MS products group/ entire MS window suite.  Microsoft is the only vendor that can provide qualified personnel (i.e., blue bade personnel) with expert knowledge transfer, programming best practices advice and architectural guidance regarding development of the ATS4 Architecture designed to utilize Microsoft’s .NET framework.  Specifically, Microsoft personnel are required to:  advice and assist in designing and deploying a Web service to expose the ATS data to non-ATS applications (e.g., Microsoft Office); advise and assist ATS developers in establishing connection pooling within the ATS application; advise and assist with knowledge transfer, architectural guidance and planning support to assist ATS developers in the redesign to be enabled within the .Net framework to migrate ATS to the .Net architecture.  Microsoft personnel have access to proprietary information exclusively available within Microsoft such as internal product support knowledge bases and proprietary architectural and technical information not available within to the public or third party (Microsoft Certified Software Engineer-MCSEs).  Additionally, Microsoft personnel have access into internal development teams within Microsoft.  Having access to the personnel within Microsoft who wrote the code behind Microsoft’s applications is often not only essential but often the only way to resolve complex programming and support issues quickly.  Given the state-of-the-art technology being employed in developing the ATS, having ability to obtain such high-level information, normally available only to Microsoft employees, is considered essential to CBP’s ability to quicdkly develop and deploy applications that have a high degree of reliability.  For these reasons, Microsoft is considered uniquely qualified to perform the work/services and has been selected for contract award.  See Note 22.

EIS has developed and maintained the configuration mapping and mission assignments for the IVSR system in support of all OT Test Cases.   EIS, Inc. has been instrumental in the development of the Operational Utilization Demonstration test cases that will be utilized  to conduct the Air Traffic evaluation the IVSR OT and has extensive knowledge regarding ATC functionality which has been proven to be extremely valuable in the development of the ATC scenarios. EIS, Inc. also has unique knowledge regarding the operation of the IVSR Traffic Load Generator that will be utilized throughout the Operational Test peirod and subsequent software baseline testing.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source modification to AT&T Corp., 2020 K Street, Washington, DC 20006.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of work performed under contract DCA200-97-D-0048 that was competitively awarded to AT&T on 28 January 1997.  The contract is currently due to expire on 27 July 2006.   The proposed modification provides a 3-month extension of services, plus one 3-month option period.  The contract provides common-user dedicated transmission service within the Continental United States (CONUS), between various DOD base/post/camps via the DS/BMS - C bandwidth managers and SONET backbone.  Some transmission services are used to provide connectivity for DOD dedicated networks, e.g., JWICS, SIPRNET, NIPRNET, and DSN.  Transmission services include providing the transport of voice, data, video, imagery and other information between Government specified Bandwidth Manager points; and providing SONET-based capabilities between DISN Bandwidth Managers and providing access transport from specified service delivery points (SDPs) to DISN Bandwidth Managers.  Required transmission services include, but are not limited to:  T1, T3, OC3, OC12, and OC48.  This proposed contract action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow rapid extension to deployed military forces anywhere in the world.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  The services under this contract are currently being transitioned to the DTS-C Access Optimization (A/O) contract.  It is estimated 1,000 circuits and 100 backbone and bridge trunks will not be cutover by the end of July due to delays in getting the infrastructure in place. The DTS-C A/O contract is a bridge contract to provide continued support until the services can be moved to the follow-on competed replacement DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract.  The anticipated award date for the DATS contract is fourth quarter FY2006.  AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>:   The Department of Energyâ€™s Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center (EMCBC) intends to contract by means other than full and open competition a 90 day time and materials purchase order with Sapere Consulting, Inc.103 East Main Street, Suite 201, Walla Walla, WA  99362 for contractor services and deliverables through performance of technical support to the Oakland Projects Office (OPO). The contractor will be providing support for the closure of OPOâ€™s projects at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) site. The contractor will be responsible for providing assistance in identifying and managing the cost and schedule risk to the completion of the projects at the facilities. Technical support on this project includes development of the Critical Decision packages and baseline development support. Also included is the technical facilitation to gain consensus on issues and key decisions associated with strategic planning. The Department of Energy intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR 6.302-1. and 41 USC 253(c)(1). This section provides that when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. In this case, the department has been receiving these services from Sapere over the last year via an existing subcontract that will expire on Feb. 2007. The department will be conducting a full and open competition for a prime contract to provide these services over the next four years. In order to avoid cost and schedule impacts to the OPO projects receiving support from Sapere that would result from a break in the services, the department requires the temporary continuation of these services for the next 90 days or until the new contract is awarded whichever comes first. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why they should be considered, as described above. All interested firms must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), August 1, 2006, to Angela Cooney, EMCBC 250 East 5th Street Suite 500 Cincinnati, Ohio 45202. Email: angela.cooney@emcbc.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE. Requests for solicitation will not be honored. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.

OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot 
be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Panama City, Florida intends to procure seafloor habitat delineation services potentially in the U.S. South Atlantic between Cape Hatteras, NC and the Florida Keys; the Gulf of Mexico between Brownsville, TX and the Florida Keys; and the U.S. Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands).  The depths will range between 40 and 250m, but will be concentrated between 70 and 120m.  

NOAA Fisheries is tasked with providing information on fish and invertebrate species as well as critical habitat to federal management entities including Fishery Management Councils (FMCs).  In the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. South Atlantic, many of the areas containing the species and habitat of interest lie in deep water at the edge of the continental shelf.  The depths preclude in situ observations, thus Fisheries must rely upon remote sensing technologies.  In the U.S. South Atlantic alone, there are needs to survey ~1000 sq nautical miles of shelf edge habitat between north Florida and North Carolina.  The contract will be for the collection and processing of multibeam bathymetric and acoustic backscatter data at depths identified herein.  The Contractor shall provide all items necessary to perform the services described herein, which shall include but are not limited to: a suitable vessel platform, equipment, tools, supplies, hardware, software, labor, professional expertise, travel expenses for personnel, etc.    The Contractor’s survey equipment must be matched to the depth range in order to provide the highest possible resolution.  A depth range and coordinates will be provided for specific Task Orders.  Deliverables under this contract may include:  Raw data files in either *.all format or .*xtf format, for acoustic seabed classification with QTC multiview; XYZ and XYA data corrected for heave, pitch roll, yaw and tides; ArcInfo GRID of bathymetry and backscatter to be imported into ArcGIS 9.1; Geotiff images of bathymetry and backscatter; and complete metadata.  Additional related requirements may be included in subsequent Task Orders.  Data must be delivered in DVD format.

The Government intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract (s) under FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR 15 (Contracting By Negotiation) with each contract having a term of 5 years.  Each contract shall have a minimum value of $100,000.  The IDIQ will identify base rates to be charged for performing seafloor habitat delineation services as projects and funding become available for which Task Orders will be issued.    

This is a full and open competition solicitation.  The Government plans to post a solicitation on or about June 12, 2006 with proposals due approximately 20 calendar days thereafter.  The NAICS code is 541360 and the small business size standard is a maximum $4.5M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>The government intends to issue an unrestricted Firm Fixed Price request for quotes (RFQ) for services (including labor) and materials for the installation of a complete fire suppression system into three separate computer rooms. The fire suppression system will be in support of data facilities with Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) installed with existing fire alarm indicators. There will need to be site surveys conducted. 

The approximate sizes of the three rooms by volume are as follows: 3696 ft3, 4054 ft3 and 1200 ft3, respectively. Systems shall use the Brand name Fenwal FM – 200 suppression systems, manufactured by Fenwal Protection Systems, 400 Main Street, Ashland, MA 01721 or an equal product/agent to negate hazards and facility restrictions of Halon and provide suppression without damaging APDE. The system should be able to tie into existing fire alarm for indicators only and incorporate both visual and audible alarms. Systems should be equipped to shut down HVAC systems to each of the three rooms. 

Systems should use multiple types of sensors such as heat, particulate and smoke etc., and require detection of more than one before beginning discharge countdown. The systems should afford the opportunity to prevent discharge of the fire suppression agent after detection/countdown. Systems should also include complete drawing packages and an option for an annual maintenance contract. Said maintenance contract should incorporate design, installation and testing costs. All designs must be approved by base installation Fire Marshall prior to providing any proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Cost-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide modeling, simulation, and testing for EA-6B aircraft hydraulic systems.  The vendor will model and simulate the combined and flight hydraulic system operation specific to A-6 TMS utilizing the unique A-6E test bed.  Modeling and simulation is to include hydraulic operation of the main and nose landing gear and primary and secondary flight controls systems.  

NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), 1 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623-5603.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is driven by RIT’s on-site possession of an old A-6E aircraft, on which the majority of the hydraulic testing and structural analysis will be performed.  This aircraft will be able to operationally simulate the EA-6B for most systems, thereby significantly minimizing the cost and time for development and iterative testing.  

It is anticipated that the SIC Code for this requirement will be 8734 (Testing Laboratories), the NAICS code will be 541380 (Testing Laboratories), and the FSC code will be H216 (Equipment and Materials Testing for Aircraft Components and Accessories).  

The estimated period of performance is a base period of one year, with a potential for two one-year option periods.  Numbered note 22 applies.  Other interested parties may submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform the services listed above if they believe they possess the required knowledge and ability to perform this requirement.  These responses may be submitted via email to candice.anderson@navy.mil or may be faxed to (301) 757-6516, Attn: Candice Anderson, Code 2.5.1.8.1.7.  Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted.  

Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH THE PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCIENCE CENTER FOR NOAA FISHERIES, ALASKA REGION.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SERVICES TO MONITOR THE EFFICACY OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS AS A FISH HABITAT ENHANCEMENT TOOL IN NEARSHORE ALASKAN WATERS.  THE CONTRACTOR’S SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO:  THE OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES OF THE MONITORING STUDY ARE: 1.)  DOCUMENT THE MARINE COMMUNITY AT THE ARTIFICIAL REEF AND A.) DESCRIBE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY THE PLANT AND INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES COLONIZING THE REEF; B) DOCUMENT FISH SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE; C) DETERMINE IF MARINE COMMUNITIES VARY BY REEF STRUCTURE (BALL VS. PYRAMID); C1) DETERMINE IF ARTIFICIAL REEF COMMUNITIES ENHANCE THE IMMEDIATE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND;  C2) ASSESS ARTIFICIAL REEFS AS A FISH HABITAT ENHANCEMENT AND RESTORATION TOOL.  IN ADDRESSING THESE OBJECTIVES, TWO HYPOTHESES ARE TO BE TESTED BY THE CONTRACTOR:
H1. FISH HABITAT IS ENHANCED AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS; FISH DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE AT ARTIFICIAL REEF SITES IS INCREASED IN COMPARISON TO NATURAL HARD BOTTOM HABITAT.
H2. ARTIFICIAL REEFS MIMIC THE ECOLOGICAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF NATURAL REEFS SUCH AS ROCK OUTCROPPINGS.
METHODS/SAMPLING DESIGN:  SAMPLING METHODOLOGIES STEM FROM PREVIOUS WORK ON ARTIFICIAL REEFS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES (CONLEY ET. AL. 2000, SEAMAN 2000).  CONTRACTOR WILL CONDUCT INTENSIVE MONITORING, AT A MINIMUM OF 5 DAYS/MONTH, FROM MAY 2007 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2007 TO EFFECTIVELY DESCRIBE COLONIZATION RATES OF SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION, SESSILE AND MOTILE INVERTEBRATES, AND FISH.  MONTHLY SURVEYS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE CONTRACTOR USING A COMBINATION OF SURVEY METHODS.  MONTHLY SCUBA AND STATIONARY UNDERWATER CAMERA SURVEYS WILL DESCRIBE PLANT AND INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES AND WILL DOCUMENT FISH SPECIES.  FOR EACH SITE, CONTRACTOR TO PERFORM MONTHLY SCUBA SURVEYS, INCLUDING A MINIMUM OF 16 SLATE OBSERVATION AND VIDEO TRANSECTS. PHOTOGRAPHIC QUADRANTS WILL BE TAKEN AT A MINIMUM OF 16 SITES (3 PHOTOS PER SITE).  HOOK AND LINE SURVEYS, TO ASSESS PREDATOR ASSEMBLAGES, WILL BE CONDUCTED AT A MINIMUM OF 19 SITES (6 ARTIFICIAL REEF, 9 NATURAL HARD BOTTOM, 4 NATURAL REEF) AND EACH SURVEY IS FOR TWO ANGLERS FISHING A 20 MINUTE PERIOD.  FISH TRAPS WILL BE DEPLOYED MONTHLY TO COLLECT DEMERSAL FISH, AND GUT CONTENTS WILL BE COLLECTED TO DETERMINE FORAGE BASE, AT THE SAME 19 SITES AS THE HOOK & LINE SURVEYS WITH 3 TRAPS DEPLOYED PER SITE FOR A SIX HOUR SOAK.    DROP CAMERA SURVEYS AT SAME 19 SITES AS ABOVE (HOOK & LINE, AND FISH TRAP SAMPLING SITES) WILL BE COMPLETED, WITH A 5 MINUTE SURVEY AT SITE BASE AND 5 MINUTES ABOVE SITE (10 MINUTES TOTAL PER SITE).  IN ADDITION, THREE NATURAL ROCKY REEFS AND THREE NATURAL HARD BOTTOM HABITATS NEAR WHITTIER WILL BE MONITORED AS CONTROL SITES.  SAMPLING FREQUENCIES LISTED ABOVE ARE A MINIMUM MORE SAMPLES MAY BE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE STUDY OBJECTIVES ARE MET.   SAMPLING EFFORT SHOULD MEET THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES.  SAMPLING PROTOCOLS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:  DIVE SURVEYS: SLATE OBSERVATIONS:  FISH AND INVERTEBRATE SPECIES ARE RECORDED ON HAND HELD SLATES BY THE DIVERS AT THE TIME OF OBSERVATION.  UNDERWATER VIDEO TRANSECTS:  AT EACH REEF PLOT WITHIN BOTH REEF PATCHES, DIVERS WILL SWIM ONE 30M VIDEO TRANSECT AROUND CIRCUMFERENCE OF PLOT, AND ONE 10M TRANSECT OVER THE REEF PLOT.  VIDEO TRANSECTS WILL BE SIMILARLY CONDUCTED AT ROCKY REEF SITES AND AT NATURAL HARD BOTTOM CONTROL SITES.  VIDEO WILL INCORPORATE 1M ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TRANSECT LINE. OBJECTS SEEN OUTSIDE OF THE 1M LIMIT WILL NOT BE RECORDED.  PHOTOGRAPHIC QUADRATS:  AT EACH REEF PATCH (REEF BALL AND FISH HAVENS) DIGITAL STILL PHOTOS WILL BE TAKEN OF PLANT AND INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES AT THREE RANDOMLY CHOSEN REEF STRUCTURES IN EACH PLOT (LOW, MID, AND HIGH DEPTH PLOTS).  AT EACH STRUCTURE, TWO 0.1M2 QUADRAT PHOTOS WILL BE TAKEN AT BOTH THE BASE AND THE CREST.  QUADRAT PHOTOS WILL BE OVERLAID WITH A GRID TO DETERMINE PERCENT COVERAGE OF COLONIZING ORGANISMS.  IF PHOTOGRAPH RESOLUTION IS INSUFFICIENT FOR POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION, SCRAPINGS OF COLONIZING PLANTS AND INVERTEBRATES MAY ALSO BE COLLECTED WITHIN 0.0625M2 QUADRATS.  PHOTOGRAPHIC QUADRATS WILL BE SIMILARLY CONDUCTED AT ROCKY REEF SITES AND AT THREE NATURAL HARD BOTTOM CONTROL SITES.  PHYSICAL MONITORING:  FOR EACH SURVEY METHOD, SALINITY, TIDAL STAGE, VISIBILITY, WATER AND AIR TEMPERATURE, AND CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL BE RECORDED.  NON-DIVE SURVEYS: HOOK AND LINE SURVEYS:  ALL FISH TRAP SITES WILL BE FISHED FOR 20 MINUTES BY TWO ANGLERS USING BOTTOM FISHING TACKLE TO ASSESS PREDATOR ASSEMBLAGES AT REEF SITES.  ALL FISH CAUGHT WILL BE MEASURED AND A SUB SAMPLE COLLECTED FOR GUT CONTENT ANALYSIS.  FISH TRAP DEPLOYMENT:  AT EACH REEF PATCH (REEF BALLS AND FISH HAVENS) 3 FISH TRAPS WILL BE DEPLOYED FOR 6 HOURS AT EACH PLOT (LOW, MID, AND HIGH DEPTH PLOTS).  FISH CAUGHT AT EACH TRAP WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND MEASURED, AND A SUB SAMPLE COLLECTED FOR GUT CONTENT ANALYSIS.  FISH TRAPS WILL BE SIMILARLY DEPLOYED AT THREE NATURAL HARD BOTTOM CONTROL SITES AND AT LEAST ONE NATURAL ROCKY REEF SITE.  DROP CAMERA SURVEYS/STATIONARY VIDEO CAMERA:  PRIOR TO FISH TRAP DEPLOYMENT, ALL FISH TRAP SITES WILL BE MONITORED BY TETHERED VIDEO CAMERA (NON-DIVE VIDEO).  THE CAMERA WILL RECORD VIDEO FOR FIVE MINUTES AT BOTH THE BASE OF EACH PLOT AND AT A HEIGHT OF 2M ABOVE EACH PLOT.  SPECIES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND MEASUREMENT APPROXIMATED BY LASER REFERENCE MOUNTED TO CAMERA.  PHYSICAL MONITORING:  FOR EACH SURVEY METHOD, SALINITY, TIDAL STAGE, WATER AND AIR TEMPERATURE, AND CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL BE RECORDED.  ADDITIONALLY, A SEA-BIRD ELECTRONICS CTD (CONDUCTIVITY, TEMPERATURE, AND DEPTH) PROFILER MUST BE DEPLOYED TO ANALYZE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WATER COLUMN.   THE CONTRACTOR FOR THIS PROJECT MUST HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE WORKING AND MONITORING ARTIFICIAL REEFS (AR), EXPERTISE IN SCIENTIFIC DIVING, DATA COLLECTION UNDERWATER IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS, PROVEN EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN A TWO YEAR STUDY AND TO ANALYZE RESULTS YIELDING PRODUCTS SUCH AS SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST ACHIEVE ALL OF THE ABOVE IN A REMOTE AREA OF ALASKA AND BE PROFICIENT AT THE LOGISTICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY WORKING IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IN WHITTIER, ALASKA.  PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCIENCE CENTER (PWSSC).IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED AS MR. BRAD REYNOLDS AND DR. MARY ANNE BISHOP, OF PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCIENCE CENTER (PWSSC) MEET THE STANDARDS LISTED ABOVE. MR. BRAD REYNOLDS IS THE ONLY KNOWN PERSON TO HAVE CONDUCTED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH DIVES ON THE ARTIFICIAL REEFS (AR) IN PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND (PWS).  DR. BISHOP PROVIDED SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE.  PWSSC PROVIDED TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT.  BOTH THESE RESEARCHERS, WORKING THROUGH THE PWSSC, COLLECTED AND ANALYZED DATA ON THE NMFS DEPLOYED AR IN SMITTY’S COVE, PASSAGE CANAL, IN PWS IN 2006, AS PART OF MR. REYNOLDS MASTER’S THESIS.  MR. REYNOLDS HAS OVER 40 DIVES COLLECTING SCIENTIFIC DATA ON ARS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND TWO YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING ON JUVENILE FISH HABITAT SURVEYS IN PWS.  DR. BISHOP HAS PUBLISHED OVER 25 ARTICLES IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS.  THE WORK AND DATA PRODUCED BY PWSSC IS OF HIGH QUALITY AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.  FURTHER, MR. REYNOLDS AND DR. BISHOP ARE PROFESSIONALS, REQUIRING LITTLE SUPERVISION, AND HAVE ESTABLISHED A GOOD, PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH NOAA FISHERIES, ALASKA REGION/ANCHORAGE FIELD OFFICE.  THEIR EXPERIENCE MEETS THE NEEDS OF NOAA FISHERIES HABITAT CONSERVATION DIVISION.  IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF NOAA FISHERIES TO STAY WITH PWSSC DURING THE TRANSITION FROM YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2 OF THE STUDY.  STAYING WITH PWSSC FACILITATES OUR NEED TO MAINTAIN HIGH DATA QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY IN STUDY DESIGN.  CHANGING CONTRACTORS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND RESULT IN A LOWER QUALITY PRODUCT FOR NOAA FISHERIES.  DATA QUALITY WOULD BE COMPROMISED TO THE POINT OF MAKING PROJECT RESULTS NOT WORTHY OF PUBLICATION.  COST EFFICIENCY WOULD ALSO BE INCREASED AS HIRING NEW CONTRACTORS WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN DESIGN AND EQUIPMENT ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF PWSSC. THE PWSSC HAS ACCESS TO DIVERS WHO ARE AAUS CERTIFIED. CURRENTLY AAUS HAS A RECIPROCITY AGREEMENT WITH NOAA.  DUE TO THIS RECIPROCITY NOAA DIVERS ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM WORKING DIVES WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE TRAINING FOR THIS LEVEL OF DIVE PROFICIENCY IS RIGOROUS AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND DIVERS THAT HAVE THIS LEVEL OF CERTIFICATION. WITHOUT RECIPROCITY NOAA DIVERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE FELLOW RESEARCHER MAKING DATA COLLECTION IMPOSSIBLE.  BASED ON THE ABOVE, NOAA BELIEVES PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCIENCE CENTER. IS THE ONLY VENDOR AVAILABLE THAT CAN MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS AND IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL PROJECT.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008. THIS IS A TWO YEAR PROJECT.  PRINCIPAL PLACE OF PERFORMANCE IS SMITTY’S COVE NEAR WHITTIER, ALASKA.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOVERNMENTS INTENT TO NEGOTIATE THIS REQUIREMENT WITH PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCIENCE CENTER., UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 41 USC253(C)(1), ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE WHICH, IF TIMELY RECEIVED, WILL BE EVALUATED BY NOAA TO DETERMINE IF A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION SHOULD BE ISSUED.  RESPONSES MUST BE RECEIVED BY AUGUST 11, 2006. RESPONSES MAY BE FAXED TO (907) 586-8726 OR E-MAILED TO SUZANNE.JOHNSTON@NOAA.GOV.  QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS PROPOSED ACQUISITION MAY BE DIRECTED TO SUZANNE JOHNSTON.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL AWARD VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters (HQS) has a requirement for Congressional Briefing Conference Training for NASA employees, including members of the NASA Leadership Development and Executive Service Candidate Development Programs.    NASA HQS intends to acquire these services from The Government Affairs Institute (GAI) at Georgetown University.	GAI has highly qualified instructors, many with PhDs and personal legislative connections and experience, and an unmatched depth of knowledge about NASA's goals, issues and challenges.  Their existing proven programs provided to NASA participants are not general legislative overviews but targeted, focused learning experiences that provide NASA managers and leaders with a unique understanding of how to enable the Agency to meet Congressional requirements, while achieving the NASA mission. The GAI course is able to accomplish this due to GAI's longstanding working relationship and history with NASA and their consistent focus on learning about NASA challenges and needs over this period of time.  Their experience with NASA past participants provides them a detailed understanding of the cultural, managerial and technical intricacies of NASA and has allowed them to weave together a powerful and tailored program, which addresses NASA needs.  The course is the result of approximately ten years of effort and incurred cost to define and refine a course that is meaningful and specific to NASA.   This effort has allowed GAI to modify/tailor their course and place content within the course that specifically relates to NASA’s operations on Capitol Hill. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 11, 2006.

<DESC>The Nacimiento Copper Mine Site Operable Unit 2 is located in Sandoval County, 3.5 miles southeast of Cuba in northwest New Mexico on State Highway 126.  In the 1980s, over 250,000 gallons of sulfuric and ferric acid was injected into the Agua Zarca aquifer to extract cooper. The acid was left in place resulting in the average pH of 3.59 and heavy metals above New Mexico State standards. This remedial action will pump contaminated ground water from the aquifer, surface treat it and release it into an unnamed channel. 

The project will pump up to 120 gallons per minute of groundwater via a series of new extraction wells to the surface.  This water shall be treated using a semi-passive alcohol-enhanced bioreactor system (SPAEBS).  The SPAEBS will utilize biological cultures to remove metals to the more stringent of New Mexico applicable groundwater and surface water standards.  The treated water shall be discharged through an engineered drainage channel armored with riprap to prevent erosion and sediment transport and to provide aeration to surface water drainage.  The main components of the required system are as follows:

GROUND WATER EXTRACTION SYSTEM
„X	Nine extraction wells 
„X	One new monitoring well
„X	Two 3,000 gallon above ground storage tanks
„X	Supply pumps
„X	Level control alarm system
„X	Piping from the extraction wells to the storage tanks and to the SPAEBS
„X	Supply pumps
SPAEBS
„X	Sodium hydroxide feed system, including 3,000 gallon tank and two metering pumps
„X	Lined settling pond, 15 feet deep - 140 long and 100 feet wide
„X	Ethanol feed system, including 3,000 gallon tank 
„X	Nitrogen feed shed
„X	Lined bioreactor - 15 feet deep, 70 feet long and 200 feet wide
„X	Recycle loop, including piping and recycle pump
„X	Chemical supply alarm system
EFFLUENT DISCHARGE SYSTEM
„X	Discharge pipe
„X	Limestone lined discharge channel

The operation and maintenance of this system for one year, with three option years is included.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for provision of Digital Line-of-Sight (DLOS) connectivity for Multinational Task Force Headquarters in Kosovo.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee (IC). 

The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA procedure with the additional opportunity for the nomination of bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 350,000 Euros ($446,000 USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-11919-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Connectivity for Multinational Task Force Headquarters will be provided by two communication hubs that will contain BME and PABX equipment. Digital Line-of-Sight (DLOS) will be used as the primary means of communication. The DLOS connectivity will be based on existing NATO-owned equipment, which will be upgraded to ensure required link capacity. 

All work will take place in Kosovo. All DLOS equipment provided will be required to be from the same brand in order to be centrally managed and maintained in the future.

The following is a summary description of the project requirements:

1. Relocation of existing DLOS IDU to new building in KFOR HQ and at Mount Goles.

2. Provision and installation of 2 4+1 E1 links (2 ends each):
A - Lipjan - Pristina Hill
B - Pec (Villagio Italia) - Pec Hill
	
Both are direct view links and tower or mast are to be installed at each end.

3. Upgrade of 3 Alcatel 9400 UX family existing links:
A - Pec Hill - Goles from 4 EI to 16+1 E1
B - Goles - KFOR HQ from 4 E1 to 16+1 E1
C - Pristina Hill - KFOR HQ from 4 E1 to 16+1E1

Capacity and software upgrade to the last current version of existing equipment are required.

4. Provision, installation, configuration of E1 Routing or Switching equipment on 4 sites.
A - Pristina Hill
B - Pec Hill
C - Goles
D - KFOR HQ

5. Provision of a light central management solution including hardware for all provided and upgraded equipment (DLOS, E1 Router or Switch).

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO RESTRICTED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET.  

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be nominated with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 11 August 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: August 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: 3rd Quarter of 200

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Acquisition of PALM Microbeam C Laser Microdissection Microscope

Purpose/Brief History:

The EIB Microscopy Facility requires a laser microdissection microscope (LMD) to satisfy the demands of research projects conducted by EIB members. A laser microdissection microscope provides the ability to capture specific regions from a sample for further biochemical analysis.  It also provides the ability to perform microirradiation experiments on living samples where information on in situ biochemical context is necessary.  The Carl Zeiss MicroImaging LMD is designed on an inverted microscope configuration and one of the main uses of the LMD here in the EIB will be examining live cells, which requires an inverted microscope configuration to be performed reliably and efficiently.  The Carl Zeiss LMD is the only microscope that provides the capabilities that are required by the EIB investigators.  In addition it is compatible with the numerous existing microscope components that are already in the EIB Microscopy Facility.
The Palm Microbeam C has the following features that are required for the EIB’s research:

1)	The LMD provides a non-contact method for cutting and capture which maintains sterility of the sample.
2)	Laser pressure catapulting technology used to transport captured sample into collection tube.  
3)	LMD configuration is based on an inverted microscope platform which is ideal for live cell work.  
4)	PlasDIC enhanced optical contrast method for plastic dishes or membrane slides, the two primary substrates to be used in preparing samples.  
5)	High resolution cutting below 1 micrometer for capture of single chromosomes from metaphase spreads.
6)	Advanced image analysis and archiving suite for automatic object recognition and analysis.  The Zeiss software is compatible with software currently run on our existing microscopes.
7)	Capable of cutting and capturing archival samples prepared on glass rather than polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane.  
8)	Live cell microirradiation in a sterile environment.  

The configuration of the Zeiss PALM LMD includes a fluorescence imaging components providing the ability to excite and monitor Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged proteins in living cells before, during, and after laser microirradiation and microdissection.  This method will provide the EIB with new and novel tools to apply to their research projects.  The Zeiss PALM LMD system has the unique ability to accommodate complex live cell imaging experiments while also performing standard laser microdissection procedures consistently. 


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The EIB’s existing microscopes do not provide the laser microirradiation and microdissection capabilities provided by the Zeiss PALM LMD.  Introduction of DNA breaks in living cells requires an inverted microscope configuration that is provided only by Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc.  Without this configuration we would be severely hindered in studying the mechanisms of DNA repair in living cells.  In addition, the Zeiss PALM LMD software platform is consistent with that used on our existing Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope, thereby allowing the PALM LMD to integrate into our facility with minimal retraining effort and providing ease of operation that is critical for EIB members to obtain fully reproducible data from one day to the next.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, No-7489, Trondheim, Norway to investigate hormonal exposures that occur during pregnancy and subsequent breast cancer risk of the mother. The EBP has a primary involvement in research addressing pregnancy and other hormonal factors pertinent to cancer. EBP is pursuing a research program on the hormonal etiology of breast cancer including investigating the biological mechanisms that are hypothesized to mediate the effects of identified epidemiologic risk factors such as pregnancy.  NCI would like to extend this research by establishing studies to directly analyze the association of pregnancy biomarkers and cancer risk.  Exposures that occur during pregnancy have profound consequences for the subsequent breast cancer risk of the mother. Despite the long-term beneficial effects of an early age at first birth and high parity, risk is actually elevated within the first 5-15 years following pregnancy. Tumors that occur during this period tend to be hormone-receptor negative and late stage, to progress quickly and to have a poor prognosis.  A large cohort of pregnant women from whom blood samples are available exists in Norway with the capability of being linked to the cancer and vital status registries.  Dr. Vatten at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology will access data from a unique cohort of pregnant women in Norway in which multiple pregnancy blood samples were collected from 35,000 women to investigate the associations of several steroid hormones and growth factors with the transient increase in breast cancer after pregnancy. Breast cancer cases occurring within 15 years following pregnancy will be identified by linking the cohort with the Norwegian National Cancer Registry. Hormones and other growth factors will be compared between cases and an appropriate control group of women who did not develop breast cancer.  Information on other pregnancy factors will be obtained from linking the cohort to the Norwegian National Medical Birth Registry.  The Norwegian University of Science and Technology is the only vendor known to the NCI Researcher that has a recognized expert in the area of hormonal carcinogenesis research, has access to a large cohort (30,000 women or larger) of pregnant women with at least two blood samples collected during the pregnancy, and has the ability to link these women to a national cancer registry. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 11, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government intends to procure bracket and alignment (B&A) procedures using a 5 year, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract with a maximum dollar value of $6,500,000.00.  B&A is a bracket with an alignment  process representing the final step in the manufacture of the OR-336/A Cooler-Dewar Group, NSN 5855-01-172-1788.  B&A involves the installation of the bracket coupled with an extremely precise optical alignment procedure that together assures that the OR- 336/A Cooler-Dewar Group, NSN: 5855-01-293-1592, which is provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM), is properly bore-sighted when installed.  The performance of the bracket and alignment procedure requires a complex infrared optical alignment table,  computer interface measurement devices and infrared sources.  This solicitation will be issued on a Limited Competition basis since currently there are only two contractors,  Lockheed-Martin Corporation (Orlando, FL) and Canadian Commercial Corporation/DR S Technologies (Ontario, Canada), that have operational facilities with the necessary equipment needed to perform the required  B&A  procedures and meet the  Governments delivery schedule requirement.  The Government does not posses the technical data nec essary to enable competition for this proposed action.   The forecasted issuance date of the solicitation is on or about 14AUG2006.  The point of contact (POC) for this notice is Contract Specialist, Dennis Olson, who can be reached at the following email address: dennis.olson1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit, negotiate and award sole source to the New Jersey Institute of Technology, located in Newark, NJ, for the fabrication of  flexible and robust acoustic sensors. NJIT's level of comprehensiveness behind  their sensor hardening techniques and cost efficiency are much higher than  similar G-force hardening efforts. The simultaneous optimization of the  improved acousitc sensor and execution of the photolithographic process is  conducive to providing a minimal cost and is a relatively unique solution to  the problem of excessive expenditures in Clean Room fabrications.

1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks

8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

 Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
 the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
 award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
 (29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>This project involves herbicide spraying of noxious weeds within and adjacent to the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness (FC-RONRW).  Herbicide treatment will be conducted using backpack or stock pack sprayers.  This project includes three weed infested sites of approximately 15 - 20 acres each and two trail segments of approximately 4 miles each.  Each site is remote and will require appropriate access into the FC-RONRW.  Contractors will be required to be licensed as professional pesticide applicators by the State of Idaho.  All Idaho listed noxious weeds, as well as hoary alyssum (Berteroa incana), will be treated.  The Forest Service will provide specifications regarding the type and amount of herbicide to apply, treatment parameters and constraints, and treatment records to be completed by the contractor.  GPS units will be used by the contractor to record location of treatment sites.  Work will be solicited in Summer 2006 with work to be done in the Fall of 2006 and Spring of 2007.

<DESC>This is a Request for Comments and Information notice.  The US Coast Guard, ARSC, EISD, Elizabeth City NC is seeking vendor comments on a proposed solicitation document including Support By the Hour, specifications and a general project summary.  The Support By the Hour document and Specifications are posted on the public USCG website at www.uscg.mil/HQ/arsc/solicitations.htm   Then scroll down to the EISD contracting page to HSCG38-06-RFI-EISD007.  Comments/questions/expressions of interest in this acquisition should be directed to Constance W. Cox, Contracting Officer, tele 252 335-6895, e-mail Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil or FAX 252 335-6463.  First cutoff date for comments will be 15 August 2006.  While comments are not required for participation in the subsequent solicitation (estimated to be published within the next 60 days), comments from FSS/FLIR OEMS will be welcomed and considered.  NOTE:  disregard estimated solicitation issue dates as well as proposal due dates.  These will be corrected when the actual solicitation is posted.  

The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to equip up to 150 rotary wing aircraft with capable and supportable Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Systems (FSS).  The USCG is publishing this request for information to provide potential suppliers with an opportunity to review and comment on the specification, support contract and objectives.  Supplier FSS proposals will be evaluated for changeability, supportability, performance and life cycle costs.  The supplier will be responsible for insuring performance for the life of the system as defined in the enclosed Coast Guard support by the hour (SBH) document.  A government team has reviewed EO/IR market survey data and Coast Guard operational requirements to develop the enclosed FSS performance specification.  The specification defines desired and required EO/IR capabilities.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the enclosed documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  A request for proposals for FSS will be issued on or about 15 September 2006.  

1.	Process
The Coast Guard is publishing EO/IR FLIR Sensor Systems (FSS) requirements documentation and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the address listed below no later than 15 August 2006.  Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line ¡§FSS Specification Comments, Company Name¡¨.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will revise the FSS documents based upon industry comments and publish a solicitation for FSS procurement.  Proposals will be required on or about 15 September 2006.  The proposals will be evaluated by a Coast Guard Technical Evaluation Team with concurrent technical review and comment by NWSC Crane.  The target for the initial contract award is 15 November 2006.  The first article(s) will be required for evaluation on or about 15 February 2007.  First article tests will be performed both in the lab at NWSC Crane and in flight tests on Coast Guard aircraft.  Six systems will be procured as soon as possible.  Additional systems will be procured as funding becomes available.

2.	Scope
The FSS may be installed on any DHS aircraft.  The FSS will be installed on aircraft now operating without FLIR and the FSS will replace the FLIR systems currently in service on Coast Guard rotary wing aircraft. The requirement includes life cycle support, the EO/IR FSS system and recording capability.  The recording requirement may be a separate procurement from the FSS.  The support contract is intended for 150 Coast Guard aircraft.  Additional DHS aircraft may added as required.

3.	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (99) H-65 and (41) H-60 aircraft.  These aircraft require sensor improvements to support Coast Guard¡¦s Statutory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aircraft and, initially, a subset of the H-65 fleet.  There is an immediate need to equip six H-65 aircraft for operations in the fall of 2007 to support critical Airborne Use of Force national security requirements.  Current plans call for a minimum of 46 Airborne Use of Force aircraft equipped with FSS. From the point of award forward, FSS systems will be enrolled in a scalable support contract in increments of 10 systems up to an operational fleet of approximately 150 systems. 

The Coast Guard has identified the need to improve on typical industry support plans for FLIR systems.  The Coast Guard has over 20 years of experience with maintenance and repair support by the hour (SBH) for engines and avionics components.  The FSS SBH document was defined based on the successful support by the hour (SBH) agreements currently utilized by the Coast Guard.

4.	Objectives

4.1	Support
The Coast Guard support requirements are defined in the attached Support By the Hour (SBH) document.  Coast Guard aircraft operate in a demanding environment.  SBH is intended to insure the FSS is supported in the Coast Guard operating environment.  SBH is intended to align the supplier and Coast Guard interests to provide fully mission capable systems available for Coast Guard operations.  The supplier is responsible for the performance of their product.  SBH provides a framework for the Coast Guard and supplier partnership for the life of the FSS.  The Coast Guard will consider suggestions for modifications to the SBH plan.  Suppliers will be allowed to offer alternative support plans.  However, at a minimum pricing must be provided for the Coast Guard defined SBH.  Evaluation of suppliers will be based on life cycle costs derived from the Coast Guard SBH.

4.2	Performance
The Coast Guard FSS requirements are defined in the attached FLIR Sensor System (FSS) performance Specification.  Additional information is provided below for the key performance parameters.
	
4.2.1	Compatibility
The FSS must be capable of full integration with the aircraft to minimize impacts associated with weight, ground clearance, cabin space, and avoid safety issues such as emergency egress and hard landings.  The system must provide for ergonomic human interfaces compatible with aircrew personnel, procedures, equipment, and proficiency capabilities.  The FSS lighting, displays, controls and indicators shall be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.  The system must be have the capability to point and maintain sensor line-of-sight to a known or designated position.  The point command and data shall be capable of interface with a digital map system, Radar, CDU, Heads Up Display with Line of Sight (HUD/LOS) capability for turret control and/or video storage/datalink systems.

4.2.2	Identification
The primary technical performance evaluation standard will be the ability to read 6¡¨ letters during nighttime operations from in excess of 1 nautical mile.  The system shall include incorporation of a definitive planned product improvement program, specifically designed to enhance nighttime identification fidelity and standoff range.

4.2.3	Interface
The FSS must be designed to interface with the RADAR and provide the capability to slew the FSS to a RADAR contact or waypoint data, and slave the FSS to the contact.  The FSS must provide auto-track, auto-scan and auto-focus capability.  The FSS must provide a field of regard of 360 degrees continuous azimuth.  The system must include a hand controller that is portable throughout the cabin area, designed to minimize egress hazards and other potential interferences or safety hazards.  The FSS shall provide nominal operational configuration for urgent missions while using the minimum cabin compartment space practical for installation of mission hardware.  

4.2.3	Open Architecture

The FSS shall be designed to incorporate an open architecture to the greatest extent possible and use standard government and commercial protocols.  The system should minimize proprietary interfaces and systems.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Sylvatica (see www.sylvatica.com).  

BACKGROUND: 

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) studies building materials; computer-integrated construction practices; fire science and fire safety engineering; and structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering.  Products of the laboratory's research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and technical data that support innovations by industry and are incorporated into building and fire standards and codes.  One of BFRL’s major program areas is Healthy and Sustainable Buildings, to which the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) software project is a major contributor.  BEES uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental performance of building products.  A dozen environmental impacts are scientifically measured for each product, but two of these impact categories were found, during a recent NIST workshop, to be so poorly modeled by the existing EPA “TRACI” method that the workshop participants could not assess their relative importance.  These two methods were withdrawn from the more recent releases of EPA’s TRACI method because they are not well-developed.

NIST takes a lead role, with its BEES software, database, and methods, in providing guidance to federal purchasers and others about the life cycle environmental and economic performance of products.  In addition, BEES is increasingly used to evaluate and present information about bio-based products.  For all of these uses, the impacts of product life cycles on land use and water use can be very significant.  However, the existing methods for impact assessment for these two categories in North America are neither documented, peer-reviewed, nor well-developed.  This is a significant gap within the TRACI-based impact assessment methods provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and used by the thousands of users of NIST’s BEES tool.  Without valid impact assessment methods for water use and land use, decision makers are forced to ignore these impacts entirely when they make LCA-based decisions about products and policies.

The impact assessment methods whose development will be facilitated by this acquisition could prove useful to the “LCA into Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED)” activity of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).  The USGBC, a non-profit organization promoting environmentally friendly, or “green,” buildings, has developed the LEED rating system for assessing the greenness of buildings. In an effort to incorporate a stronger scientific basis into LEED, USGBC has initiated the “LCA into LEED” activity.  Since USGBC has decided to use the TRACI impact assessment approach for its LCA activity, any enhancements to TRACI developed for BEES could also prove very useful for LEED.

SCOPE OF REQUIRED WORK:

The scope of this acquisition is for a Contractor to launch a US project with North American advisors that will leverage National Science Foundation (NSF) funding to develop rigorous, peer-reviewed, data-driven and practical cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods that address these impact categories for BEES and are compatible with the US EPA’s TRACI system.

The objective of this acquisition is for a Contractor to build a research team with national expert participation, survey and report on the state of the art internationally on the impact categories of water use and land use, recruit and facilitate a project advisory panel with representatives from US EPA, NIST, US Geological Survey (USGS) Natural Resources Canada, and the Mexican Environmental Agency, Secretaria De Medio Ambiente Y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT), and launch the research project to address land use and water use.  The Contractor shall issue several reports documenting the state of the art and the state of available spatial databases on land use, soil and habitat resources, water use and water resources.  The Contractor shall also plan and facilitate an international workshop with invited papers contributing ideas to the development of rigorous and practical methods of LCIA for land and water use.

The Contractor shall generate two reports, a web-based data and research exchange hub, and will also plan and facilitate an international workshop.  The first report shall summarize the existing state of the art for LCIA of land use and water use worldwide.  The second report shall summarize available spatial databases concerning the availability of land and water resources and their use by processes in product life cycles, and suggest how these might best be used to develop rigorous and practical TRACI-compatible methods of LCIA for land and water use.  The website shall be interactive and designed to facilitate exchange of databases and methods, and to strengthen global collaboration on these two impact categories.  The Contractor shall post the proceedings of the workshop on the Internet.

Expected outcomes: More credibility for BEES and better environmental decision making by BEES users including Federal agencies, because BEES will offer a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the environmental impacts of products. 

FINDINGS:

Based on market research conducted by NIST, NIST has only been able to identify one potential source to provide the rare combination of expert services noted above: Sylvatica.  Sylvatica has over 10 years experience in Life Cycle Assessment, including the roles of directing the LCA methodology advancement program at the global level for the United Nations Environment Program, and also several projects for the U. S. E.P.A. that have developed and advanced methods within the EPA’s “TRACI” system for life cycle impact assessment.  Sylvaticsa’s extensive and varied background constitute unique expertise that will enable management of a project that brings together specialists in the area required by this procurement.  Therefore, NIST intends to award a sole source purchase order to Sylvatica under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) unless other responsible sources identify themselves to joseph.widdup@nist.gov on or before the response date for this posting and clearly and unequivocally demonstrate their relevant experience and current capability to provide the services required as noted above.  The Government will determine, based on written responses received in response to this posted notice, whether this procurement will be competed.

<DESC>Description
THIS NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.     
The United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development (hereby referred to as USDA RD or Agency) seeks to demonstrate the success and viability of two new programs within the Agency.  The two programs are the USDA RD Housing Voucher Program (Voucher Program) and the USDA RD Housing Preservation and Revitalization Restructuring Demonstration Program (Revitalization Program).  These programs are authorized under section 542 of the Housing Act of 1949 to protect tenants in federally-financed multifamily properties in the section 515 housing program, whose owners prepay the loans or when foreclosure occurs between October 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006, and to preserve and extend the availability of affordable rental housing in rural areas.  The purpose of the Voucher Program is to provide rental housing assistance vouchers to tenants residing in properties that prepay their USDA RD mortgage.  The USDA RD Voucher Program will be based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Choice Voucher Program.  Like HUD’s Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), the USDA RD contractor will function in a similar capacity, informing tenants of the Program, conducting rent comparability studies, entering into agreements with multi-family property owners, and issuing vouchers.  Under the USDA RD Revitalization Program, the Agency seeks to extend and preserve the availability of affordable multifamily rental housing in rural areas by identifying and assessing capital needs, using financial restructuring tools available to the Agency.  For tasks conducted under the Revitalization Program, the selected Contractor will function mostly as a consultant to assist the Agency with identifying which properties to revitalize, to analyze the estimated costs for revitalization efforts, and to assist the Agency in selecting the appropriate options and packages to finance each revitalization effort.   The Agency anticipates that tasks and work performed under one Program will impact the performance of tasks and the creation of regulations, policies and training materials under the other Program.

<DESC>Subject to the availability of funds and project approvals, VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for preparation of working drawings and specifications, cost estimates, submittal review and other construction period services for Project Number 528A7-07-701 Pharmacy Clean Room and Project Number 528A7-07-702 Polytrauma Bathrooms at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse, NY.  The purpose of this design is to provide Pharmacy with a space that meets USP 797 Sterile Compounding Standards, especially those related to environmental controls and to provide Rehab Medicine with space to meet the requirements of Public Law 108-447. The Pharmacy Project will provide an anteroom (or buffer room) with two distinct preparation areas (one for intravenous admixture compounding, one for chemotherapy admixture compounding).  The two preparation rooms shall meet all air exchange requirements to meet and ISO Class 5 Area – Class 100.  The space will required pass-thru airlocks, hands free washing, hands free access, smooth & cleanable walls of stainless or concrete with epoxy, sealed and cleanable ceilings, seamless floors, sealed electrical outlets, etc.  Rooms must be able to be monitored for temperature, humidity, and pressure differentials.  Positive room air pressure will be required with HEPA filtering.  A central wet vacuum with outside exhaust is recommended.  The current sterile preparation area shall be modified to provide alternate usable space for work or storage areas disrupted by the placement of the new area. The Polytrauma Project will convert one four-bed patient room to a two-bed patient room with a semi-private, handicapped accessible bathroom on 5 South.  This requires new finishes, new fixtures and accessories, changed to HVAC, upgraded lighting, new flooring, and age-specific interior decoration.  Public Law 108-447 requires VA to establish a new prosthetics and integrative health care initiative to support Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) combat veterans.  These military operations have resulted in new patterns of polytraumatic injuries to a younger group of individuals, requiring specialized intensive rehabilitation with age-specific considerations and sensitivity.  VA Syracuse is the Level 2 Polytrauma Center for VISN 2 (VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York). Investigative services shall include review of VA program requirements and project scope to determine the equipment and construction criteria, and to provide preliminary plans, drawings, and estimates.  Design services shall include, but not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates.  Services include meet with various VA employees, in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully review the space selected for this project, then prepare construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos abatement, if found to be required at any time during the project, shall be included.  Design services shall include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards.  Asbestos Monitoring services during construction may be required of the A/E as a reimbursable expense.  Design services may also include interior design including graphics, signage, equipment and furniture.  Providing computer generated color isometric views as directed by the COTR to illustrate the design may be required.  As required, Designer shall work with GSA contract vendors (as necessary and at designer’s expense) to develop furniture plans and drawings, window treatments, equipment listings and layouts for purchase directly by VA. Drawings will be CADD generated with Auto Cad 14.  Specifications shall be compiled from VA master specifications which are available on the internet.  Selection of the Architect/Engineer will be based on specialized experience, capability of the firm to perform, professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project, past performance for VA work and/or similar hospital projects, and the record of past performance in the form of a comparison between their estimates and actual project awards.  The area of consideration is restricted to firms within a 75 mile radius of the Medical Center.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on Standard Form 330 no later than August 28, 2006.  THREE COPIES OF EACH (along with any supplemental information) ARE REQUIRED.  Submission should emphasize experience on similar projects, the personnel to be assigned to this project, and specific VA experience.  A/E Selection may not be made until 4-6 weeks after receipt of applications and may not occur until December 2006.  This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 541310 applies. Construction cost estimate of both projects combined is between $250,000 and $500,000.

<ARCHDATE>10272006
<CONTACT>Joyce Ambrose, 732 427 1395
<DESC>Solicitation W15P7T-06-R-G520 is for a modification to Firm-Fixed-Price/Time and Materials (T&M) Contract Number DAAB07-03-C-A006 with L-3 Communications (L3), to increase the T&M Contract Line Item to enable additional interim contractor support, fi eld support, and engineering logistics and program services for the Phoenix Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) terminal through the duration of the contract period of performance. The Phoenix is a transportable multi-band, multi-channel Tactical Satellite (TACSAT ) terminal that operates in the C, X, Ka and Ku bands over commercial and military satellites.  It provides high-capacity range extension at selected Echelons Above Corps and Corps signal units. Phoenix provides a highly mobile, strategically transportable , wide band communications capability, and will replace selected AN/TSC-85/93 TACSAT terminals.  It is being used in missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and provides the Warfighter with unparalleled com munication enhancements.  T&M support services have been significantly greater than anticipated as a result of efforts in support of OEF and OIF. Consequently, an increase in the T&M Contract Line Item is needed to obtain support through the duration of th e contract period of performance. The services to be acquired consist of  (a) interim contractor support, which includes repair and overhaul, stockage, storage and issuance, (b) field support, which includes technical assistance, materiel fielding support,  and support of theatre operations, and (c) engineering logistics and program services, which includes logistics analysis, system engineering and integration support.  L-3 is the developer and original equipment manufacturer of the Phoenix, and maintains system-level and product-level configuration and data management control of this system.  The Phoenix is considered a state-of-the-art Satellite Terminal. The Phoenix an d its components are not defined by any nationally recognized industry standard or specification. The Government does not possess technical data or drawings to enable a competitive acquisition. L-3 is the only source that possesses the technical data, engi neering drawings, specifications, acceptance test procedures, depot repair parts, and costly special test equipment for the Phoenix and its components, all of which are necessary to provide the required services.   A Sole Source award will be made to L3, 640 North, 2200 West, P.O. Box 16850, Salt Lake City, Utah 84116-2925 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304( c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(1).   The POC for this acquisition is:  Mr. Dalip Singh, email  Dalip.Singh@us.army.mil.  See Numbered Note 22.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 64PP-6-0001 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 325414.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, ARS, MWA, Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO has a requirement/need for the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves.  The starting material will be provided by Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO.  CLIN No. 1 – Construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library.  CLIN No. 2 – EST Sequencing.  CLIN No. 3 – Delivery of a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves must meet or exceed these minimum requirements  (1) Must construct a normalized cDNA library from total Sprorobolus stapfianus RNA derived directly from material or provided by PGRU researchers.  cDNA synthesis should be of high efficiency and quality and utilize a rare restriction enzyme site contained in Primer Adapter sequence to increase cloning efficiency and ensure directionality.  cDNAs must be subjected to size selection.  No adapter ligation is to be used to construct the library (this can be achieved if an appropriate rare cutter restriction site is contained in the primer adapter used for cDNA synthesis).  A positive control should be used to monitor each step of library construction including overall efficiency.  A high copy number plasmid containing a suitable multiple cloning site must be used to generate the library.  The vector containing T7 promoter and SP6 promoter sites, an F1 phage origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance gene will be used.  The manufacturer must deliver a minimum of 3 x 106 primary clones (cfu) with an average inserted cDNA of greater than 1.0 kb in size and a minimum of at least 87% of the clones containing inserts.  (2)  EST Sequencing (sequencing of inserts).   Manufacturer will provide colony picking of 15,000 clones from the library for DNA purification and subsequent sequencing.  Sample genealogy and quality parameters should be tracked on a well-by-well basis to ensure accurate sample tracking and data quality, to give confidence in the integrity of the sequence data.  The tracking system should allow real-time assessment of pipeline success rates, quality scores, overall signal strengths and read lengths to maintain optimum performance and maximize sequence quality.  A passing sequence read should match the National Human Genome Research Institute’s standard definition; that is an attempt that yields a minimum of 100 PHRED 20 bases.  The expected quality should have pass rates for high copy plasmids of 85-90% with average Phred 20 read-lengths of 550-650 bp standard read type.  Manufacturer will deliver sequence data as trace files (.scf or .ab1).  A standard nomenclature system will be utilized: “CustomerAssignedPlateName”_”Well ID”_F or R. FileType”.  In addition, sequence files (.seq) and quality files (.qual) in FASTA format will be made available.  Preferably all information can be transferred via FTP.  (3) Manufacturer will deliver a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  The customer will receive glycerol stocks of normalized library in addition to the primary library if remaining after the normalization process. Manufacturer will also deliver any arrayed library plates that were generated for downstream sequencing by the Manufacturer.

<SUBJECT>66 -- National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute -  Siemens Medical Systems Magnet Installation
<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure on a sole source basis to Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, Pennsylvania for the installation of a 1.5T  Interventional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system purchased from Siemens.  This requirement will be obtained through a modification to NIH Contract Number N02-HL-3-4214 with Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. for a  “3.0 Tesla Interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging System.”  It is believed that Siemens is the sole source for this requirement based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this program is to support the collaborative research program between Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and NIH to study the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the clinical evaluation of novel interventional methods in cardiac MRI.  Over the last several years, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH has been developing new MRI techniques for the evaluation of cardiac patients.  NHLBI installed an interventional 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner in the Cardiology Branch to perform clinical evaluations of these methodologies.  This contract provides turn-key installation of a novel Interventional MRI system.  Successful operation of the system will be dependent on precise engineering required to smoothly integrate the new interventional MRI system.  This process requires the co-installation of a MR compatible x-ray fluoroscopy table that is customized to fit with the MRI machine.  All electronic connections and power sources for the system must be compatible with a RF shielded environment.  Modification of the scanner, control, and electronics rooms of the site will be required to install the new electronic components associated with both the new MRI scanner and the X-ray fluoroscopy table.   

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in writing within ten (10) calendar days after publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract modification based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Comments to this notice should reference contract number N02-HL-3-4214 and can be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6142, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-7902.

<DESC>CHINA ROAD SHOW – 
Program title to be determined
September 27-28, 2006
Boston, Massachusetts 
	
Hotel requirements for China road show event:

To allow for ease of access for potential media, the desired location for the hotel for the Boston China Road Show is the downtown/business/financial district of Boston.  The hotel must have adequate meeting space available for a two-day program on September 27-28, 2006.  The hotel must have a full service business center with copy, printing, facsimile, FedEx, and, preferably, close to a Kinko’s or other independent copy service.  The hotel must have an in-house or contract audio-visual service that can provide state of the art, professional production equipment and support throughout the conference.  Adequate parking facilities must be attached to hotel or located nearby.  Other proposed benefits, such as discounted parking for conference attendees, that will be of value to the USPTO (US Government) will be considered favorably when reviewing proposals.  The hotel must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Sleeping Room(s):

Up to 15 sleeping rooms for program staff (not registered attendees).  

Program staff includes: 5 sleeping rooms for U.S. Government employees – check in date September 26, 2006 and check out date September 28, 2006.  Rooms will be paid on Government travel card – not to be included in hotel contract;

8 sleeping rooms for non- U.S. Government employees  - check in date September 26, 2006 and check out date September 28, 2006 (these dates subject to change).   Rooms will be paid for by personal credit cards – not to be included in hotel contract; and

2 sleeping rooms for non-U.S. Government employees  - check in date September 26, 2006 and check out date September 28, 2006 (these dates subject to change).  Rooms will be paid for under the conference hotel contract by USPTO.  The room rate for all sleeping rooms in the block should be included in the proposal.

The USPTO makes no arrangements or commitments for sleeping rooms for the conference audience (attendees).  A sleeping room list of program staff will be provided to the hotel by the USPTO.

Main Conference Meeting Room(s):

A conference room is required to accommodate up to 200 people in classroom set-up on September 27 and 28.  The room should be large enough for attendee seating, an A/V worktable in back, platform for projection camera, and a dais in the front of the room with space for a podium, a table for three for panel discussions on September 27 and the morning of September 28, and a table for up to seven for panel discussions for the afternoon of September 28, 2006.  The space is required on September 27 and 28 from 8:00am to 6:00pm, however, the room should be set up the evening of September 26.  High speed Internet access is required in the main conference room on for the duration of the conference.

Break Out Room(s): 

On Thursday, September 28, 2006 a separate breakout room is required from noon to 6:00 pm. This room should be able to seat up to 100 people classroom-style, however, if a room is not available to accommodate classroom-style, consideration will be given for theater-style seating.   A dais for up to five people is needed for panel discussions, and there should be adequate space in the back of the room for an AV table to be set up.  High-speed Internet access is also required for this room.

Food and Beverage for Conference Breaks:

Morning and afternoon breaks are required on September 27 and 28.  These breaks should be set up outside of the main conference room.  The morning break food and beverage should consist of a la carte menu items such as coffee, juice, water, soda, Danish, bagels, etc.  The afternoon break food and beverage should consist of a la carte menu items such as coffee, water, soda, cookies, brownies, etc.  

Audio Visual:

The USPTO China road shows require state of the art professional production audio/visual equipment.  Aside from the equipment, we will need professional personnel to set up the site, be on-site throughout the two-day event to run the equipment and trouble shoot any problems which may arise during the conference, and take down the site after the conference. The audiovisual equipment may need to be set up on Tuesday, September 26, 2006.  No videotaping of the program is required.

The AV support requires a technical director who has experience organizing, planning, and supporting a high-level corporate structure and conference management in a professional manner.  The technical director should provide special attention to presenters, staff, and the conference team and be attentive to all needs of the staff prior to and during the conference event.

The main conference room for both days requires double screens, IMAG, PowerPoint projection, and audio.

The break out room will need to be set up on Thursday, September 28, 2006 with a single screen, PowerPoint projection, and audio.  No IMAG is needed for the break out room.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. AG-64PP-S-06-0002 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 325414.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, ARS, MWA, Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO has a requirement/need for the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves.  The starting material will be provided by Plant Genetics Research Unit, Columbia, MO.  CLIN No. 1 – Construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library.  CLIN No. 2 – EST Sequencing.  CLIN No. 3 – Delivery of a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  the construction of a normalized plasmid cDNA library and the subsequent sequencing of 15,000 ESTs, from Sprorobolus stapfianus leaves must meet or exceed these minimum requirements  (1) Must construct a normalized cDNA library from total Sprorobolus stapfianus RNA derived directly from material or provided by PGRU researchers.  cDNA synthesis should be of high efficiency and quality and utilize a rare restriction enzyme site contained in Primer Adapter sequence to increase cloning efficiency and ensure directionality.  cDNAs must be subjected to size selection.  No adapter ligation is to be used to construct the library (this can be achieved if an appropriate rare cutter restriction site is contained in the primer adapter used for cDNA synthesis).  A positive control should be used to monitor each step of library construction including overall efficiency.  A high copy number plasmid containing a suitable multiple cloning site must be used to generate the library.  The vector containing T7 promoter and SP6 promoter sites, an F1 phage origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance gene will be used.  The manufacturer must deliver a minimum of 3 x 106 primary clones (cfu) with an average inserted cDNA of greater than 1.0 kb in size and a minimum of at least 87% of the clones containing inserts.  (2)  EST Sequencing (sequencing of inserts).   Manufacturer will provide colony picking of 15,000 clones from the library for DNA purification and subsequent sequencing.  Sample genealogy and quality parameters should be tracked on a well-by-well basis to ensure accurate sample tracking and data quality, to give confidence in the integrity of the sequence data.  The tracking system should allow real-time assessment of pipeline success rates, quality scores, overall signal strengths and read lengths to maintain optimum performance and maximize sequence quality.  A passing sequence read should match the National Human Genome Research Institute’s standard definition; that is an attempt that yields a minimum of 100 PHRED 20 bases.  The expected quality should have pass rates for high copy plasmids of 85-90% with average Phred 20 read-lengths of 550-650 bp standard read type.  Manufacturer will deliver sequence data as trace files (.scf or .ab1).  A standard nomenclature system will be utilized: “CustomerAssignedPlateName”_”Well ID”_F or R. FileType”.  In addition, sequence files (.seq) and quality files (.qual) in FASTA format will be made available.  Preferably all information can be transferred via FTP.  (3) Manufacturer will deliver a glycerol stock of the transformed cDNA library.  The customer will receive glycerol stocks of normalized library in addition to the primary library if remaining after the normalization process. Manufacturer will also deliver any arrayed library plates that were generated for downstream sequencing by the Manufacturer.   REJECTION OF QUOTATION:     Failure to demonstrate compliance will be cause to reject the quote without further discussions. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

Offeror’s are required to submit a minimum of three relevant evaluations for similar contracts from Federal, state and local Government.

However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.

SHELVING SPECIFICATIONS:    The shelves shall be solid steel of clip type or nut-and bolt type construction in accordance with Federal Specifications AA-S-1048 or AA-S-271d.  Open or skeleton type shelving units shall be provided.  Two levels of both side and back cross strap braces are required on all shelving units (Seismic Level 1).  The shelving must be powder-coated with a polyester epoxy hybrid or best equivalent available that passes NARA-conducted or independent lab tests for hardness, and coating stability, bending, adhesion, and durability.  All shelving shall be a parchment color, per Federal Standard 595a, or other equally light reflective color.  DIMENSIONS:  The shelving units shall be constructed in accordance with NARA¡¦s FRC Shelving Drawing Number 1, (attached).  All shelving units to be provided and installed shall comply with very strict specifications in order to achieve optimal records storage capacity and access with the use of standard-size records storage boxes, size 10¡¨ deep x 12¡¨ wide x 15¡¨ long.  Overall height of 12-shelf units is 135 inches.  Overall height for 14-shelf units is 159 inches. These overall heights are specified for space, operational and fire safety reasons.  The primary shelving units shall be size 30¡¨ deep x 42¡¨ wide, with a minimum load carrying capacity of 300 pounds each.  Fill-out shelving units, size 30¡¨d x 30¡¨w, minimum load carrying capacity of 200#, and 16¡¨ w x 30¡¨d, minimum load carrying capacity of 100#, are also required.  All shelves are to be spaced on 12-inch vertical centers above 2-inch high base closures.  In order to accommodate standard size records storage boxes and servicing space, the following clearances must be provided on the faces of all units.  At least 39¡¨ of clear horizontal shelf space must be provided between the posts on all of the 42¡¨ wide units.  At least 10-1/2¡¨ of clear vertical storage space must be provided between all installed shelves.  2¡¨ high base closures must be provided on the face of all shelving units so that all records stored on the bottom shelves throughout the facility will be 3¡¨ above the floor finish in order to avoid damage to the records shelved on the bottom shelves from water spills as well as to avoid the accumulation of dust or files spillage under the bottom shelves.  30¡¨ wide x 135¡¨ high or 159¡¨ high (depending on upright height) end panels (partitions) shall be installed on the sides of all units facing the main 5¡¦ wide service aisles.

Special 34-inch wide mobile aluminum pulpit ladders are used to access all records stored on the upper shelves.  Each pulpit ladder has as its base rigid guide rollers on the sides of the four corners, which roll along the 42-inch wide shelving base closures, 2-inches above the floor surface, for smooth movement of the ladder in order not to bump and damage the shelved records.  All shelving base closures must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the shelving unit, at both ends.  The units will not become dislodged by the four guide rollers of the aluminum pulpit ladders during their movement in the aisles while servicing the stored records, or by common impact forces within the storage space.  INSTALLATION SERVICES:  The successful shelving contractor shall furnish the steel shelving and all associated supervision, personnel, tools, materials, and transportation necessary to install the shelving as ordered by NARA.  The shelving Contractor shall unload trucks, unpack, assemble and install the shelving in accordance with floor plans and instructions to be provided by the Contracting Officer¡¦s Representative (COR).  Shelving units shall be installed to the maximum extent in double (back-to-back) rows in accordance with FRC Shelving Drawing No. 1.

The maximum tolerance from the vertical will be 1 inch in 10 feet or more in height.  Installation shall allow top shelf storage of records in standard size boxes.  SHELVING DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  The anticipated delivery schedule for installation of the base requirement is as follows:  Bay 1 (135¡¨ high shelving) in Lenexa, KS within 90 days of award date; Bay 2 (159¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, October 2006; Bay 3 (159¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, May 2007; Bay 4 (135¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, October 2007.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI) is seeking the services of a contractor to perform its demonstration project, titled ?Developing Community Based Models for Education and Utilization of Family Health History Information.?  THIS IS A COMBINED SOLICITATION / SYNOPSIS.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(HG)2006-266/KLW and the solicitation is issued as an request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions.   The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 - ?All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services? and the small business size standard is $6.5 Million. 

The Statement of Work for the requirement is as follows:  Mission:  The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Research Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. The NHGRI?s mission has since expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease.   To that end, the NHGRI supports the development of resources and technologies that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A central component of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.  To carry out its diverse duties the Education and Community Involvement Branch (ECIB) leads the Institute?s public education efforts. The branch initiates, develops, implements and evaluates education and community involvement programs to engage a broad range of the public in understanding genomics and its translation to health and society. The branch also acts as the liaison between the NHGRI and communities to further its mission, and oversees programs and initiatives for minorities and special populations.   Background of the Project:  To help focus attention on the importance of family history to health, U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona, M.D., M.P.H., in cooperation with other agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has launched a national public health campaign, called the U.S. Surgeon General?s Family History Initiative, to encourage all American families to learn more about their family health histories. Thanksgiving Day of 2004 was named the first annual National Family History Day.  In addition to the Office of the Surgeon General, other HHS agencies involved in this project include the National Human Genome Research (NHGRI), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Agency for healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).   The NHGRI will support contracts designed to engage a targeted community about the importance of family history to health. Specifically, the NHGRI will support the development and the dissemination of model programs that engage communities (e.g., health professionals, community based organizations, and the public) in enhancing the knowledge of genetics and health. The Education and Community Involvement Branch (ECIB) seeks to expand family history outreach efforts and to inform more people about the Family History Tool and to encourage their use of family history to improve health. To this end, ECIB seeks to fund a model demonstration project and support materials to educate and engage a targeted community or community group about the collection and use of their own family health history information.   As examples, the types of activities and audiences that may be proposed include: 1) engagement and education of rural communities and use of technology to provide genetics family health history education; 2) engagement of community groups such as churches, civic associations, fraternal organizations, and other community based organizations; 4) engagement of underserved minority and disadvantaged populations; 5) use of the arts to communicate genetics health education and family history; and (6) using the internet as a tool to educate and engage the public about the collection and use of family health history information. Many other types of activities and audiences may be proposed.   Objectives for Project:  The selected contractor will develop and implement a demonstration project to create tools and methods to engage a targeted community or community group (as defined above) about the importance of family history to health. These methods and materials should be adaptable as models to educate and engage other communities about the importance of collecting family history and using the Family History tool in health care. As part of the demonstration project, the contractor should also be familiar with existing family history education tools and, where appropriate, incorporate these into the project.   The objectives of the Demonstration Project ?Developing Community Based Models for Education and Utilization of Family Health History Information? include: 1) Increase awareness of the importance of collecting family history information in health care in a targeted community or community group;  2) Develop and implement culturally appropriate methods and materials to engage audiences around use of family history information;  3) Educate the community on how to access the Surgeon General?s Family History tool electronically;   4)  Educate the community on how to collect family history information (including how to engage other family members in the collection);  5) Develop a model that can be applied to other targeted communities or community groups educating the public about the importance of collecting family history;  6) Evaluate materials and methods created; and 7) Disseminate findings nationally.  Scope of Project:  The selected organization will plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a demonstration project on education about family history and utilization of family history information. In doing such, a model will be established so that other communities can use the educational materials and methods to educate members of the public on the importance and collection of family history information.   The project proposal should be in the form of a 10-15 page word document outlining: 1) The target community;  2) The plan to engage the community;  3) Previous or current projects involving target community;  4)  What challenges are anticipated in engaging this community;  5) The proposed methods to be used to engage and educate the community;  6) The proposed tools to be used;  7) A description of the evaluation plan of the demonstration project;  8) Project personnel; and 9) Detailed Budget.    Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the selected organization (referred to as Contractor) will furnish all of the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the specific tasks delineated below.    Tasks of the Project:   1) Develop methods to engage the target community using printed, audiovisual, or distance learning materials/methods (telemedicine, on-line); Engage the target community; 2) Where appropriate, implement existing family history education materials into the demonstration project; 3) Develop materials including information on why collecting family history is important and useful to individual and family health; 4) Develop materials on how to engage one?s family in collecting appropriate family history information; and 5) Evaluate methods and materials.   During the course of these tasks, a representative from the selected organization will communicate monthly with a representative from the NHGRI. This communication will take the form of a phone call or meetings and will serve to provide the NHGRI with regular updates on the progress of the activities identified above. The monthly communication will also serve as an opportunity for problem solving and strategizing throughout the collaboration, including the development and implementation phase. The organization?s representative and the NHGRI representative will establish a schedule for the monthly communication.   Deliverables: The deliverable are as follows: 1) Planning document, outlining who will be involved in the demonstration project, and how (this should be due one month after the contract is awarded); 2) Materials to educate the public including printed, audiovisual or distance learning (e.g., on-line, telemedicine); 3) A final project product that demonstrates the model of engaging a community in collecting family history information that can be used in other targeted communities or community groups; and 4) A final evaluation report of the Demonstration Project.  Payment Schedule: An invoice schedule will be agreed upon at the time the contract is awarded. Upon approval of the technical progress, the project officer will approve partial payments.   There is no government furnished equipment associated with the requirement.  The period of performance is September 15, 2006 through September 30, 2007.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The quotations will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Project Objectives - Does the proposal implement the objectives of the demonstration project?; 2) Approach - Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analysis plan adequately developed, well integrated, well reasoned, and appropriate to the aims of the proposal?  
Are the milestones and evaluation procedures appropriate?; 3) Innovation - Is the project original and innovative?; 4) Investigators - Is the Principal Contractor appropriately trained and capable of coordinating and managing the proposed project?; 5) Environment - Is there sufficient access to resources (e.g., equipment, facilities, capabilities)?; and 6) Project Tasks - Does the proposal describe appropriately how the contractor will accomplish the project tasks? Does the proposal adequately describe their targeted community for this project?  Does the contractor demonstrate an ability to work effectively with this community? 

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors providing the requested services.   Therefore, the initial offer should contain the Offeror?s best terms from a technical and price standpoint.    Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a proposal detailing how each aspect of the statement of work is to be accomplished.  The  technical approach should be in as much detail as you consider necessary to fully explain your proposed technical approach or method.  The technical plan should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken.  The technical plan must include information on how the project is to be organized, staffed, and managed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60115-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-11.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Technology Transfers Branch (TTB) plans to enter into a contract with an organization to enhance the current Technology Information Management System (TIMS) database with enhanced features and re-program TIMS to maximize features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541511, and the business size standard is $21M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background:  
	General Description: The Technology Transfer Branch (TTB) of the Federal Government’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) converted eight (8) individual and separate flat files of varying record size from FileMaker Pro (FMPro) version 4.1 into a FMPro 6.0 relational database referred to as the Technology Information Management System (TIMS).  Contracts have been awarded to design the new relational database, to design a user interface, and build the database.  The TTB now requires FMPro expertise to upgrade and enhance the database.
	
	Evolution of Requirements: A self-designed “unrelated” FMPro system had been used by TTB for the management and tracking of mission-related work since the early 1990s.  In the late 1990's TTB determined that the number of records and the needs of the office had outgrown the capabilities of the “unrelated” database system.  A relationally designed database  to most efficiently maintain the integrity of and standardize the entry of data, to track mission-related efforts and to produce accurate and cogent reports was developed and has been in use since November 2002.  TTB continues to enhance TIMS to meet the changing needs of NCI and TTB.  Those needs include new technology transfer requirements, specialized reporting to the Office of the Director, NCI, and changes in TTB procedures.		
	
Purpose and Objective:

The TTB is responsible for negotiating agreements between NCI scientist and private sector companies for the collaborative development of federally funded bio-medical research into commercially successful products.  The Main focus of these collaborative efforts is to produce commercial products that will improve the public health.  In addition, the TTB is also a Competitive Service Center (CSC) for technology transfer.  Under the CSC, the TTB negotiates agreements for 10 other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health.  One of the responsibilities of these collaborative agreements is to track the agreement negotiations from initial request to execution of the agreement, and through agreement expiration to final destruction of the physical file itself.  This process can span several years and involve many tracking dates.  TTB currently negotiates eight different types of agreements for the NIH. 
	
	The specific objectives of this procurement are to: 1) enhance the current TIMS database with enhanced features such as reporting, advertising, action items, etc. and 2) re-program  TIMS to maximize the features of FileMaker 8.0 or most current version.

Statement of Work:
	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
	
	Specific Tasks to be Performed:  The contractor shall provide technical skills, insights and expertise on FMPro database development and implementation.  The contractor shall be a certified FileMaker Pro 8 developer.  Due to the complexity of the information that is tracked in the TIMS database, the many inter-relationships of the various agreements, and the need to obtain and integrate into TIMS data from other databases which are written in different programming languages, the contractor shall have at least 10 years FMPro experience in order to perform the work.   TTB shall provide all TTB mission-related information necessary to develop the database upon execution of contract.
	

	1.  	Add additional features to the database from the list of projects below.   The order in which additional features are selected to work on will be determined by a variety of factors such as needs of TTB, logical progression depending on re-programming (see 2 below), etc.  
	
	2.	Re-program the current TIMS database in FileMaker Pro 8.0 to maximize the features of version 8 and enhance the current database structure, file structure and user interface and produce a Beta version: The contractor shall build all of the files with field definitions, create relationships between the files, show related data, and put business rules and constraints in place on field values.  The contractor shall test the system for: 1) the database and file structure design, 2) the user interface for functionality.  Once the system is upgraded, tested, and bug free, the Contractor shall provide a beta version to TTB for testing.  The contractor shall install the Beta version on TTB's server and on 5 TTB staff members' computers.  TTB Staff shall use the beta version for 10 business days and provide comments to the Project Officer.  The Project Officer shall inform the Contractor of all comments.  Corrections and changes shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days from of receipt of comments and corrections.   The Contractor shall provide the final version of the system in a client/server format for about 51 TTB staff members.
	

	3.  	The final product shall be Section 508 compliant.
							
	PROJECTS LIST:
	

	
	1.	Reports:
		a)	Add ability to design or customize individual reports.
b)	Add/enhance ability to easily export report information into Word or Excel

	2.  	Search Function:
		a)	Enhance the search capabilities so they are more flexible and robust
		b)	Add the ability to remove or omit specific records from a found set 
	
	3.  	General
a)	Create the ability, like in old FMPro to move from record to record in a found set 	without going back and forth to a list of records. 
b)	The scroll feature needs work so that when you have scrolled down a list of 	records, selected and examined one record, and come back to the main screen,	 	you will go to the record you selected and not up to the top of the list as it 	currently is set.  [it is called Sticky Portal]
	c)	Ability to add text to modules/records
	d)	Link the status to the date field
	e)	Add Spell Check option so that it offers ability to add names, etc. so they don’t 			come up again and again. [This may be a standard feature in FMP 8+]
	f)	Make fields with pull down menus not modifiable
 
	4.  	CRADA Module
	a)	Program the amendments window to allow for page breaks and multi-page 			documents.
	b)	Make it easier to generate a CRADA amendment
	c)	The Amendment Form Header pulls from the same updated fields as the 				Clearance form, yet the information required for each is different.  Program so it 			pulls in the current information in its fields, not the new information being added 			via the amendment.  The latter should be captured in the body of the amendment. 
d)	When the months for a CRADA amendment extension are entered in the record, 	have the expiration date be automatically recalculated by the system.
e)	Appendix C Language Changes table searchable for each paragraph and ability to 	review the language.

	5.  	CTA Module

a)	Add Negotiator field and a specialist field in the CTA module as exists in all other 	agreement modules.

	6.  	AdOps Module 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	7.  	Extramural Invention Waivers 
		a)	Redesigned
	
	8.  	Letters and Memos
	a)	Have the ability to save modified letters for specific agreements within the 				agreement record in TIMS. [As a PDF file would be best.  This would be 				helpful in moving to a “document management system”.  Should also consider 			adding patent document to the EIR record, these document could include: OTT 			recommendation, original EIR, patent application, etc.]
b)	Have ability to print address labels from the contacts/org modules and to have the 	address merge into a letter.


9.	EIR Module

a)	Add Automatic Action item to generate a report if the future “Cost Sharing” 	button is added.
b)	Add ability to pull the issued patent from USPTO website.  This is relatively easy 	since there is a 	specific web-link for each Patent.  I am sure this could be applied 	to the published patent 	applications, including foreign patents and patent 	applications.  We just need the web-link 	information.
c)	Add ability to add post TRG items, similar to TRG Requests. This would help 	tracking the transactional development items in an EIR.

	10. 	Action Items

	a)	Move the Action Items toward an Agreement History, that is, remove the 				comments field and make every “comment” and Action Item a “History Item” 
b)	Certain action items should be a mandatory part of what we do (one year post 	provisional, 18 months post PCT filing, 3 months prior to CRADA expiration, 2 	months prior to CRADA LOI expiration).  TTB to decide what things need to be 	mandatory action items, then Colleen will need to program.
	
	11. 	Ability to set non-PHS/NIH contacts on Signatory List.  Currently the user can only designate PHS/NIH Contacts as “signatory”.  We need this function to identify a non-PHS/NIH Contact as signatory so their name appears on an agreement signature block.
	
	12.  	Create and store .pdf of agreement related documents 
	If standard NIH document with no modifications 
	then .pdf of signature page is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If standard NIH document with modifications 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If non-standard NIH document 
	then .pdf of entire document is scanned, imported to TIMS and stored 
	If printing an agreement, have the option to add a PDF file into TIMS (or specific location) See idea below (next bullet) for printing letter/memos/forms.
	(All scanned document are sent to a "default" location and stored so TIMS knows where to find them)
	
	13.  	Have a feature added which asks User "is this final?" when printing letter/memo/internal document. This would eliminate the multiple Automatic Action Items when documents (Letters/Memos/Forms are printed multiple times before the User is satisfied.
•	If yes, then --> 
	(a) TIMS generates an automatic .pdf, stores it in the record (allowing for retrieval/usage at later time) 
	(b) Generates automatic action item 
•	If no, then --> 
	(a) no .pdf file is generated or stored 
	(b) no automatic action is generated 
	14.  	Incorporate QC into the TIMS fields:
•	“Specialist” is filled in.
•	Status and Date fields match
&#61607;	If status is ‘active’ then execution date is completed
&#61607;	If status is ‘expired’ then expiration date has past
&#61607;	If status is ‘terminated’ then termination date is complete
&#61607;	If status is ‘withdrawn’ then withdrawn date is complete
•	For CRADAs make sure ‘Type’ is not empty
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then Abstract field is complete
•	For CRADAs if status is active, then term is not empty
•	CTAs if status is active, then ‘materials field is not empty
•	For EIRs NIH Reference number matches the appropriate type and status
•	For EIRs if the status is filed, then the filing date is not empty
•	For EIRs, if the type is EIR then the date received is complete
	15.  	Add a “sub-status” field to cover an EIR moving to Research Tool 
	16.  	Add a “Project” drawer, to track non-agreement projects.  The “Project” drawer would allow the User to ‘link’ to other agreements such that a Project could lead to an agreement. 
	17.  	Add ERROR message to MTA record if Material information (Developed under grant, Research of Human Subjects, 45 CFR Part 46 & Assurance number) are not filled out. Make this section stand out in the record (change text to red?)
	18.  	Re-design or re-word or if possible, get rid of error message created when TIMS is incorrectly exited by User.
	19.  	Add a field to MTAs for "Protocol Number".  In light of the new human subject assurance documentation, it would be helpful to have this field.
	

	DATABASE SPECIFICATIONS:.
	
	User Interface will be designed for 17 inch monitors with industry standard Web dimensions 1024 X 768 Pixels

Period of Performance: The period of performance for this effort begins 2006 Sep 15, or date of award whichever is later, for a period of one (1) year from issuance of official purchase order.

STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION
These project topics will investigate various approaches to controlling and treating Wet-Weather Flow (WWF) discharges in the urban watershed.  WWF pertains to storm induced discharges which can come from Non-Point Source (NPS), stormwater outfalls, Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) and Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO).  Dry-weather overflows, which are prohibited for sanitary or combined systems, are typically an indication of failing infrastructure and maintenance problems and storm systems are typically an indication of cross connections (i.e., improper connections or illegal discharges).  

The Urban Watershed Management Branch (UWMB) of Edison, New Jersey seeks to develop innovative urban technologies and assist municipalities and utilities in the selection of appropriate technologies to control urban discharges especially those caused by WWF or failing infrastructure and cross connections.

BACKGROUND  
WWF including CSO, SSO and stormwater discharges are one of the leading causes of water-quality impairment in the United States today and improvement of controls remains a priority water focus area of the EPA.  Pollution problems stemming from these WWF are extensive throughout the country.  Problem constituents in WWF include visible matter, pathogens, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), suspended solids, nutrients, and toxicants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, and petroleum hydrocarbons).  National estimates have projected costs for WWF pollution abatement in the tens of billions of dollars.  Municipalities therefore need alternatives to control the high costs of WWF treatment prior to release. 

In urban areas, there is limited space to implement stormwater controls.  Land is more valuable developed than devoted to stormwater control devices which typically require significant surface area.  Therefore, innovative technological advances and risk management approaches are necessary to reduce the severity of pollution and the cost of treatment.

The design of stormwater systems is still evolving.  With separation of stormwater from sanitary systems, a new pollution routing mechanism was created.  Originally, stormwater conveyance systems discharged collected runoff to the nearest receiving water, without storage or treatment, increasing downstream flooding.  To rectify flooding, detention basins were mandated for new developments prior to discharge.  However, stormwater systems and detention basins increased pollution to receiving waters, so the extended detention concept was introduced to overcome limitations of flood control detention ponds.  Extended detention provided more and better control of the smaller and more frequent storm events that just passed through flood basins.  Over the years, other Best Management Practice (BMP) designs have been developed to address the complexities of storage and treatment with varying results.    

Many municipalities are increasingly subject to Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) on solids, nutrients and pathogenic indicators.  While existing BMPs may be capable of reducing solids to receiving waters, the benefits of installing BMPs for other TMDLs are not proven.  BMPs typically are not optimally designed to remove nutrients or pathogenic indicators.  A more active approach to stormwater management using proven concepts for routing, storage and treatment developed for sanitary systems and waste-water treatment plants subject to intense wet-weather flow may be warranted for urban areas subject to TMDLs.  This is especially true of many urban areas that still discharge stormwater without any retention and/or treatment and do not have the available space to implement existing stormwater BMP designs.  

Many European nations opted to continue to use combined sewer systems instead of switching over to separate sanitary and storm sewer systems so as to treat stormwater centrally with high rate treatment mechanisms.  The practice of installing new combined sewers in the U.S. is not popular.  However collecting a portion of the urban stormwater that is driving implementation of  TMDLs and pumping it through an aggressive treatment or pumping to a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) may help to address TMDLs.  Helping municipalities identify urban areas for pump and treat, will also be a goal of this project. 

Municipalities also need alternatives to control the high costs of wastewater treatment.  The implementation of grey water plumbing adjustments, require a knowledge base of treatment rates and cost effectiveness.  With more municipalities in the United States looking for flexible ways to process and treat potable water and wastewater, developing grey water systems is a vital initiative for the EPA.  Domestic sanitary wastewater that has been exposed to fecal material is black water and requires extensive treatment.  Grey water is wash water that has not been exposed to fecal material.  Grey water is far less polluted or dangerous and does not require as aggressive treatment.  There are varying definitions of grey water but it is typically from the following waste streams: showers, sinks, and appliances.  Volumetrically, grey water is estimated to be 40 to 85% of the per capita waste stream.  Grey water recycling and treatment serves the dual purpose of reducing potable water demand and wastewater volumes.  Performance and cost research for grey water is needed for municipalities and private entities to decide to implement this technology.  Grey water recycling and onsite treatment can be a benefit to both sewered areas suffering from WWF issues including CSO, SSO and unsewered areas that use septic systems.  Diverting grey waters to recycle or alternative treatment systems will reduce the volume to septic systems, averting untimely failures and providing greater detention times for treatment.  Waste streams diverted from sanitary systems will also reduce volumes of overflows and at wastewater treatments.   Performance data are required so that clear performance goals for grey water control by onsite treatment systems can be incorporated with other urban watershed controls. 



OBJECTIVES 
These requirements shall investigate a range of technology topics for urban watershed management control.  This will be done through literature searches, data collection, desktop analyses and evaluation, modeling, and possibly field/pilot studies with sampling and analysis, and development of a final manuscript with conclusion and recommendations for each of the particular topics. 

APPROACH 
From one to six separate purchase orders will be awarded under this Statement of Work for the six project topics listed below:  

 
1.	Disinfection optimization approach to WWTP design
2.	Stormwater pathogen indicator routing for TMDL effectiveness
3.	Recycling greywater for non-potable uses and irrigation
4.	Treatment of greywater using wetlands
5.	CSO concepts for stormwater treatment				
6.	Advanced drainage design concepts
	
	A more thorough description of these project topic areas is provided below.   
	
	The studies shall be comprised of literature searches, desktop analysis, modeling and sampling and analyses.  
	
	The specific project topic(s) for quote submittal and award are below: (Note: One order or up to six separate orders can be issued to an offeror.  Additionally, offerors can submit a quote for each individually or any combination of up to all six topics): 
	
	1)	A disinfection optimization approach to WWTP design or WWTP retrofitting or upgrading:   This relates to the EPA’s national CSO policy which requires primary treatment plus disinfection, (i.e., disinfection in states where required and to EPA’s SSO blending rulemaking effort).  Disinfection often can only effectively disinfect the free floating or surface microorganisms due to the relatively short residence time of the WWF, and, depending on the degree of upstream treatment, may not be effective if microorganisms are contained in larger protective solids.  The degree of primary treatment vs the degree of disinfection is often an overlooked component of both policies, but there is a clear need for optimizing the treatment approaches as both primary treatment and increased disinfection cost money.  
	
	2)	Development of a method for stormwater pathogen indicator routing for TMDL effectiveness and receiving water impacts:   Nationally, many TMDL contraventions are based on requirements to reduce indicator organisms, e.g. fecal coliform/total coliform.  In many TMDL approaches, the recommended mechanism for this indicator microorganism reduction is the use of BMPs but there is little, if any data supporting BMP effectiveness for indicator organism reduction.  Limited studies for BMP microorganism indicator reduction show little effect or even a magnification of indicator microorganism concentrations.  Conventional BMP removal mechanisms, (i.e., settling and filtering) typically at best only remove the fraction of indicator organisms attached to the fraction of particulate matter that settles.  Implementation of BMPs should not contribute to compromising the receiving water's desired use.  This project would attempt to show a way for watershed districts to analyze the problem on a scientific and engineering basis to determine what is really needed to satisfy TMDLs.  Ultimately, it may be necessary to route more watershed runoff through proven disinfection technologies. 
	
	3)	A desktop analysis of greywater recycling for urban watersheds in different hydrologic regions:  A volumetric analysis would be modeled to determine seasonal raw water supply requirements, wastewater volumes produced, and river flows under various scenarios for greywater recycling supplemented with captured runoff.  A final manuscript will be provided detailing costs of the various scenarios, including water and wastewater utility costs, costs of the greywater and runoff capture systems and compared with costs of conventional water and wastewater services.  A discussion of environmental effects and human health issues will accompany each scenario.  The results shall be useful to identify when and where greywater recycling and/or stormwater capture for recycling is feasible and cost effective. 
	
	4)	A greywater study to examine the efficacy of on-site wetland treatment:  Stressors to be analyzed include indicator microorganisms and pathogens, selected viruses, organic material (TOC, BOD), suspended solids (SS), and nutrients.  The study should describe findings and recommendations regarding the viability of wetland treatment of greywater, and further research needs.  Tests shall use experimental design procedures to assess statistical significance.  A minimum of 10 sampling events shall be used for monitoring, however a statistically valid amount of sampling events and an acceptable amount of experimental error must be determined in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP -described in further detail below).
	
	5)	CSO control and treatment methods to improve separate stormwater systems: Separately-sewered stormwater systems are increasingly subject to permitting and treatment and control methods for discharges to address TMDLs.  This topic shall investigate and develop implementable concepts for stormwater systems that range from simple concepts like increased storage for stormwater through in-pipe storage to more aggressive concepts like what is being instituted in parts of the country where municipalities have begun onsite treatment of stormwater or discharge to the WWTP, to control storm systems and BMPs subject to loadings from cross connections, homeless, excessive sprinkler systems, car washing, pool discharges, in addition WWF.  CSO systems have already been developed to address the storage concepts and high-rate intermittent treatment necessary to remove storm flow pollutants.  The goal will be to maximize the treatment capacity of the existing systems. Different technologies originally done for CSO control that could be evaluated for this topic area are: storage with bleed back to WWTP for treatment during low-flow periods; swirl/vortex separators with underflow discharged to sanitary system; street storage with regulator modification; and determining effective rates of catch basin cleaning for storm drainage systems. 
	
	6)	New urban areas or upstream additions to older combined sewer system (CSS), especially highly impervious areas, will be better off using advanced designs concepts requiring larger diameter sewers to add storage capacity to the system.  Steeper-sloped sewers with more effective bottom cross-sections will alleviate, or possibly eliminate, antecedent DWF pollutant deposition by maintaining flushing velocity and will result in reduction of concentrated storm flushes (sometimes referred to as first flush).  The additional cost of an advanced CSS would be incrementally small considering overall cost of installing a conventional CSS or a two-pipe separate (storm and sanitary) sewer system, and cost effectiveness for storm-flow pollution control.  The use and continued installation of CSS is an acceptable practice in foreign countries, e.g., Germany, Japan and Switzerland. Interest in CSS for new development gets added impetus when the adverse water quality impact of stormwater runoff is considered.  With a CSS, at least some of the runoff would be captured and routed through treatment before release into the receiving waters.  In southern Germany, CSSs are being designed with state-of-the-art upland BMPs for stormwater attenuation to reduce the volume of stormwater entering the system.  With reduced stormwater input of upland practices like low impact development (LID), rainwater harvesting (i.e., cisterns and rain barrels) and other BMPs, the number and volume of overflows are reduced over a traditional "old-fashioned" CSO, thus only discharging CSO during large, infrequent events, when the receiving water is most likely to be at high flow conditions also.  In addition, designing WWTP that service a CSS to include treatment of CSO, and not just treatment for peak DWF conditions would reduce overall polluted discharges.  This project topic would look at these and other potential advances to sewer design to minimize pollution removal.  Providing evidence that combined sewer advances will reduce pollution rather discharging untreated stormwater may assist watershed managers in their choice of alternatives to address TMDLs. 
	
	Tasks 1-4 for each Project Topic 
		
	Task 1: Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)
	The contractor shall comply with all requirements as delineated in Attachment 1 “NRMRL QA Requirements and Definitions”.  The EPA requires a quality assurance narrative statement.

The QAPP shall contain the data collection strategy and target ending date in relation to the QAPP approval. 
	
	The QAPP for sampling and analysis shall address the long term maintenance and calibration requirements or real-time monitoring equipment.  The QAPP requires a schedule of sampling and monitoring equipment checks and calibrations so that all events can be monitored.  The emphasis on the QAPP shall be to determine the amount of samples to develop statistically valid results.  Graphs and equations are available in Chapter Five of “Stormwater Effects Handbook: A Toolbox for Watershed Managers, Scientist, and Engineers,” by G. A. Burton, Jr. and R. E.

3)	Magnifications:  5X, 10X, and 20X
4)	Working distance: at least 20 mm at 20X magnification
5)	Field of view (LxW): at least 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm at 20X magnification
6)	Focus resolution:  plus or minus 5 nm or better
7)	Operating modes: phase-shifting interferometry and vertical scanning interferometery
8)	Adjustable optics:  total optical path length, wavefront curvature, and dispersion of the reference arm must be adjustable to match the sample arm of the interferometer with the various objectives, as well as when an intervening window (up to 8 mm optical quality glass) is in the sample arm path
9)	Camera: black and white CCD with remote video monitor
10)	Light source: software controlled/autosetting, white light or quasi-monochromatic
B.	Microscope control hardware and  image processing software 
1)	Control system compatible with NIST’s existing National Instruments based data acquisition and control system. This system includes a Dell Computer running Windows XP and NI LabView version 7.1. The system has two PCI slots and one PCI express slot available.
2)	I/O and video boards to operate the microscope in the specified modes.
3)	PC Windows XP  based image pattern matching software using subpixel interpolation
4)	PC Windows XP based image analysis software 
C.	Functional Requirements 
1)	Capture surface profile of a cantilever beam 300 micrometers long, 50 micrometers wide and 2 micrometers thick that is deflected by 2 micrometers at its free end. Must be able to output surface contour maps at 10 Hz update rate.
2)	Output average deflection of a user specified sub-area at 100 Hz.

Deliverables:

Upon award of a purchase order resulting from this solicitation, the Government requires the following efforts (Vendors quotation shall include proposed periods of performance for the following):

1) Design Phase (see clause entitled “Design Review and Approval by the Government”):  The contractor shall prepare all necessary design documents (including conceptual layout drawing of the profiler installed in the vacuum chamber, block diagrams of all equipment interfaces, physical drawings with adequate detail to enable NIST to create the mounting fixture for the microscope (see GFP below), a list of materials and components, and a schedule to produce the system for delivery to NIST). 

2) Manufacturing Phase: The contractor shall manufacture and deliver the optical profiler in accordance with the stated specifications and the approved design documents.

Government Furnished Property

1)	Vacuum compatible mounting fixture for microscope, hereafter referred to as the microscope mount. NIST will utilize the required design documents to design and fabricate the microscope mount.  A drawing of the microscope mount will be released to the vendor within 30 days following approval of the design documents as described above for informational purposes only.
2)	Data acquisition computer (Dell Computer running Windows XP and NI LabView version 7.1, two PCI slots and one PCI express slot available)

*** Installation/Training/Warranty

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up* and one (1) training session for up to two (2) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation/set-up and demonstration of performance specifications (as described below), but shall be completed no later than 30 days after delivery.  

* Vendor shall deliver the optical profiler system (interference microscope, I/O boards, and control and imaging software) with the interference microscope ready to be attached to the microscope mount in the NIST vacuum chamber.  Because of the delicate nature of the instruments that the optical profiler must be mounted to in the vacuum chamber, NIST personnel will be responsible for physically mounting the microscope in the vacuum system. NIST expects a vendor representative to be present during this installation, and expects that the vendor will complete all other aspects of the installation, including the appropriate computer hardware and software, and all necessary electrical connections. NIST personnel will be available to help with the installation, but will assume no liability for damages to vendor instrument that might occur due to mishandling during installation.  For its part, NIST must complete the attachment of the microscope to the mount within 30 days after delivery of the instrument.

2.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.  ***

*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.  Performance of the system shall be verified first at ambient conditions using vertical step height standards of 1.8, 8, and 24 micrometers height. Vendor must demonstrate that the calibrated system can accurately measure step heights on the order of 5 micrometers to within 1 percent relative uncertainty (plus or minus 50 nm) and also demonstrate the ability to output surface profile data at the requested 10 Hz rate, and to track the displacement of a user defined sub-region at a rate up to 100 Hz.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation, items being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA  intends to acquire following items: Item#1 quantity of 5 each Wildlife Computers MK10-AF Fast-GPS, location and dive data recorder or equivalent. Must compute locations based on <1 second of reception of GPS signals, with location accuracy of <20 m.  Must provide record of seal haul-out status or proportions at 1-hour resolution.  Must provide summaries of dive behavior as histograms of depth and duration, or dive-by-dive data on maximum depth and duration.  Must have sufficient battery life to provide 100,000 Argos transmissions at 0.5W radiated power.  To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: a.Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water. c.Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month. b.Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day. d. Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view e.Recognize whether the animal is at-sea or hauled-out, and transmit at the appropriate rates. Argos permits a maximum of one transmission every 45 seconds when the animal is at-sea, and one transmission every 90 seconds when the animal is hauled out. f. Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for a user-defined number of hours. The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 1000 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components, and be abraded on the bottom surface for adhesion to quick-setting epoxy, used to attach the SDR to a seal’s pelage. Item#2 quantity of 14 each Wildlife Computers SPOT5, Flipper-tag mounted location and haul-out recorder or equivalent. This tag must be very small (maximum mass of 60 g in air, maximum dimensions of 80mm [L] x 19.5mm [W] x 10.5mm [H], antenna length 20 cm), and permanently affixed to a Temple Original animal tag (www.templetag.com), which is the means for attaching the recorder to a seal’s hind flipper. The unit must have sufficient battery capacity for 10,000 Argos transmissions at 0.5W radiated power. To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must:a.Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water.b.Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month. c.Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day.d. Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when a satellite is likely to be in view. The SDR must record, calculate, and transmit daily “percentage haul-out timelines” indicating the percent of time during each hour that the SDR’s wet/dry sensor is out of the water.  Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system. The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 500 m of water. All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through software at no additional charge that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system. Item 3: quantity of 14 each Wildlife Computers Splash 1XC tag,  ARGOS location, dive, and haul-out recorder or equivalent. This recorder must be small (i.e., maximum mass in air of 250 g, 165mm [L] x 39.5mm [W] x 34mm [H]), but it must have sufficient battery life to provide 100,000 Argos transmissions at 0.5W radiated power.  To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: a.Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water. b. Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month. c. Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day. 
d. Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view.
e.Recognize whether the animal is at-sea or hauled-out, and transmit at the appropriate rates. Argos permits a maximum of one transmission every 45 seconds when the animal is at-sea, and one transmission every 90 seconds when the animal is hauled out. f.Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for a user-defined number of hours. The SDR must collect data on depth (1 m resolution), temperature, light levels, and wet/dry periods, and summarize them into compressed histograms for transmission through the Argos system.  The numbers of bins (up to 14 per histogram), the bin cut-points, the period of coverage (1-24 hours), and the starting time of each histogram must be user programmable.  The SDR must provide, at a minimum, the following types of data messages, selectable by the user: 1. Dive duration histograms: Number of dives within the specified dive duration ranges. 2. Maximum dive depth histograms: Number of dives whose maximum depth is within the specified depth ranges. 3.Time-at-depth histograms: Time spent within the specified depth ranges. 4.Time-at-temperature histograms: Time spent within the specified temperature range. 5.Percentage timelines: What percentage of the hour the tag was above a user-specified threshold depth, or dry.  6.Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system. Because the behavior of diving animals limits access to the Argos satellite system, the SDR must provide the option of condensing multiple data messages into a single transmission to increase data throughput. Transmissions must include status messages at user-programmable intervals for battery voltage, the number of transmissions sent, the current zero-pressure offset value, the current time according to the internal clock, and seawater conductivity. The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 1000 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components, and be abraded on the bottom surface for adhesion to quick-setting epoxy, used to attach the SDR to a seal’s pelage. All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through software at no additional charge that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system. Only firms that can provide the exact or equivalent ARGOS satellite –linked data recorders described herein will be considered. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 526-6025 attention to Maria Mendoza. This is a simplified acquisition with the estimated value of less than $100,000.00.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:  Dell desktop computers are required to provide the reliability and functionality required by the Office of Overseas Building Operations.  The equipment is for use in the OBO Community and is used by multiple personnel constantly.  Dell is one of the main computer equipment manufacturers and is known for reliability, functionality, cost effectiveness and maintainability improved through R&D. OBO/IM/NOMB has diligently researched three major computer companies with the following criteria - Cost, reliability, CPU speed, CPU manufacturer, CPU configuration, memory, memory expansion, bus speed, video memory, video speed, display size, display dps, ), maintainability (R&D), and reliability. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The R&D portion is important as this saves man-hours in maintenance and repair times.  The Dell equipment is approved by Diplomatic Security for both for standalone use and for Main State SDI use.  If other than the specific Dell desktops required are procured, there will likely be functionality issues in various individual divisions which will result in the division procuring the equipment a second time to get the functionality and reliability they require.  The cost savings are in man-hours for M & R, functionality, speed, and upgradability.  Not meeting the above wastes man-hours and budget. No Remanufactured, No Refrubished equipment is acceptable.  New only. CHANGED CONFIGURATION CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov.

Please note that any such evaluation criteria must be articulated in the solicitation to the extent required by such regulations and/or guidelines.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective vendors, provide clarifications to the specifications and correct a typographical error.

Question 1:  Paragraph 4.2 states “The arrays shall meet the requirement of this specification during continuous exposure to any combination herein”, it follows that the requirements of 4.2.1 (modified by amendment 3) are to be used to show compliance with all performance requirements, including BOL and EOL power requirements.  Is it your intent that the arrays provide the power output values of 1000 W BOL and 800 W EOL stated in 3.3.1.2 at 120 degrees Celsius? Or is there some limited set of conditions under which the array is expected to experience 120 degrees Celsius (such as the week period spent between the insertion orbit and operational orbit) and/or lower power output requirement by the bus during the 120 degrees Celsius exposure? Answer 1:  The solar cells manufactured for Standard Bus shall have the beginning of life (BOL) performance characteristics listed in the following paragraphs when tested at 28 degrees Celsius, under illumination stimulating the spectrum and intensity of one sun, Air Mass Zero (AM0).  All BOL and EOL calculations should be based on the environmental conditions listed above.  Question 2:  Paragraph 4.2.1 (modified) states “maintained at any temperature between -150 degrees Celsius and +105 degrees Celsius +120 degrees Celsius for prototype testing and on-orbit operations in the deployed configurations”.  This implies that the prototype test temp is the same as the on-orbit operations temp (i.e. no margin) is this your intent? Or is the 120 degrees Celsius max temp intended to be a test temperature with margin over the on-orbit temp?  Answer 2:  The protoflight testing temperatures are -150 degrees Celsius and +120 degrees Celsius. The protoflight temperatures include margin from our predicted temperatures.  Question 3:  Para 7.2.5.5.1 states “Protoflight level tests shall consist of N cycles to a maximum temperature of +105 degrees Celsius +120 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of -150 degrees Celsius as shown in Figure 5 6.  But Figure 6 still shows 105 degrees Celsius as the max temp. Is that intentional? Also, paragraph 7.2.5.5.1 uses the term protoflight, but paragraph 4.2.1 uses the term prototype. Are those intended to be interchangeable?  Answer 3:  There is an error in Figure 6. It should state a max temperature of +120 degrees Celsius. There is also a typographical error in paragraph 4.2.1.  It should state protoflight instead of prototype.

13. Question:  Does this project have Federal Prevailing Wage Requirements?

Answer:   No

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

14. Question:  Are there time constraints on how long a tractor trailer can remain at the dock?

Answer:  Yes, trucks may only stay at the dock for the time that it takes to unload that trailer.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

15. Question:  Are there any special work times or will standard eight hour work days be ok?

Answer:  Work will take place during regular facility hours – 6:00am -3:30pm.

20. Question: 	The verbiage states that the shelving shall be constructed in accordance with NARA’s FRC shelving drawing #1 (attached).  I find no attachments to this solicitation.  Can you tell me where I can access this drawing?   

Answer:  Drawing attached.

21. Question:  Table 1 shows CF capacity ranging from 125,000 to 240,000.  What does this mean?  Is this # /cubic foot?   

Answer:  The capacity refers to how many standard-size records storage boxes, size 10” deep x 12” wide x 15” long, will fit on the shelves specified for each bay.  One cubic foot equals one standard box.  NARA stores 6 boxes on each 30” x 42” shelf; therefore a  primary shelving unit at 159” high would hold 84 cubic feet (boxes), and a primary shelving  unit at 135” high would hold 72 cubic feet (boxes).

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

22.  Question:  The verbiage states “ PRIMARY” and “FILL OUT” shelving units, showing different shelf sizes.  What do you mean by primary and fill out?  Are you meaning starter units and adder units?  

Answer:  Primary units with 30” x 42” shelves are NARA’s standard size.  However, to maximize capacity at the end of rows and around obstructions, NARA also uses smaller “fill-out” shelf sizes.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

23. Question:  Is there a layout drawing available? 

Answer:  See 20 above.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

Answer:  See 20 above.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

25. Question:  Will you want the post anchored?

Answer:   Anchoring is not required.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

26.  Question:  Are we to quote all 4 Bays, or just Bay 1 for now?   Also, are we to include installation for all four bays, or just the first bay?  Is the quote due on July 15th?   

Answer:  Bidders are requested to quote for all 4 Bays.  All bids should include installation for each bay.

Change to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None

Chang to Combined synopsis/solicitation:  None.

28. Question:  What is the maximum amount of time (days) to be taken by NARA from bid date to award.

Answer:  Awardee will be notified of award at the end of the evaluation process. Notification of the award will also be provided to unsuccessful offerors.

Change to Combine synopsis/solicitation: None.

Each pulpit ladder has as its base rigid guide rollers on the sides of the four corners, which roll along the 42-inch wide shelving base closures, 2-inches above the floor surface, for smooth movement of the ladder in order not to bump and damage the shelved records.  All shelving base closures must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the shelving unit, at both ends.  The units will not become dislodged by the four guide rollers of the aluminum pulpit ladders during their movement in the aisles while servicing the stored records, or by common impact forces within the storage space.
