<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals under full and open competition procedures from offerors having the capability to carry out clinical studies to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of new medications for the treatment of substance use disorders. As medications are often taken with other treatment drugs or drugs of abuse (such as but not limited to cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.), information on the extent and nature of the interaction between the medications and other treatment drugs/drugs of abuse will also be a focus of this contract. Such studies require the intravenous administration of drugs to human subjects.
<p>The data obtained will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and New Drug Applications (NDAs). All studies must be carried out under pertinent FDA regulations, such as Current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) and current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations. The successful contractor shall follow pertinent FDA guidelines/guidance.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that the successful offeror shall demonstrate possession of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Research Registration for Schedules II to V, and shall demonstrate either possession of or ability to obtain a DEA Research Registration for Schedule I controlled substances. The successful offeror must have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) currently accepted and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) or demonstrate that it has submitted to OHRP for issuance of an Assurance. The successful offeror must comply with the requirements in the HHS Protection of Human Subjects regulations at 45 CFR 46 and must have a board-certified physician on the project.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of a single, five-year, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contract. NIDA anticipates awarding fixed price and/or cost reimbursement task orders as needed throughout the period of performance to maintain flexibility in issuing work. This award is a competitive renewal of Contract No. HHSN271201200018C, titled "Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Studies for Medications Development."</p>
<p>RFP No. N01DA-17-8935 will be available electronically on or about 15 days from the date of this posting. You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website (URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due 45 days from the release date. NIDA anticipates a September 2017 award date. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons or organizations may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION <br />The United States Army, Regional Contracting Office, Erbil is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest, the resources, and capability to competitively deliver a wide variety of items in a broad class of supplies and perform services required in support of the U.S. mission in Iraq (Operation Inherent Resolve - OIR) and Afghanistan (Operation New Dawn - OND).</p>
<p>Place of Performance: Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, and other locations within CENTCOM.</p>
<p>The containerized systems we are interested in acquiring are:</p>
<p>&bull;Incinerators<br />&bull;Energy generation and grid inter-connectivity <br />&bull;Waste compaction<br />&bull;Waste volume reduction (shredder/chipper/crushers)<br />&bull;Waste water treatment<br />&bull;Water purification - TWPS<br />&bull;Re-use of plastics/wood for extruded lumber products or concrete aggregate<br />&bull;Bio-fuel (TGRS 2.0)<br />&bull;Hazardous Waste<br />&bull;Recycling and Sorting<br />&bull;Composting</p>
<p><br />The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes.

NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.<br />PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>There have been request to investigate waste and utilities management solutions for contingency operating environments. Ideally, this would be a series of packaged modules commercial systems that will enable all waste processing to remain within the Army's footprint and control and potentially provides returns to the Army in the form of budget reduction, energy production or products required for base support. This option is preferred to contracting out waste management to a local company where the Army would lose the ability for easy oversight and insurance that the waste is being properly disposed of. Additionally, many of the systems available are commercially sized, complicated to use, and not readily mobile as the Army mission may demand. This initiative follows the Army's goals of sustainable basing and energy reduction.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Government requires (see below criteria). The intent of this Sources Sought is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in (see below criteria) products that could be applied to meet this requirement. The Government envisions a solution for utility containers that meets the following operational and program requirements:</p>
<p>1.Must fit in or be a standard container size - primary: 20' foot or Tricon/Quadcon, secondary: 40' container.</p>
<p>2.Must be able to be scaled by adding additional modules as necessary.</p>
<p>3.Systems of the same nature should be interoperable in the event that the need increases at a specific location.</p>
<p>4.By-products of processing should not produce additional handling or disposal concerns. I.e. waste water effluent should be clean enough to release directly into the environment or be used by the base in some capacity.</p>
<p>5.Must have all necessary components to work on any power type or connection (US or British, 50/60 hz, commercial or tactical generators, batteries, or prime power).</p>
<p>6.All control systems should be integrated into the container<br />7.Each module should be plug and play with the others and customer should be able to choose which modules fit their needs best.</p>
<p>8.Each system should be standalone capable for controls and processing - outputs should not require further processing to be safe for disposal.</p>
<p>9.Be able to set up and operating within 72 hours of download and be packed up for transport within 96 hours.</p>
<p>10.Must have relatively simple maintenance requirements that is conducive to a deployed atmosphere</p>
<p>11.20' units should be able to be flown by a C-130, smaller units should be able to be sling-loaded by a CH-47 with integrated attachment points for palletizing or sling load.</p>
<p>Maintenance, Inspection and Repair. The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level. The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.</p>
