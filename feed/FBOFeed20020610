<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Subsurface Protection and Remediation Division, located at the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center in Ada, Ok intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Geoprobe Systems under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a soil probe unit. This unit is required for a complete range of tasks for our direct push (DP) equipment.  Our current equipment is only designed to work on dry compacted soil areas.  As we move into research where the access to marshy and frequently submerged areas continues, we need a means of actually instrumenting and sampling these areas without damaging them environmentally.  This unit is designed to install on the vibration isolated steel plate in the back of our currently on order Hydrotraxx unit.  Because of the weight sensitive nature of the Hydrotraxx, Geoprobe will design a special unit that will meet our exploratory and site characterization needs without compromising the wetland and water travel capabilities of the Hydrotraxx all-terrain vehicle.   We undertook an extensive market survey last year to identify an all-terrain vehicle capable of using push tools driven hydraulically for subsurface site characterization work.  The Hydrotraxx unit was the only unit capable of doing this work and was purchased.  To purchase a push tool to mount on the Hydrotraxx other than a Geoprobe would be prohibitive in terms of the need for additional accessory tools. This unit needs to be able to easily use all of the Geoprobe accessories that we have in our suite of specialized tools, we currently have four (4) Geoprobe units. This is the only responsible source, and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Gia Chanturia, President, Georgian International Oil Corporation, 
c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Georgia Underground Gas Storage Project.
The Georgian International Oil Corporation (GIOC) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for an underground gas storage facility for the country of Georgia.

Improving the reliability of gas supply has been a goal of Georgia since the early 1990's. It is viewed as being critical to providing reliable electricity in Georgia during the late autumn and winter months, when hydropower resources are low. Prior to the breakup of the USSR, the Caucasus republics operated as a part of a unified gas supply grid that was dispatched from Moscow. The grid supplied substantial amounts of gas from Russia during the autumn and winter to the gas fired power plants in the Caucasus. The value of gas energy was returned during the spring and summer months, when there was surplus hydropower capacity in the Caucasus. For a variety of reasons the Russians are no longer eager to continue this trade, and Georgia, in particular, has suffered severe power shortages during the colder months as a result.

Because there is no storage available in Georgia, its gas consumers have been forced to accept erratic service and high prices for the Russian gas. The development of the gas storage project will not only insulate Georgia from disruptions in gas supply, it will enable Georgia to purchase gas during the summer months when the price is lowest. It will also allow Georgia to regulate its hydropower generation so that it may sell power at peak hours to its neighbors, which will yield a higher price. Ultimately, the savings in fuel costs and the improved cash flow from peak load power sales will result in lower electricity prices for Georgian consumers. The building of gas storage facilities should substantially improve Georgia's energy security and lower the price its consumers must pay for electricity. Azerbaijan will also receive similar economic benefits, but to a lesser degree. 

The Georgian government is interested in developing both short term and seasonal reserves for natural gas. The principal objectives of the storage facilities are: 
1.	Minimizing the adverse impacts from disruption of gas deliveries from abroad;
2.	Improving the security of natural gas transportation in the Caucasus Region; and 
3.	Optimizing the economic value of natural gas received through the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCP). 

The storage facilities are expected to operate as an integral part of the SCP, which will connect the Shah Deniz gas fields in Azerbaijan with Erzurum in Turkey. 

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $683,000 grant to GIOC from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to GIOC c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M. July 18, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  GIOC reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  GIOC also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  GIOC is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES - 

The Office of Acquisition Management has established a competitive technical assistance (CAP) program limited to participation by Minority Institutions of Higher Education (MIHE) which include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)*, Hispanic Serving Institutions*, American Indian Serving Institutions*, Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions*, and other postsecondary minority institutions as defined under The Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended) [20 U.S.C.?1135 d-5].    The purpose of this program is to foster MIHE participation in research and development activities that contribute substantially to the Federal Highway Administration?s (FHWA) mission and to help prepare the faculty and students at MIHE?s to successfully participate in the competitive research arena.  The program is established in accordance with Section 5001 (a)(1) of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), and authority to enter into awards with MIHE?s is granted at: 23 U.S.C. ?403; 49 CFR ?1.48; and Executive Orders 13021, 13125, 13230, and 13256.

*HBCU is defined at 34 CFR ?608.2 as an accredited college or university, established prior to 1964, whose principle mission was and is, the education of African-Americans. 

*Indian Serving Institution, which includes Tribal Colleges, as well as Bureau of Indian Affairs affiliated institutions is defined at 34 CFR ?410.2.

*Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) is defined at 34 CFR ?606.2.

*Native Hawaiian Serving Institution is defined at 20 U.S.C.?1135 d-5(3).

A minimum of 20 percent cost sharing by the recipient is a requirement under this initiative.

All awards made under this program will be relevant to one or more of the FHWA?s five strategic goals of mobility, safety, productivity, human and natural environment, and national security.  The MOBILITY goal concerns the continual improvement of the public?s access to activities, goods, and services through the preservation, improvement, and expansion of the highway transportation system and enhancement of its operations, efficiency, and intermodal connections.  The SAFETY goal concerns continual improvement of highway safety by reducing the number of fatalities and injuries.  The PRODUCTIVITY goal concerns the continual improvement of the economic efficiency of the Nation?s transportation system to enhance America?s position in the global economy.  The HUMAN AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT goal concerns the protection and enhancement of the natural environment and communities affected by highway transportation.  The NATIONAL SECURITY goal seeks the improvement of the capacity and operation of the highway system to support defense mobilization.  Our strategic plan recognizes the inherent nature of cross-cutting goals, under which success in one area flows directly to success under a second or third goal.  As such, our Corporate Management Strategies that embody the principles contained in the Quality Journey, provide the overarching framework that will enable us to achieve our vision under all goals.

On or about April 4, 2002, the FHWA will issue a Request for Applications (RFA) for its Fiscal Year 2002 program.  The solicitation will include specific projects for consideration.  Eligible offerors will be invited to submit applications for one or more of the projects.  

THE RFA WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY AT: http://www.eps.gov UNDER DOT/FHWA. 

It is the applicant?s responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of the RFA and amendments (if any).  Potential applicants will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFA and amendments (if any).

<CONTACT>ANGELA S. THOMPSON, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513/487-2005, E-Mail: thompson.angie@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply and Water Resources Division (WSWRD), Cincinnati, OH, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with BIO-RAD Life Science Group under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, for the procurement of a Pulse Field Electrophoresis System.  The WSWRD conducts research to support regulations for watershed TMDLs and to develop strategies for controlling waterborne fecal contaminants. Accurate microbiological characterization in watersheds is paramount to safe recreational waters. Nucleic acid based techniques are being applied to watersheds to monitor sources of fecal pollution. Several of these techniques depend on generating DNA band patterns that are in turn used as fingerprints of both bacterial isolates and whole microbial communities. WSWRD scientists are currently developing new 16S rDNA methods based on the generation of nucleic acid fingerprints.   In essence, several of these methods consist in the analysis of band patterns using agarose and polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The latter approach is considered a phylogenetic typing method. In order to evaluate the sensitivity and resolution of new techniques, it is necessary to compare them to the restriction digest analysis of bacterial genomic DNA fragments separated via Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE is the current standard in bacterial subtyping approach and as a consequence will be used in ongoing research to characterize environmental isolates, including pathogens, from watershed impacted with fecal contamination as well as from drinking water systems.      We have identified a two component PFGE system capable of generating fingerprints for indicatorbacteria in a fast, accurate, and reproducible manner. This package is available through BioRad Inc., and the components that we require are the CHEF Mapper XA and the Gel Doc 2000. The CHEF Mapper includes internally programmed conditions for optimizing separation of DNA between any two DNA fragment sizes between 100 bp to 10 Mbp. Therefore, the CHEF-Mapper allows greater flexibility in the development of electrophoretic separation  conditions and nonlinear ramping. After electrophoresis, the gels are stained with fluorescent dye (e.g., ethidium bromide), and PFGE patterns are digitized in a TIFF format (uncompressed .tif file) by using a Gel-Doc 2000.  This system is used in clinical and academic settings.  Furthermore, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) uses a similar system to monitor outbreaks (e.g.,) and to create the databases that we will use in bacterial subtyping studies. In order to generate data that can be compared with the scientific literature and with the efforts from other laboratories we need to acquire a system that is compatible with the databases generated by CDC.   We have reviewed the scientific literature and by far the BioRad systems are the mostly used for microbial subtyping.  The primary reason is the fact that they provide two component system capable of performing the DNA fragment separation and the analysis simultaneously.  This system will be primarily used as part of the source tracking research performed by MCCB scientists.  However, PFGE methods are applicable to a number of areas pertaining to the microbial examination of water systems via molecular techniques.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Water Supply Water Resources Div. (WSWRD), Edison. The contractor will develop a field scale, process-based simulation tool for design, performance planning, and evaluation of common construction site best management practices (BMP).  It is a process-based risk management approach to soil erosion and sediment transport control at construction sites.  The EPA considers soil erosion and sediment transport from construction sites larger than 5 acres in urban lands as statutory point sources and  regulated these sites under Phase I of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  EPA, under Phase II of the NPDES program (mandatory, 3/10/2003), requires permits for sites 1 acre and larger.  The States are taking measures to address construction site erosion control.  Results  from these programs will help develop technical guidance for tracking and evaluating erosion control measures at construction sites across the nation (e.g., USEPA 2001).  The EPA needs a process-based model to predict the performance of the common, small-scale, construction site BMPs, covered under  Phase II, namely, filter fences, rolled erosion control systems or similar practices.  The model calibrated under field conditions can be initially used as a simulation tool to select among alternative designs under  a more extensive set of conditions than could be tested empirically.  These  modeled BMP performance scenarios can be used to provide state of the practice BMP standards and specifications for silt fence and rolled erosion systems.  The standards would cover material types, methods for limiting slope lengths, drainage areas, quantifying additional design parameters, and  guidance for installation and maintenance.  A design aid is required that would be a more user friendly extension of the process-based model as a spreadsheet model that would include algorithms and appropriate steps for predicting site-specific design parameters such as those listed by Fitfield  (2001) that would be used to specify final designs and maintenance.  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  This procurement will be processed under FAR 13 (simplified acquisition procedures). The SIC is 541990.  it is anticipated that a request for quotations shall be issued on 7/2/02,  with quotes due 7/16/02.  All interested small businesses should submit a request to Angela Thompson, using the following methods:  (1) In writing to the above address, (2) by fax (513/487-2107) or by E-mail (tompson.angie@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-02-00190.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, ORD, National Risk Management Research Lab., Sustainable Technology Div., Cincinnati, OH, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with YSI, Incorporated-Fondriest Environmental under the authority of FAR 6.302-1,  for the procurement of a Multiparameter Sonde System.  The sondes are equipped with sensors for various chemical or physical parameters.  These sensors are field replaceable.  Pulsed dissolved oxygen and light on-off duty turbidity sensing is the best method of measurement for these parameters. The YSI patented "Rapid Pulse" oxygen system does not require external stirring.  it adheres approved methods and is based on the principles of the Clark membrane covered, polargraphic sensor that was developed in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Battery life is extended and errors caused by inadequate stirring are eliminated.  The sensor is not affected by passive biofoulants and had been shown to perform well for several weeks of monitoring without calibration in the turbid waters that are common in the till plain region of the Little Miami River Watershed.  This patented   technology is only available from YSI.   Local and relatively easy access to customer support is also an important factor to the field team because these sondes take a lot of abuse when placed in the stream, and we must have ready access to informed technicians and parts so as to maintain contiguous monitoring for the different sampling periods, which will include storms. This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit requisite technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541512        The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is responsible for performing analyzes of future air pollution impacts over the United States and recommending strategies for mitigating the predicted impacts.  The next series of analyses will require a much more powerful computer system for processing computationally intensive numerical models that simulate meteorological, pollutant emission, photochemical, and transport processes in the North American atmosphere.  Also there is a need to be able to run these processes  whenever needed.  These processes can take a long time to run and therefore many of these applications will have to be executing concurrently if results are to be analyzed in a timely manner.  For these reasons, EPA's current requirement is to have one master node where many users can log onto and  have access to many computer CPUs.  It has been determined that a custom-built Linux-based Cluster System would meet our computing needs for these future analyses.  The purpose of the master would be for load-balancing or the proper allocation of single-threaded applications (as opposed to  parallel-processing where one job is distributed over several CPUs).  The schematic for the cluster system will be provided in the Request for Quotation (RFQ).          NAICS Code 541512 applies and the size standard is $21 million in average annual receipts over the last three years.  It is  estimated that the RFQ will be issued approximately 15 days after the date of this notice, as a total small business set aside action.  Quotes will be due approximately five (5) days after the RFQ issuance date.  The complete Statement of Work (SOW)/System Description, Request for Quotation  (RFQ)and any RFQ amendments will be available via the Internet at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the SOW and RFQ via the Internet.  If you will be obtaining a copy of the RFQ via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the  RFQ is posted for any  amendments.  Firms who do not have the capability to obtain the documents from the Internet, may submit a written request for a FAX copy of the SOW and RFQ from the contact point at the address above; however, only those firms who do NOT have the capability to obtain  documents from the Internet should request a FAX.  FAXes will not be sent to those firms who have Internet access.  If you request a FAX of the RFQ, you will receive amendments by mail, unless you notify us otherwise.  Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.  Only one copy will be FAXed to  a corporate entity, regardless of the number of requests from one or more different geographic locations.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>THIS WILL BE A COMBINED SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION 

STATEMENT OF WORK

Conduct and Independent Analysis and Validation of Information Resources Management Organization Structure, Staffing, and Mission, and Work Assignments and Recommend Any Necessary Changes and Improvements Necessary to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Rural Development Information Resource Management and Information Technology Support Programs

1.0	General

1.1	Background

Information technology (IT) in both the private and public sectors has undergone a significant transformation within the past several years which has expanded and altered the type of automation support activities now delivered by organizations assigned this responsibility.  The emergence of web-based applications and systems has expanded automation support activities by emphasizing the need for increased telecommunications capabilities and improved security processes to protect information assets.  The deployment of mainframe applications has been superceded with the design, development, and implementation of web-centric applications hosted on servers.  Organizational constructs such as ?web farms? have been introduced.  New automation technologies have been introduced such as firewalls, intrusion detection, public key identification (PKI), electronic data interchange (EDI), data warehouses/data marts, imaging and workflow management, fully automated call centers, automated mail handling, and many others.  New software tools have been introduced which has and continues to alter the landscape of IT organizations as they struggle to keep pace with the accelerating availability of new automation technology.  Organizational structures that, in the past, supported a mainframe environment and a limited array of tools, operating systems, and data base management systems are no longer effective to responding to the automation support demands of today.

In addition to this technical evolution, congressional mandates have emerged that require government agencies to better plan and manage IT capital investments.  IT managers must now be knowledgeable in financial management concepts such as the computation of present values, pay-back period computations, and the computation of return on investment.  Performance goals must be defined and measured continually throughout the life of an investment.  The Department of Agriculture has developed and deployed an Information Technology Investment Planning System (ITIPS) to monitor the performance of agencies in the accomplishment of all capital planning activities.  Annual reporting and review processes are coordinated through the Department with the Office of Management and Budget.  These new capital planning activities have been absorbed by IRM but not efficiently integrated into the organization.

Over the past several years, like most organizations within the federal government, the Information Resources Management organization has been impacted by staffing cuts and decreased budget allocations.  In some divisions and branches reductions in supervisory staff has increased supervisory-to-employee ratios above 25 to 1 while other parts of the IRM organization experience significantly lower ratios. Although this allows IRM to maintain an overall acceptable ratio, realignment of managerial and supervisory ratios is imperative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managers in IRM divisions and branches with the extremely high ratios. Secondly, as a result of hiring restrictions and budgetary limitations, the IRM organization has been unable to transform itself to keep pace with the changing technical environment as well as the emerging legislative and Departmental mandates impacting on its mission.  New mission and work assignments have been made to divisions and branches based on the availability of personnel and not necessarily on assigned mission.  This has resulted in much overlapping of work assignments and conflictsin carrying out assigned missions. Thirdly, the reduction in staff has caused many tasks performed within IRM that are directed to monitoring and improving IRM efficiency and effectiveness have been abandoned and the performance of other tasks has been reduced in frequency.   Some examples of such tasks include the constant monitoring and analysis of cost reports related to National Information Technology Center billings, strategic IRM planning efforts,  and the analysis of National Finance Center costs.
 

1.2 Objective

This Statement of Work (SOW) is directed toward the completion of an analysis of the current organizational and staffing make up of Rural Development?s Information Resources Management organization.  This includes the development of recommendations that will allow the Agency to build an IT organization better able to provide the automation support required by the Agency and better positioned to meet the ever changing automation technologies that are rapidly emerging through out the industry.


1.3	Scope

The Agency requires the analysis of current mission responsibilities and workload assignments throughout the IRM organization both in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Mo.  The organization structure of the Rural Development IRM should be studied, evaluated, and compared to the structure in other government agencies and in private industry.  Recommendations for organizational and staffing changes should be based on an assessment of ?best practices? throughout the IT community.  Interviews of key IRM managers including the Chief Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, all division directors, and selected branch chiefs should be conducted.

The Agency requires this analysis and the resulting recommendations in order to effect changes in the IRM organization that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automation support program throughout the Agency.


2.0	Description of Service

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for an enhancement to the HyperSizer commercial software that is utilized by NASA's Vehicle Analysis Branch to perform structural mass properties assessment, and design and structural analysis.  The program is PC based and is accessible via the Microsoft COM interface.  NASA requires enhancements to this program to make mass property determinations using load based template assignment to structural components.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the item from Collier Research and Development Corporation of Hampton, VA 23666, because Collier is the sole owner of the HyperSizer source code, and the COM interface of HyperSizer contains features known only to Collier.  The utilization of these features is essential in creating a product which can be used by NASA in its assessment of launch vehicle structural systems. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Pacific time on June 25, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Data derived will be used for compliance with the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Archeological Resource Protection Act to potential effects of heritage resources.  It is expected that more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.   The estimated quantity will be proportionately reduced depending on how may contracts will result from this solicitation.   The performance period is expected to be from August 1, 2002 or date of contract award through July 31, 2003 or one year from date of award with 4 consecutive option years.

DRAFT
Scope of Work
For Management of Computer Delivery
Purpose
The purpose of this agreement is to provide a vehicle for receiving, storing, testing, distributing, installing, training, maintaining, and monitoring use of donated computers from the U.S. to schools in Uzbekistan in the most sustainable manner feasible, and procuring additional equipment as detailed below to fill the balance. 
Background
This program was conceived in a discussion between DPM Azimov and Aministrator Natsios in November 2001, when Azimov requested that USAID assist in equipping schools with computers.  This request was repeated during high-level meetings at the Joint Security and Cooperation Consultations in January 2002. This request was agreed to by the U.S. delegation led by Ambassador Taylor.
Of nearly 10,000 schools in Uzbekistan, about half are equipped with computers. Only 1.2 percent of these schools have Pentium class computers, and about 7 percent have 386-486 computers. The rest have Soviet computers of some 20 years ago. Three percent of all students in Uzbekistan have access to computers in their schools. Due to the age of those computers and accompanying lack of spare parts, many of these computers are not in working order. The U.S. Government has agreed to donate and ship a number of used 110/240V computers and monitors with some extras, such as cables, from the United States to Uzbekistan.
This program supports a new priority of USAID on education and youth in Central Asia, and links with a larger-scale basic education initiative now in the design phase.
Period
Arrival of the computers in Tashkent is expected in late 2002. This agreement will begin one month prior to the expected arrival of the computers and continue for 8 more months (2 months distribution + 6 months maintenance & monitoring).
Program description
The primary purpose of this program is to transfer donated used computers from the US to primary and secondary schools in Uzbekistan in pursuit of familiarizing students with computer technology and use, and connecting them to the internet where feasible.
Pre-Arrival Activities
Several procedures will need be developed, approved by USAID, and acted upon before arrival of the equipment, including: an inventory format for the equipment that will record specific details regarding distribution and working condition of each individual piece of equipment over the life of this award; a distribution plan for beneficiary schools; a Beneficiary Agreement that includes policies and procedures to which those schools must adhere; a training plan for appropriate personnel at distribution sites upon installation; and a monitoring plan for the post-distribution phase. In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will also be expected to identify sources and price quotes for additional computers, monitors, and accessories, as well as introductory computer courses and materials, along with accessories, operating system, and software.
Proposals should include a mobilization plan for the first 60 days of the activity that covers all of the activities in this ?Pre-Arrival? section. This plan should take the form of a calendar with detailed information as to when and how these various logistical issues will be managed.
Inventory format:
The contractor will develop a format for inventory of the equipment that includes fields for serial numbers, working condition, date and location of distribution, memory capacity, operating system, software installed, and dates and descriptions of repairs. This inventory should be a living document from which repair, software installation, and distribution records can be kept through life of this activity. USAID will approve the format prior to arrival of the equipment.
Distribution Plan:
The contractor will assess which schools in which communities should be potential beneficiaries of these computers, what software will be necessary, and in what quantity. This assessment will be based upon electrical reliability in the community, security considerations, and the community?s ability and willingness to adhere to the Beneficiary Agreement (outlined below). The equipment should be concentrated in the areas where USAID is already active.
Based on its assessment, the contractor will provide USAID with various potential packages for distribution of the equipment, based on packing lists that will be provided upon shipment. The packages will include which schools get which equipment, keeping in mind that each school should receive at least one of the larger-memory CPUs. The packages should also include which schools will have reliable internet access, although non-availability of internet should not preclude a school?s receiving some equipment. USAID will actively participate in the formulation of this plan, and must approve the final version (with GOU input as necessary) before distribution can begin.
Procurement:
In the event that the U.S. Government is not able to fill the order of computers from its surplus stock, the contractor will be required to procure 110/220V Pentium II personal computers (no Macs) and 110/220Vcolor monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, cables, and power cords. The computers will have at least 16 MB RAM, .5 GB, and video cards. For the purposes of this proposal, bidders are to budget for 200 PCs, monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, power cords, and other necessary cords and cables. Procured items need not be new, but must be in good working order, and must fit the specification noted in this paragraph.
In addition, the contractor will identify sources and obtain quotes for necessary accessories, including 500 European plugs, and 1,000 sets of Cyrillic stickers for keyboards. The packing list will provide a more detailed picture of what this procurement may entail, but the contractor should budget according to these items for the purposes of this document. Once the packing list is received, the contractor will provide a report to USAID that outlines how many computers, monitors, UPS?s and other supplementary materials (cords, cables, etc.) will be needed before delivery and installation can begin.
In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will explore possibilities for special discounts that might be offered by local internet provider for schools, especially schools in poorer, rural areas of the country. The contractor should also explore the possibility of the GOU?s subsidizing this cost to schools, especially once the period of this award is completed.
The contractor will also identify and obtain price quotes for course materials that schools and teachers will use for various levels of computer courses. Depending upon what is already installed on the computers that we receive (assuming that some are educational), USAID will work with the contractor to decide which courses to procure.
All procurement will be undertaken in accordance with the USAID Eligibility Rules for Goods and Services (attached), and budgets should reflect costs accordingly.
Beneficiary Agreement:
The contractor will develop a Beneficiary Agreement that all beneficiary schools must sign in order to receive any equipment. This Beneficiary Agreement will be approved by USAID before distribution begins. In addition to the hard and fast rule that these computers are not for resale, this agreement will include the school?s commitment to:
allow appropriate teachers to attend training on the computers;  
install only licensed software on the computers;
allow students access to the internet (where internet is available) during most school days;
adhere to policies and procedures developed by the contractor and approved by USAID;
maintain equipment after this award?s maintenance period expires;
develop a system of user fees for non-student users that will cover costs of internet access during school hours. 
Training Plan:
The contractor will develop a 2-3 day course for appropriate school personnel at the distribution site to teach basic use and maintenance practices, including efficient use of the internet where appropriate. The training should also include a reiteration of the policies and procedures to which beneficiaries will adhere, how to start and sustain user fee systems, and should introduce identified course materials.
Monitoring Plan:
The contractor will develop a separate monitoring plan for the equipment to be carried out after distribution and installation. This plan will lay out travel to each of the beneficiary schools once a month to see first hand how the computers are being used, advise the school on other perhaps more advanced uses in their particular situations, and record and resolve any problems that may have occurred with the equipment. A form for each monitoring visit will be developed upon which to record these issues, along with any online partnerships with US or other schools and any webpages created at the school. This plan and accompanying form will be approved by USAID before distribution is complete. Mention of this plan should be made in the Beneficiary Agreement. 
All pre-arrival activities should be completed by the estimated time of arrival of the equipment.
Arrival and Pre-Distribution Activities
Shipment of the donated computers to Tashkent will be arranged by USAID/CAR. Upon its arrival in Tashkent, USAID will provide letters for customs clearance. Once cleared, the contractor will take receivership of all equipment and deliver it to a storage facility with appropriate security, space, and environmental conditions for computers.
The contractor will arrange for a publicity event, perhaps at the storage facility. The event should include appropriate USAID and GOU education officials, perhaps some personnel from likely beneficiary schools, and the press. USAID and the US Embassy can be of some assistance with regard to this event, but the contractor must be prepared to take on most of the responsibility for it.
Careful, detailed inventory of the equipment, including memory capacity and software applications already installed in CPUs, and working condition of all equipment, will be recorded and supplied to the Uzbekistan Country Office and to USAID/CAR?s Contracts Office. The contractor will assure that when plugged in, all hardware is switched to 240V, and will label and test all equipment, and record in the inventory its working condition. Any damage will be noted in the inventory. Any damaged equipment will be repaired by the contractor if possible. Irreparable equipment must be noted to USAID. All necessary plug re-fitting will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
Each USG-donated CPU will arrive with an operating system installed. Other software already on the CPU is likely to vary greatly. We will not know until this testing phase which CPUs require which software, based on the distribution plan packages and the assessment of needs. Anti-virus software should be one prerequisite to any CPU before distribution. The contractor will recommend to USAID which software packages (and how many) to procure, and obtain quotes. Upon USAID approval, the contractor will procure that software and install it on the appropriate CPU, updating the inventory as software is installed. All newly procured CPUs will require operating systems, and other software packages recommended by the contractor.
The contractor will submit a list of software to be procured, and its cost, for USAID approval. This list will be based upon
the assessment of needs outlined in the previous paragraph (including the USG-donated CPUs and newly procured CPUs),
software already available (installed or uninstalled) through this donation, and 
the price quote obtained earlier.
Once procured, the contractor will load the software as per the distribution plan.
Once all software is installed and recorded on the inventory, the inventory is to be considered in its initial phase, and shall be submitted to USAID.
Based on the initial inventory, USAID and the contractor will together decide upon the final distribution plan for the equipment. At least one faster computer should be assigned to each school as possible.
Distribution, Monitoring, and Maintenance
The contractor will be responsible for distributing and installing all equipment, and seeing to appropriate electrical and security upgrades as necessary, according to the USAID-approved distribution plan. Each school must sign a Beneficiary Agreement before installation will begin. Internet connections will be established as part of the installation where appropriate, along with any appropriate networking. The contractor will also provide at least one day?s training to appropriate school personnel as to the proper usage and basic maintenance of the equipment, according to the approved training plan.
Internet access to appropriate beneficiary schools will be provided as part of this award for a period of 6 months from installation date.
Distribution, installation, and training should be complete within two months of the equipment?s arrival.
After distribution is made, the contractor is responsible for maintenance of all computer equipment for a period of six months, on an on-call basis. USAID expects the contractor to respond to repair calls within 24 hours of receiving word of malfunction. Where possible, appropriate school personnel should be on hand to observe the repair, so that they may learn to carry it out in the future, should the problem arise again. This fact will be made clear in the Beneficiary Agreements. Any equipment destroyed in this period at the beneficiary location will be reported in monitoring visit reports to USAID.
Over this final six-month period, the contractor will carry out the agreed to monitoring plan, and report to USAID monthly. USAID will conduct a review near the end of this 6-month period to assess the need to exercise the extension option.
Selection Criteria and Requirements
The implementing partner shall have a proven ability to handle high-profile projects, long-term presence, relevant experience, and commitment to the region, good track record, demonstrated organizational and administrative capacity, and necessary technical skills and expertise to achieve the goals of the program. Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of volunteer computer service organizations for appropriate components of the activity.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
Technical, cost and other factors will be evaluated relative to each other, as described herein. Cost factors will be weighted heavily.
-The technical proposal will be scored by a technical evaluation committee using the criteria shown in this Section.
-The cost proposal will be scored by the method described in this Section.
-The criteria below are presented by major category, with relative order of importance, so that offerors will know which areas require emphasis in the preparation of proposals. The criteria below reflect the requirements of this particular solicitation.
Offerors should note that these criteria: (1) serve as the standard against which all proposals will be evaluated, and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which offerors should address in their proposals.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: BEST VALUE
A review panel established under the direction of the Contracting Officer, USAID/CAR, will evaluate proposals.  The review panel and the Contracting Officer will use ?Best Value? criteria to determine the proposal most advantageous to the U.S. Government. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equal to cost or price. Technical evaluation factors, and the subfactors thereof, are listed below in their relative order of importance. Contract award shall be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose combined technical and cost factor offer the best value to the U.S. Government.
A. COST EVALUATION
The contractor should have a structure that will allow it to provide the greatest value (highest results) at the lowest cost; minimizing and/or eliminating overall administrative costs, overhead, subcontract pass-through costs, profit, international staff benefits, home office communications and support, and other non-value added costs. Each offeror's cost proposal (base period and option periods) shall be evaluated based on the following criteria in comparison with the cost proposal of other offerors:
1) Effectiveness of proposed cost control structure
Budget transparency to effectively track expenditures;
Consistency of proposed LOE, travel costs and ODCs;
Soundness of purchase and acquisition methods;
Subcontracting methods are clearly defined.
2) Cost efficiency of proposed Other Direct Costs
Offers market competitive pricing estimates of tangible items to be used for contract performance;
Competitiveness pricing and purchase methods of in-country air travel and surface transportation.
3) Reasonableness of overall proposed price
Price has not been assigned a numerical weight. Offerors are reminded that the U.S. Government is not obligated to award a negotiated contract on the basis of the lowest proposed cost (see FAR 15.101-1) or to the offeror with the highest technical evaluation score. For this procurement technical proposal is equal to cost or price relative to deciding who best might perform the work, price and other factors considered. Therefore, after the final evaluation of the proposals, the Contracting Officer will make the award to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, considering both technical and cost factors.  It should be noted that estimate cost is an important factor and its importance as an evaluation factor will increase as the degree of equality of technical competence between proposals increases.

<DESC>QF-4 FULL SCALE AERIAL TARGET (FSAT) PRODUCTION OPTIONS MARKET RESEACH SYNOPSIS - POC Leanne Green, Contract Specialist, 850-882-9307, Ext 5057; Marcia Smith, Contracting Officer, 850-882-9391, Ext 5252; 1LT Gabe Hiley, Program Manager, 850-882-9307, Ext 5177.  The purpose of this synopsis is for market research to find qualified sources that have the capabilities to produce FSATs.   The production of the FSATs requires a substantial initial investment as well as an extended period of preparation and sustainment.  The Aerial Targets Integrated Product Team (IPT), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, plans to contract for follow-on production of the QF-4 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT), an acquisition that is currently projected to extend into the 2009 timeframe.  The QF-4 program entails modification of government-provided F-4E and RF-4C aircraft with a contractor-furnished equipment/installation package to provide a remotely controlled, supersonic, afterburning FSAT capable of all-attitude, high G maneuvering flight, compatible with the Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) at Tyndall and Eglin AFBs FL and the Drone Formation Control System (DFCS) at the White Sands Missile Range NM.  Major contractor-furnished items are:  (1) Command Telemetry System (CTS), (2) Primary and Back-up Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCSs), (3) Flight Termination System (FTS), and (4) Vector Scorer System [Currently, the Vector Doppler Scoring System (VDOPS) produced by Cartwright Electronics, Inc.].  Establishment/maintenance of a body of engineering expertise/sustaining engineering capability will be an integral contract requirement in order to facilitate implementation of candidate system changes/enhancements as requested by the operational community.  Integration of new/additional elements such as newly developed target control system [currently the Multi-Service Target Control System (MSTCS) being developed by the 46th Test Wing, Eglin AFB FL] and service-unique payloads interfaces will be required.  Sustaining engineering support requirement is projected to extend to 2011. Prior contracts have been issued for EMD and production lots 1-9.  This procurement is a continuation of the production of FSATs and is expected to include annual lot buys for production lots ten (10) through thirteen (13).   Each lot option will include the following provisions:  (1) Procurement of a variable quantity ranging from 12 to 24 FSATs with a best estimated quantity of 16 targets per lot, (2) Maintenance/repair of government-furnished F-4 aircraft for the period from receipt for modification at the contractor's facility through FSAT delivery to Tyndall AFB FL, (3) Sustaining engineering for support of the currently deployed FSAT systems (to include configuration management, development of design changes, integration, and documentation (engineering and technical order data) of newly defined requirements), (4)  Drone-unique component warranty (option -- two (2)-year or life-time / five (5)-year period of performance), (5)  Repair of non-warranted (out-of-warranty) FSAT system equipment, (6)  Sustained logistics/drone-unique technical order/manual (issued as supplemental manuals to basic F-4 manual series) support, (7) On-site technical representative at Tyndall AFB FL, and (8)  Spares provisioning.  Environmental stress screening (ESS) from the lowest assembly through the system-level will be required on all drone-unique system components.  All drone-unique components procured from other than currently qualified component vendor(s) will be subject to a formal qualification program requirement.  All FTS explosive components will be subject to lot acceptance testing.  The QF-4 FSAT system is defined by the following documentation to be placed in a technical library accessible to potential bidders in the January 03 timeframe.  Government-developed/ maintained System Specification, (2) Contractor-developed and maintained set of Type-B (B1,B2, and B5) Specifications, (3) Contractor-developed and maintained set of Type-C (C1, C1b, C2, C2b, C4, and C5) Specifications, (4) Level-III Re-procurement Data Package, and (5) Set of drone-unique supplemental manuals to the basic F-4 technical order series.  Specifications are on digital media, format compatible with Microsoft Windows - Word/Excel/Power Point.  The Level III data package consists primarily of digital media - text in Microsoft Windows - Word/Excel/Power Point format, mechanical drawings in .dwg file extension, Auto Cad format, and electrical/electronic/artwork in Gerber Out format.  Technical order consists of Word-Perfect text files with Auto Cad and Gerber Out format illustration sub-files.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable documents with this solicitation.  Current plans are to include a copy of all reference documents except the F-4 basic technical order series in a technical library that will be located on the Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS) site - a Lotus Notes-based digital data base site accessible via the Internet.  All related program documentation, except for the basic F-4 technical order/manual series, can be examined at that location (when established, as authorized/cleared by the Program Office). However, the Program Office will have to coordinate use of the F-4 technical order library, maintained by the 475WEG at Tyndall AFB FL, on an as required/requested basis.  The government plans to make updated information concerning this acquisition available to qualified offerors via FedBizOps.  A draft request for proposal (DRFP) is planned for release in January 2003.  Formal RFP release is planned for May 2003 with proposal submittal required in September 2003.  Contract award is planned for February 2004 with a 24-month core contract performance period for each option buy (first delivery 12 months after award/option exercise, last delivery 24 months after award/option exercise date).  Only qualified U.S. prime contractors who have registered with and are certified by the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Service Center, Battle Creek MI 49016-3412 (1-800-352-3572) are eligible to receive solicitations.  Certification is accomplished using DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Two-Position Optical Actuator Device
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE A TWO-POSITION OPTICAL ACTUATOR DEVICE.


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to produce a two-position optical actuator device.

LLNL is a world leader in laser system design, and has developed a patented device for moving laser optics and optical hardware s in and out of a laser beam path in a quick, precise, gentle, and automated manner.  This device consists of a motorized, cam-based mechanism with limit sensing switches at each of its two final positions, and the device typically moves laser optics through a 90 degree arc between the two final resting positions.  The special cam-based design and non-linear motor permit rapid yet gentle acceleration and deceleration of the optics between the two positions.  The motor and limit sensing switches permit remote operation and sensing of the device's status.  The mechanical design of the device is very scalable and potentially capable of handling very heavy optics, such as those used on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL.  The device as used on the NIF currently accommodates the use of the following types of laser optic devices:
1.	Lenses
2.	Mirrors
3.	Polarizers
4.	Waveplates
5.	Attenuators
6.	Beamstops

Other potential applications include:
1.	Any transportable energy output sources, sensors, detectors, or other laser diagnostic instruments including laser/light sources or laser detection devices
2.	Moveable beamstops for use as laser safety shutters.
  
LLNL currently produces and uses this device extensively on NIF.  The current design has undergone thorough testing for functionality and reliability.   Current devices have been operated reliably for over 1,000,000 operations.  LLNL not only has an interest in licensing this technology, but will also consider the option of purchasing these devices from the licensee once they are commercially available.  

This device also has potential application outside the field of laser optics.   Any application that needs to move fragile material in a quick, precise, gentle, and automated manner between two positions separated by a 90 degree arc could potentially benefit from this technology.

LLNL has three patents pertaining to this device.   The patents are as follows:
?	6,144,506  (Bi-Stable Optical Actuator).
?	6,381,080 (Bi-Stable Optical Element Actuator Device).
?	6,384,990 (Two Position Optical Element Actuator Device).

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's two-position optical actuator device should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	The company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-014-301

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's two-position optical actuator device.
