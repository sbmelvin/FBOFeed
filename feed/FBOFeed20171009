Synopsis: 
COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for brand name only commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C19G18Q0040 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.
Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA

In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase Alaris brand Infusion Pumps to deliver patient care at 106 of its VA Medical Centers around the country. The VA is looking to establish a three year contract based on demonstrated ability of the supplier to decrease costs. 
A single-award Firm-Fixed Price contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein. Quotes shall contain the Offeror s best terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand name equipment. The government reserves the right to award without discussions.
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112 and the associated size standard is 1000 employees.  
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Alaris brand Infusion Pumps and related equipment and accessories as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  
The ordering period is 3 years (36 months).  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria as attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror that provides the lowest price technically acceptable quote and whose quote conforms to the solicitation.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Technical 
Price

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer, if not available in SAM
