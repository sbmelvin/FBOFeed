AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utility Privatization Grissom AFRC, Indiana Natural Gas Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is Jul 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Grissom ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way.  The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate.  The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are:  None.
Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSC) supplies natural gas to Grissom Air Reserve Base under an interruptible gas service contract. This type of contract allows the local utility to curtail gas service to customers on the interruptible agreement under extreme weather conditions when their priority customers, e.g., hospitals and residential customers, require the supply of additional gas. 
A single eight-inch (8”) pipeline enters the base at a fenced compound and runs alongside Harry Forman Drive.  Gas service is supplied to the base at 55 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) through a regulating station located on the service main ahead of the metering station and the installation distribution network.  The gas main passes through one metering and valve station, and gas is distributed to each facility at a reduced but variable pressure.  NIPSC owns and maintains the odorizing equipment.  There is a limited amount of tracer wire on the remaining system.  However the exact location and amount is unknown.  
The natural gas is distributed throughout the main base through approximately four miles of underground pipeline.  These lines are owned entirely by Grissom ARB.  The average depth of burial is 36”.  The gas main is constructed of either polyethylene pipe (PE), or in some locations, high-density polyethylene (HDPE).  There are 32 buildings within the cantonment area supplied natural gas directly.  The majority are not separately metered.  Grissom ARB deactivated their steam plant August 2000.  All facilities within the cantonment area are on alternative heating systems.
The NIPSC central metering point located was relocated from just inside the fence to a point by the truck scales.  There are ten government owned secondary metering points on base.  
The most significant impact to the natural gas system was the deactivation of the central steam heat plant and the construction of new support facilities inside the cantonment area.  A study of the heat plant identified potential energy savings in gas demand of 20-30% by converting individual buildings to alternative independent heating systems.  Additionally, the new facilities, while adding over 285,000-sq. ft. of heating space, replace over 400,000-sq. ft. of older less energy efficient structures.  The combined savings from both programs are estimated at 33.5% gas demand.
Grissom’s natural gas piping system is relatively new.  The entire gas main piping network was replaced under several different contracts between 1989 and 1997.  The mains include both PE and HDPE pipe according to construction drawings and discussions with NIPSC and shop personnel.  The specific locations and ranges of each type of distribution piping are not identifiable with assured accuracy. 
NIPSC provides maintenance on an as needed and emergency-repair arrangement with the base.  Over the last four years, only minor maintenance repairs were required.  NIPSC identified and satisfactorily corrected each problem.  NIPSC also maintains the repair records and documentation.

Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to potential sources to privatize the eletrical distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The Niagara Falls ARS electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way. The system may include, but is not limited to, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, ductbanks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are:
•	Concrete encasement and ducts carrying communication lines or empty ducts in underground circuit on property of the 107th ARW
•	Parking Lot & Security Lights that are fed directly from Buildings
•	emergency generators
•	Building 850 (supplies electric to Mast Lights)
•	Airfield lighting, apron lights, airfield lighting vaults, and all associated equipment.  This includes Building 891 and the FAA transformers in Building 724.
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate electrical distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. The separate systems are connected at a switch located on the property line between the 107th ARW and the 914th AW. The switch is gang locked open to prevent the circuit from closing and causing injuries and damage to the electrical systems. 
	Niagara Mohawk supplies electric power at two different points on the installation for the general distribution systems.  Electricity is supplied to the 914th AW through the main switch adjacent to the base entrance on Lockport Road and to the 107th ARW through a switch adjacent to the Guardian Street entrance to the base, along Tuscarora Road. Base ownership of the electric facilities starts with the main switches. Electricity is delivered to both feeds at 13.2 kV.
	The primary electrical distribution system for the 914th AW consists of an overhead, three-phase, four-wire system rated at 13.2 kV. This system was installed in the 1990’s and completely replaced the old system with new poles, wires, transformers and switches. There are overhead primary circuit, overhead secondary circuit and underground secondary circuit. 
	The electrical distribution system on the 107th ARW is also new (constructed in the 1990’s). The primary electrical distribution system for the 107th ARW consists of underground primary, three phase circuits operating at 13.2kV, underground secondary circuit and primary circuit mounted overhead on new poles. Underground lines are protected by a duct-bank consisting of four conduits encased in concrete. One conduit carries power, one conduit carries fiber optic communication line, and two conduits are empty for future use.  Only the conduit carrying the electrical wires will be transferred to the new owner.
	Both systems are master metered with secondary meters located at various locations within the base for monitoring specific building use.
A third electrical supply point exists to supply electricity to the geographically separated area at the east end of the main runway.  Building 724 is the decommissioned pump station for a decommissioned water reservoir.  Building 724 also houses electrical circuits for the FAA runway lighting system.  Building 724  and the reservoir will be demolished after funding is approved.  Building 729 contains the water meter and backflow-preventer for the main water supply system from the City of Niagara Falls.   

Inventory for the system will be included in the RFP.

The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

<p>TITLE: Automated COMINT Collection and Processing</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 10-06-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required to support automated COMmunications INTelligence (COMINT) collection and processing. Solutions to engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. The overall technical objective of the BAA is to develop research into unique and innovative techniques and algorithms that support the collection, processing and exploitation of electronic communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Developing techniques for the automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation of existing and emerging signals of interest; (2) Advancing digital signal processing hardware and software methodologies in support systems; and (3) Integration of these capabilities into information operation systems. Detailed focus areas and definitions of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection of target signals, dense signal environments, low power signals, low Signal to Interferer Noise Ratio (SINR), and power control. Due to the proliferation of wireless devices worldwide, there are significant amounts of signals of interest across the spectrum. The ability for automated processing in dense signal environments, low power signals low SINR, and power control etc., is highly desired. (2) Any technologies that will enable SIGINT platforms with an improved ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and more importantly geolocate signals of interest would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation: Technology that can further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is a critical focus area of research covered by this BAA. Particular attention will be paid to geolocation technologies. Technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters that are below the level of interference. (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD): Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired. We will continue to pursue these methods, but also encourage new and innovative techniques, including but not limited to spatial techniques, blind adaptive techniques and Kalman filtering. Research into specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms is also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamforming and digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antennas are a part of this announcement. This includes developing different types of beamforming techniques such as A/D beamforming, array processing and blind adaptive techniques, while taking into consideration environmental constraints and temporal and spatial processing. Also of interest are techniques that utilize the latest technology and emerging processor architectures as well as applying systems engineering approaches to platform integration, existing asset sharing, signal processing paths hardware constraints and reducing size, weight and power. (6) Time difference of arrival (TDOA), Frequency difference of arrival (FDOA), channel equalization, angle of arrival (AOA) and systems equalization techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable are desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: Critical to this BAA is developing signal reconstruction and automatic signal identification (along with the technology thrusts mentioned above) for emerging military and commercial radio communications including third, fourth and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (8) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding in UAV-type platforms. Attention to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest. (9) Information Operations (IO) consists of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations (EW Ops), network warfare operations (NW Ops) and influence operations (IFO). The innovative techniques and capabilities described in this BAA play a vital role in capturing key indicators of measure of performance (MOP) and measure of effectiveness (MOE) for information operations, the processed information furnished from the intelligence gathering technologies provide the continuous decision-quality information necessary to successfully employ air, space, and information operations. Integration of these techniques into information operations systems is also of high interest.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office (TTO) seeks to further develop Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) technology under Phase II of the Vulcan program. CVC technology is recognized as having the potential to significantly impact multiple defense and commercial Applications. DARPA is interested in ultimately conducting a full scale demonstration of the technology. DARPA seeks proposals that will culminate in a demonstration of a Vulcan Engine (CVC module + power turbine engine) that addresses near-term DoD transition needs with the potential to support future DoD and commercial applications.
<p>Program Description: DARPA is interested in an end-to-end demonstration of a production turbine engine with an integrated CVC Module. DARPA encourages teams to come up with an innovative program plan to quickly mature technology for rapid transition to the U.S. Navy. DARPA expects proposing teams will include expertise in CVC technology and in turbine engine-based ship power generation systems. Technology developers with expertise in more specific component areas are encouraged to team with a proposer(s) capable of delivering the complete Vulcan Engine (CVC module + turbine engine).</p>
<p>The Vulcan Engine demonstration program will be conducted in two phases:</p>
<p>Phase II: CVC Module Development and Demonstration</p>
<p>Phase III: Vulcan Engine Performance Testing (CVC Module + turbine engine)</p>
<p>During Phase II the CVC module will be developed, fabricated, tested and fully characterized through analytical models as well as component and subsystem testing prior to the final integration into the turbine engine. In this phase, the proposers will complete a Systems Requirement Review for the Vulcan Engine; perform CVC module component risk reduction and integration testing; complete CVC Module rig testing with compressor and turbine interfaces where a CVC Module Simulator is envisioned as a test article to duplicate the unsteady pressure, thermal, and acoustic boundary conditions of the inlet and exhaust of the CVC combustion module and to improve and reduce uncertainty in predictions of Vulcan Engine performance, capability and durability; and perform a Preliminary Design Review of the Vulcan Engine. It is expected that the Vulcan Engine design system will be continuously updated with higher fidelity models, component test data, and data from the CVC Module Simulator rig tests to improve and reduce uncertainty in predictions of Vulcan Engine performance, capability and durability.</p>
<p>Phase III will focus on the development, design and testing of a complete Vulcan Engine. The desire at the end of Phase III, at a minimum, is to demonstrate a complete Vulcan engine with the fully integrated CVC module and validate durability, operability, capability and performance at various turbine engine power settings. DARPA would like to challenge the proposers to think about ways to rapidly increase the technology readiness of their CVC technology and the Vulcan Engine to minimize the time to field the technology.&nbsp; Note-any award(s) made as a result of this BAA will be for Phase&nbsp; II of the Vulcan program only. Phase III program objectives are provided to assist proposers in developing their Phase II proposals.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the complete BAA, refer to the attachment entitled, "DARPA-BAA-10-11." Also note that the proposal due date for the initial round is 12:00 noon (ET), March 12, 2010 and the final proposal due date is 12:00 noon (ET), June 11, 2010.</p>

The Santa Fe National Forest requires A&E services for Golondrino/Southwest Jemez Cadastral Survey Project.  This is a Request for Qualifications solicitation. This solicitation is being conducted under FAR 36.6 and 19.13 as a Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HubZone) Program.  The NAICS code for this action is 541370 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million. Award will only be made to an A&E firm that meets the small business size standard and is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as required by FAR 4.11. The CCR is accessible at the following website: https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx

This Request for Qualifications requires the submittal of a Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications (SF 330) Part I and II for consideration in the evaluation and selection process. 

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

The Santa Fe National Forest plans to secure a contract(s) for professional surveying services in support of the Golondrino Wildlife Management Prescribed Fire Project and the Southwest Jemez Mountains Landscape Restoration Project.  These projects are designed for restoration and hazardous fuels reduction needs in order to minimize human health and safety risks.  The Government reserves the right to award one or multiple contracts for this solicitation.

The work will involve professional surveying which includes marking property boundary lines between Santa Fe National Forest Land and Private Land within the Santa Fe National Forest Proclamation Boundary. The identification of the boundary lines between private and Forest Service Lands is crucial for the protection of Private Lands and ensures proper management of National Forest Lands.

Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation, and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys which will require the results of the surveys to be recorded in the public record. The project includes geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the State of New Mexico will be considered.

The contract will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area.

Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, the qualification and performance data submitted, firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation. Selection of firms for negotiation shall be made through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualification necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required.

EPA anticipates awarding a single 5-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) fixed-price task order contract.  Specific requirements will be identified in written task orders issued by the Contracting Officer.  In addition to price, the Government?s evaluation of proposals will include assessment of each offeror?s past performance record on similar projects, corporate qualifications, and personnel qualifications.  All non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  
The price evaluation shall be based on prices submitted for the first projected task order.  The specifications and drawings for the first projected task order shall be a part of the solicitation package.  It is estimated that any resulting contract will specify a minimum order amount of $35,000 and a maximum order amount of $1,000,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238990, Other Specialty Trade Contractors.  EPA intends to satisfy this procurement through Full and Open Competition.  The solicitation will be released through the Federal Business Opportunities website on or about January 27, 2010.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Project
Firm, Fixed-Price (FFP) Design/Build contract - GSA has need for full design and installation of an engineered copper scrim product with all its necessary components, support, anchors, labor and materials for the new 8 story, 239,600 gross square foot United States Federal Courthouse in El Paso, Texas. The project envisions a fully installed and functioning system that is designed to accommodate the existing building's structural and architectural components. The original concept design featured this energy conservation, copper exterior window shading scrim, to act as a shading device against the El Paso sun.

The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about January 26, 2010.  The contract will be issued as a Design-Build with one base and three options in which the base will be awarded for the west side of the building and the three options being for the south, east and north sides.

The selected contractor will accomplish all work in accordance with the Scope of Work (SOW) and conceptual design drawings provided by GSA. The designer may come up with something different than the concept design as long as it is similar. Installation cannot begin until the construction contractor for the courthouse has vacated the site.

This procurement will be competed full and open. Proposals will be evaluated for technical capability and price. Technical qualifications are significantly more important than price.

The Government will provide bridging documents, for background information purposes only, on the original concept project design documents (plans and specifications) to prospective offerors as part of the Request for Proposal (RFP). An on site pre-proposal conference will be held to allow all prospective offerors an opportunity to visit the project site and ask questions about the project SOW.

Prior to receipt of proposals all offerors must be registered in CCR (Central Contractor Registration) at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx and have completed their Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/.

If the awarded contractor is a large business, they will be required to complete a subcontracting plan.  Below are the GSA subcontracting goals for prime contractors.

SUBCONTRACTING GOALS (2009 goals are still in affect for 2010)

Small Business			37%

<a href="mailto:shamekia.m.underwood@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>In general, the work consists of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform Operation and Maintenance Services for DOD Army Medical Facilities nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Anticipated work contains full-service, continuous-coverage operation and maintenance (O&M) of medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.  In addition, task orders may be awarded for construction requirements incidental to O&M (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  There are a wide variety of buildings and finishes (and a variety of building ages and conditions) that will be covered on any given O&M Task Order.  Buildings vary from World War II lapped siding to new pre-engineered metal buildings to towering steel-frame pre-cast concrete skinned multi-story buildings.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to emergency generators; electrical switchgear; electrical distribution; lighting; plumbing systems; roof and storm drain systems; heating ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC] heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; operating room and isolation room pressurization systems; digital HVAC controls; nurse call; patient monitoring systems; intrusion detection systems; infant abduction systems; fire detection/alarm systems; fire sprinkler systems; carbon dioxide, wet and dry chemical fire suppression systems; elevators; pneumatic tube and box conveyor transport systems; medical gas systems to include medical air compressors, medical vacuum pumps, bulk oxygen tank farms, and medical gas and vacuum distribution and alarm panels; laboratory fume hoods; interior finishes; signage systems; structural building components such as roofs and building exterior faade; and passive fire protection systems (including fire and smoke partition integrity maintenance).  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding O&M tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility  many with a critically ill inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but Contractors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from badging to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.<BR>The Government contemplates awards of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  Firm Fixed-Price Task Orders will be issued against the contracts. The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is $250,000,000.00. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally. Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process. The requirement is handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Mobile, AL. Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 23 February 2010.  Contracting Officer for this project is Ms. Donna Parker.  <BR>Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email to jacalyn.m.jenkins@usace.army.mil and cynthia.y.dunham@usace.army.mil or facsimile: 251-690-2675.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Container Program is seeking industry feedback from interested parties concerning the supply of certain containers to military and federal activities. This is not a solicitation and the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information.
The subject containers are:
•	20 Foot New ISO Containers 
o	NSN 8150-01-463-8553
o	Estimated Yearly Quantity 3500 each
•	20 Foot Refurbished Containers

o	Estimated Yearly Quantity 130 each
•	40 Foot Refurbished Containers
o	NSN 8150-01-463-3182
o	Estimated Yearly Quantity 80 each
DSCP intends to solicit offers from the commercial industry for the above listed containers.  This request is being issued in order to support the needs of the military services and other federal agencies on a worldwide basis. DSCP intends to solicit offers from the commercial industry and ultimately issue contract(s) to responsible sources that offer a fair and reasonable price.  This is being done in order to provide our customers with quality containers that will satisfy their requirements.  Any resulting solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.
Any contract(s) issued as a result of the solicitation will be issued as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQ) which will offer a nominal guaranteed minimum. It is proposed to issue the contract(s) for a total of four years that includes a single base year and three (3), one-year option periods. The contract(s) will be issued on an all or none basis.
It is DSCP’s intention to issue multiple long-term IDIQ contracts and to compete each individual delivery requirement between those vendors that receive a contract. The offerors base year price will be a “ceiling” price.  The base year “ceiling” price will be subject to an annual economic price adjustment (EPA) up to 10% per year.  This EPA adjustment will be considered during the “option” period of the contract ONLY.  The EPA adjustment will not be considered during the competition of each individual delivery requirement therefore base year “ceiling” price cannot be exceeded during the competitive process.  The competitive procedures that will be used for the individual delivery requirements will issued by way of an informal request for quote (RFQ).  This RFQ will describe the quantity, delivery location and additional evaluation criteria such as past performance and/or urgent delivery requirements.  Once all offers are received an evaluation will be made.  Interested parties are encouraged to download and complete the questionnaire at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/containers/RFIIntro.asp .  Email responses to containers@dla.mil no later than January 27, 2010, 5:00 PM EST.  Any questions regarding this RFI must also be emailed to the containers@dla.mil email address.

Indicated Ash content is based on average year environmental conditions and straight grade extraction levels. The actual ash content may vary from year to year based on the mineral content of the endosperm. Targeted functionality will remain the same from crop year to crop year.

Yoshon Certificate Requirement: Offerors shall certify that their manufacturing plant is capable of meeting applicable dietary (kosher) laws” and provide a Yoshon Certificate for bulk flour which has been certified as “Yoshon” by a rabbinic certifying agency which meets the guidelines of the “613 Council of Rabbis”.

Truck Certification Requirement: All bulk flour which has been certified as “yoshon” by a rabbinic certifying agency which meets the guidelines of the “613 Council of Rabbis,” must be transported under the following conditions:  The bulk transporting containers as well as the mills outbound flour conveyance system must be kosherized in the presence of a supervising Rabbi who is acceptable to the “613 Council of Rabbis.” Once the containers are filled with the flour, they must be sealed with the imprimatur of the supervising rabbi and remain intact until it reaches the respective baker.

Definition of Yoshon – winter crop

“In order to determine if a grain is yoshon or chodosh, it is necessary to know when the plants have taken root. If it took root before the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan, it is from the old crop and it is yoshon. If it took root on or after the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan, it is from the new crop and it is chodosh.  Other crops are planted in the fall, lie dormant during the winter, finish growing in the spring and summer, and are harvested in the summer. These are known as winter crops. Since they are planted in the fall, they take root well before the 16th of Nissan and all winter crop is always yoshon by the time it is harvested.  In the United States, spring crops are usually planted so late that the development of the plant roots does not take place until after the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan. Therefore, spring crops are almost always chodosh at the time of the summer harvest and are not permissible for consumption until after the following Passover (15th of the month of Nissan).  Therefore, the only way to provide for strict adherence to the Biblical precept of yoshon, it is necessary to either use winter wheat or store spring wheat until after the following Passover.” – Joel S. Beritz, Vice President, Gruss Life Monument Funds

Description
THIS RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 15.201(E), RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT.  RESPONDENTS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI.  AT THIS TIME, PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IS NOT BEING REQUESTED, AND RESPONDENTS SHALL REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ALL SUBMISSIONS BECOME GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND WILL NOT BE RETURNED.  NOT RESPONDING TO THIS RFI DOES NOT PRECLUDE PARTICIPATION IN A FUTURE RFP, IF ONE IS ISSUED.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT AT THIS TIME SEEKING PROPOSALS AND WILL NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS. RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULT OF THE REVIEW.
 

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential companies/contractors that design and administer customer satisfaction surveys and create reports using a system that will provide American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) methodology or similar methods.  The Office of Customer Accounts & Research (CAR), a component of FAS, is charged with the responsibility to capture and manage FAS customer satisfaction intelligence.  

FAS’ Office of Customer Accounts and Research (CAR) desires to conduct satisfaction surveys of Federal agency customers for each FAS’ Business Line and satisfaction surveys of Business Lines for each FAS integrator office and have the top line results of those surveys available to FAS management.  
The overarching goal of FAS’s Survey Program is to help achieve FAS’ strategic and tactical goals by providing business units and support offices with information about their customers and vendors that will enable them to take steps to improve customer satisfaction and retention; improve vendor satisfaction; and increase the number of customers that come to GSA to fill their requirements for services and products.
The current customer satisfaction survey process has its genesis from the recommendations contained in the National Performance Review (NPR).  This review suggested Federal agencies take a customer-centric approach by regularly asking their customers, in essence, how they view the government services they receive, what problems they encounter, and how they’d like services improved.  The recommendations became a mandate with the issuance of Executive Order 12862 of September 1993, which formally established the requirement that Federal agencies regularly survey their customers.
GSA and FAS have made it a priority to provide business units with information about their customers that will enable them to take steps to improve customer satisfaction and retention; improve vendor satisfaction; and enable them to increase the number of customers that come to GSA to fill their requirements for services and products through internal and external market research, analysis, and surveys.  Currently, most research is being conducted independently within each portfolio and business line with little collaboration.  This has led to escalating overlap in contracting and research costs as well as gathering of information and data.  In addition to the rising costs and overlapping data, the Survey BPA currently hosted by CAR has expired with a continuing need to administer internal and external customer satisfaction surveys for incentivized strategic scorecard goals.
Most surveys conducted by FAS since 2001 have used the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) methodology to obtain satisfaction scores.  Due to wide acceptance of this type of measurement system as means of comparing performance across organizations, agencies and industries, ACSI, or a similar methodology will likely continue to be used in the future. Information about ACSI can be found at the following website: http://www.theacsi.org/

DESIRED INFORMATION:  Documentation may be submitted at any time after issuance of the RFI up to the expiration date of the RFI.  All submissions shall be submitted by email.  No additional data will be provided in support of this RFI. All information in responses should be unclassified. Email submissions/inquiries should be directed to Zoe-Ann Freitag, Contracting Officer, zoe-ann.freitag@gsa.gov and Jannine Wilkinson, Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) jannine.wilkinson@gsa.gov. Contractor information must be received by January 19, 2010.

<a href="mailto:maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov">Mary Helen  Ruiz</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, located inPasadena, California, operating under a prime contract with NASA seeks potentialcontractors to provide information on the design, verification and validation of fieldprogrammable gate arrays in support of the Jupiter Europa Orbiter Mission (EJSM).BACKGROUND: The EJSM is a joint NASA/ESA mission that consists of two (2) flight elementsexploring the Jovian system: the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), and the ESA-ledJupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). JEO and JGO will execute a choreographed exploration ofthe Jupiter System before settling into orbit around Europa and Ganymede, respectively.The baseline JEO and JGO mission concept carries 11 and 10 complementary instruments,respectively, to monitor dynamic phenomena (such as Ios volcanoes and Jupitersatmosphere), map the Jovian magnetosphere and its interactions with the Galileansatellites, and characterize water oceans beneath the ice shells of Europa and Ganymede.JEO is designed to follow-up on the major discoveries of the Galileo and Voyager missionsat Europa, especially its ocean. The Jovian magnetic field is approximately twenty (20)times larger than that of Earths. The radiation environment for this baseline missionconcept is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum.This level is seven (7) times greater than any previous NASA mission. JEO plans to belaunched in February 2020 on an Atlas V 551 following a Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assists(VEEGA) trajectory, and arrives at Jupiter in December 2025. Jupiter Orbit Insertion(JOI) begins a 30 month Jovian system tour followed by a 9 month science mapping phaseafter Europa Orbit Insertion (EOI) in July 2028. The orbiter will ultimately impact thesurface of Europa after succumbing to radiation damage or running out of orbitmaintenance fuel. The JEO flight system is comparable in size and complexity to otherspacecraft for similar missions such as Cassini or MRO. The concept would feature fullredundancy for engineering functions, 3-axis stabilized pointing, a radio-isotope powersource (RPS) with batteries for peak power management, bi-propellant chemical propulsion,a large gimbaled high gain antenna (HGA), and X-band and Ka-band transponders fortracking, telemetry and precision Doppler measurements. The baseline ten (10) yearmission requires that all electronic components be hardened to a minimum of 100-300 kRad.The radiation challenges and long-duration demand state-of-the-art spacecraft and designcapabilities.PURPOSE: JPL seeks to solicit the best practices in field programmable gate array (FPGA)design, verification and validation from potential contractors.  FPGA technologyrepresents the state of the art in highly complex digital electronics for a wide varietyof space applications.	The specific mission assurance and risk mitigation requirementsof the JEO mission will be of such a level as to require that any FPGAs used on themission to have been designed and verified with the most robust, thorough, and effectiveprocess possible to withstand the harsh radiation environment encountered during themission lifetime.  Contractors shall provide information on processes, documentation,requirements, team structures and organizations, hardware and software tools, testbenches, configuration management, and any other relevant information as to why theirproposed FPGA coding and verification methodology should be considered as a best practicefor the baseline EJSM mission concept.	Contractors are urged to provide case studiesand/or practical examples.  Discussion of radiation mitigation and management of FPGAs isalso stressed.REQUIREMENT: All the submittals will be vetted and integrated for review within the JPLFPGA community. The results of this review will form the basis for the FPGA workshopplanned for April later this year; and for the JEO recommendation guidelines for use ofFPGAs to be discussed at the Summer 2010 EJSM Instrument Workshop.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span><br /><br />The Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) has been developed by the Office of the Director (OD), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the OD, to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat and diagnose cancer. The goal of the CBC is to develop a network of academic and private drug discovery efforts that along with DCTD's current early development resources will establish a complete drug discovery and development platform for oncology therapeutics. This network of multidisciplinary scientific expertise, along with varied technical and infrastructure resources within the network, will work together to support execution of drug discovery and development projects from discovery to first in human studies in a team centric approach. One critical infrastructure resource that this platform will require is chemical repository services to function as the network's central resource to procure, receive, analyze, store, track and distribute chemical compounds expected to be generated throughout project execution. Our current assessment of the progress of this program anticipates the generation and management of arrayed libraries built from up to 250,000 diverse compounds. The compounds will be acquired from commercial and other sources. We will also require management (acquisition, analysis, distribution and storage) of 2,500-5,000 CBC member generated dry samples in the first year and 5,000-7,000 dry samples in the second year. The number is expected to grow with the addition of nearly 7,500-15,000 compounds per year for the subsequent years.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

<DESC>This notice is a market survey and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.<BR><BR>a.  Description: This market survey seeks to identify potential sources to provide full life cycle support to ISEC projects.  ISECs projects involve system engineering and ancillary services for information and communication systems in support of the US Army, other Services, Department of Defense (DoD) components, and other Federal Government activities.  This work includes planning, design, development, engineering, implementation, logistics, evaluation, Information Assurance, and sustainment for information and communication systems.  The functional needs of ISEC include:  information and communication systems engineering; systems integration; information system security engineering and certification support; installation and testing; systems analysis; engineering surveys; installation support; transitional operations and maintenance support; information technology (IT) technical support; preparation of engineering publications and documentation; test and evaluation of information and communication systems and their associated IT components; quality control of information and communication systems design and implementation; technical instruction of information and communication systems; drafting and illustration support; technology demonstration and rapid prototyping capabilities.  ISEC may require these services at any location in the Continental United States (CONUS) or Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), to include theaters of operation in which the United States is engaged in conflicts.  ISEC is headquartered at Ft Huachuca, AZ, and has offices located at Ft Detrick, MD, Ft Lee, VA, and Ft Belvoir VA.  The total estimated value of this new Program, over an anticipated five year period, is $892M. This Program will subsume work previously performed by Signal Solutions, LLC, W9128Z-06-D-0001, NCI Information Systems, Inc., W9128Z-06-D-0002, and STG, Inc., W9128Z-06-D-0003.<BR><BR>b. Background Information and Other Considerations:<BR><BR>1.  ISEC presently receives support from an average of 700 Full Time Equivalent contractor personnel daily.  ISEC anticipates that this number will be sustained during the duration of this next Program period.   This is the total support being provided to the current ISEC Program which is supported by three prime contractors and their subcontractors.  <BR><BR>2.   Extensive contractor support is required world-wide.  In the first six months of Calendar Year 2009, ISEC contract support averaged 41 personnel per day deployed OCONUS to an average of 15 countries per month with an average of 17 personnel per day in Kuwait, 6 per day in Afghanistan, 1 per day in Iraq, 6 per day in Germany, 2 per day in Japan, 3 per day in Korea and other personnel in many other countries around the world on an infrequent basis. CONUS deployments alone were extensive.  In view of the global nature of the required services, the contractor(s) may determine that multiple field offices would be required in order to perform successfully. Based on the above, contractor(s) must be able to deploy and manage multiple concurrent teams world-wide to support numerous projects within each of ISECs eight offices and one Technical Services Group in any or all of the aforementioned functional areas.    <BR><BR>3.  The environment in which this work will be conducted can range from fully developed and supported by modern facilities to austere locations with no modern infrastructure and in areas with low threat potential up to and including areas of active conflict.  Some of the projects are efforts which require continuous support lasting multiple years without a gap in support or loss of knowledge due to personnel movements. Some projects include providing resources on short notice for short periods of time.<BR><BR>4. As a minimum contractor personnel must meet the favorable trustworthiness background requirements contained in AR 25-1 and AR 380-67. In a majority of ISEC work, Secret clearances are a minimum requirement, with some Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) requirements.  Additionally, Presidential Support Billet requirements must be supported for approximately 15 personnel.  Pass rate for pre-screened candidates (TS/SCI with good financial status) is less than 60% for Presidential Support Billet Positions.<BR><BR>5.  Following is a brief description of ISECs business model.  ISEC receives requests for services from other government components throughout the year without much notice. ISEC prepares a cost estimate and workplan for the requesting organization. Upon acceptance of the proposed workplan and receipt of funding, ISEC then solicits contract support through a Task Order (TO) and Performance Work Statement (PWS).  In many cases, the actual conditions under which the work is to be performed or the amount of work required is not truly known until ISEC government or contractor personnel arrive on-site and begin an assessment of actual work and conduct site surveys. Flexibility and good communications are key to successful teaming with ISEC.     <BR> <BR>6. An Informational Draft PWS and a sample Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) which demonstrate the concept of surveillance by the Government on performance based acquisitions will be available in the reading room of the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) on or about 15 January 2010.  A prime contractor(s) must have the ability to provide services that meet all of the requirements identified by ISEC in the Informational Draft PWS.  The contractor(s) assumes total responsibility to ensure all requirements of individual TOs are satisfied.  The contractor(s) shall ensure that it can provide personnel with sufficient training, experience, and expertise to meet all the functions and tasks identified in TOs as well as current and emerging technologies in the information and communication systems field that ISEC may need.  Prime contractor(s) must provide sufficient qualified personnel to deploy anywhere in CONUS and OCONUS as required by individual TOs.  The contractor(s) shall be responsible for ensuring continuous support to ISEC.  This must take into account personnel situations affecting support such as:  training periods, emergencies, health related issues, and authorized time off.   ISEC may require short-notice support requiring boots on the ground contractor support anywhere in the world within 72 hours of notification of award of a TO.  Contractor personnel required to travel in support of this program must be able to obtain credit cards to support travel requirements.  <BR><BR>7.  Contractor(s) must be able to meet all travel requirements for sending personnel to foreign countries where Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), visa requirements, work force policies, to include Technical Expert Status Accreditation (TESA),  medical standards and other factors may impede their ability to move people quickly to any location world-wide that requires ISEC support.<BR><BR>8.  Experience indicates that the contractor(s) must have a strong management and administrative team. They must be able to synchronize contract support activities, personnel deployment, information, processes, procedures and quality of support across multiple time zones and support locations.  <BR><BR>9.  The prime contractor(s) must be able to provide performance and accounting metrics to ISEC that demonstrate the price, quality, efficiency and timeliness of their support in accomplishing the requirements of ISEC.  Additionally, in accordance with DoD and Department of Army (DA) policy, the contractor(s) must ensure that all of their supporting information systems that receive, process, store, display or transmit DoD information, regardless of mission assurance category, classification or sensitivity meet DA standards.  Personnel supporting Information Assurance tasks under this contract must also meet DoD 8570 Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program requirements.<BR><BR>10.  The contractor(s) must be able to provide provisioning support, to include purchasing of incidental items, storing, pre-configuration and repair/replacement support for hardware and software for the IT requirements of a major headquarters relocation.  Additionally, the contractor(s) must be able to provide secure receiving, shipping and storage capabilities for classified, sensitive, and unclassified equipment and information, to include cryptography equipment, protected distribution hardware and equipment, cabling and heavy General Services Administration-certified safes.<BR><BR>11.  Should an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract be awarded for support of the ISEC Program, TOs are envisioned to be Firm-Fixed-Price and Time and Materials. This is subject to further consideration.<BR><BR>c.  Submission Items: <BR><BR>Parties interested in competing for this effort are asked to provide the following information:<BR><BR>1.  A statement of interest in competing for this Program to include identification of whether you intend to compete as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor.  For those who have reviewed the Informational Draft PWS, QASP, and the Background and Other Considerations above and have decided not to compete, your comments on why you would not compete would be appreciated.<BR><BR>2.  In no more than five pages, please describe your ability to meet the complete requirements of the Informational Draft PWS under the conditions described in the Background and Considerations above.  <BR><BR>3.  If you intend to compete, please provide:<BR><BR>      a)  In no more than two pages, a statement which describes and demonstrates your ability to successfully participate as a Prime Contractor on this Program.  Also indicate the percentage of work you intend to perform with company resources, as well as the percentage of work you intend to subcontract, broken out by large and small business sub-contractor categories. <BR>      <BR>      b)  In no more than one page, a statement addressing the following:<BR>      <BR>      1) Your resources and history supporting similar work at numerous overseas locations simultaneously.<BR><BR>      2) Your familiarity with SOFA and TESA agreements and identify the countries. <BR><BR>      3) Your familiarity with working in limited, if not nonexistent, infrastructure locations OCONUS.<BR><BR>4.  If you are a small business, indicate:  The number of employees and value of annual receipts under the identified North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, whether you are self-certified or Small Business Administration certified. Identify if you intend to compete as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor, which type(s) of small business you are (e.g., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned) and a description of which elements of the PWS described above you cannot meet with your own work force.<BR><BR>5.  If you are a large business, please provide a rough outline of your small business participation plan, not to exceed two pages, that describes how you would integrate small business into accomplishing the required support of ISEC.<BR><BR>6.  Provide no more than one page of comments on the proposed labor categories and staffing plan discussed in section 3.3.2 of the Informational Draft PWS.  Input is being sought from industry on labor category identification and descriptions as well as the use and approval of technical and functional specialists which may be outside of the defined labor categories or skill levels. Please feel free to make suggestions of labor categories and their descriptions based on the upcoming draft PWS.<BR><BR>7.  Provide no more than one page of comments and recommendations on the upcoming Informational Draft PWS and on how the Government can improve the process and documents for this Program.<BR><BR>8.

S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a Contract on a sole source basis with Safariland, Inc. 13386 International Parkway Jacksonville, FL 32218.  This will be for the purchase of 200 units of model M97 soft armor in a reduced area of coverage configuration for R&D ballistic testing ranging in size from small to X-Large.  Reducing area of coverage will potentially give United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) operators reduced weight and increased mobility on the battlefield. Model M97 soft armor is a commercial item that is solely manufactured by Safariland and is the only currently approved and manufactured soft armor provided to the Special Operations Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) operators. No other model of soft armor will satisfy the requirements of this ballistic test. No first article test is required as this soft armor will not be fielded for use by soldiers under combat conditions. Testing will be conducted for the purpose of determining whether to execute an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to an existing production contract which was previously competed full and open.  Safariland is the only known source of model M97 soft armor and owns the proprietary rights to the design and manufacturing. Model M97 soft armor is the only currently approved and manufactured soft armor provided to the Special Operations Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) operators and no other model of soft armor will satisfy the requirements of this purchase.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NCD will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price purchase order to SEK Solutions.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  Any Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Nate Jordan or by email to: Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil.  This synopsis expires January 15, 2010 at 10:00am.

The Office of Freight Management and Operations is contemplating award of an IDIQ to place greater emphasis on the need for freight expertise.

Section 4.  Nature of Work

A. Background

The Federal Highway Administration is a major agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), a cabinet-level organization of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government.  FHWA is charged with the broad responsibility of ensuring that America’s roads and highways continue to be the safest and most technologically up-to-date. Although State, local, and tribal governments own most of the Nation’s highways, FHWA provides financial and technical support to them for constructing, improving, and preserving America’s highway system. 

Within the FHWA, the Office of Freight Management and Operations promotes efficient freight movement on the U.S. transportation system and across our borders. Efficient freight movement is important to our nation's economic competitiveness and to our global connectivity.  To advance this mission, the Office: 
•	Conducts policy and applied research 
•	Develops analytical tools and data integration
•	Develops and advances technology applications that improve the efficiency of freight movement 
•	Engages in technology transfer
•	Develops and administers a professional capacity building program that improves the knowledge and ability of transportation professionals to address freight movement 
•	Administers national level programs that address freight movement (e.g.,  Projects of National and Regional Significance, National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement, Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot, and Truck Parking) 
•	Administers Federal truck size and weight requirements. 
Together, these activities build a greater understanding of freight transportation issues and trends, foster public/private partnerships, improve operations through advanced technologies, and educate and train transportation professionals. 

B.  State of Freight and Challenges 
The projected increase in freight movement over the next twenty plus years will increasingly strain the Nation’s transportation network including intermodal and global connectivity.  Ensuring that freight continues to move efficiently on the US transportation network is critical to the nation’s economic health.  

The economic benefits that accrue at the local, regional and national levels come with challenges that need to be addressed, e.g., emissions, energy consumption, congestion, modal productivity, local costs/benefits relative to more dispersed benefits.  These challenges are not unique to the highway system but present themselves across the transportation network on all modes. 

The movement of freight is a complicated system involving multiple governmental organizations at all levels, private interests that control the assets that move the freight, and, of course, the beneficial owners of the freight itself.  All need to work together to ensure that the transportation system functions effectively and efficiently for all.  

Understanding the dynamics of this movement and the relationship of all the players is necessary for transportation decision makers.  The freight transportation challenge is decidedly different from urban commuting and other passenger travel in several ways:
•	Freight moves long distances through localities and responds to distant economic demands while the majority of passenger travel occurs between local origins and destinations. Freight movement may generate local costs that exceed local benefits. 
•	Freight movements fluctuate more quickly and in greater relative amounts than passenger travel. While both passenger travel and freight respond to long-term demographic change, freight responds more quickly than passenger travel to short-term economic fluctuations. Fluctuations can be national or local. The addition or loss of just one major business can dramatically change the level of freight activity in a locality. 
•	Freight movement is heterogeneous compared to passenger travel. Patterns of passenger travel tend to be very similar across metropolitan areas and among large economic and social strata. The freight transportation demands of farms, steel mills, and clothing boutiques differ radically from one another. Solutions aimed at average conditions are less likely to work because the freight demands of economic sectors vary widely. 
•	Improvements targeted at freight demand are needed as freight accounts for a larger share of the transportation system, and as improvements targeted at general traffic or passenger travel are less likely to aid the flow of freight as an incidental by-product. 

C.   Objectives
As the FHWA’s resource for freight transportation and as a major contributor to US DOT freight policy and programs, the Office of Freight Management and Operations is seeking to identify sources that can provide support services related to:  

1.	Support to staff in understanding freight issues, trends,and market dynamics.

2.	Support to staff in the development and application of technology to more efficiently move freight.

3.	Support to staff in the development of policy, programs, projects, and regulations that advance freight management and operations.

4.	Support to staff for communications activities, including marketing and outreach to raise awareness, understanding, and the application of freight management and operations concepts.

5.	Support to staff for the development and use of data integration, analytic and technical tools, user interfaces, models, and  interactive and asynchronous instruction to advance freight programs.

6.	Support to staff for technology transfer and technical assistance programs to state and local transportation professionals to facilitate application of freight programs.

7.	Support to staff for program assessment of freight programs and projects, including project evaluation, performance measurement, finance, and process improvement related to freight programs.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to HDR Engineering, Inc. (HDR), for a new Architect-Engineer contract.  The contract will be an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contract for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  Work will be assigned by negotiated task orders. While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,600,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than $1,600,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $8,000,000.00 for the life of the contract, including options.  HDR is the Designer of Record of the design of the C-44 Reservoir and STA project through the South Florida Water Management District ACCELER8 Program.  To date, HDR has performed extensive hydrologic analysis and modeling for this project.  They performed the Basis of Design Report and the plans and specifications (P&S) design of the intake canal, reservoir, pump station, storm water treatment areas, access roads, communications tower, cut off wall, new bridge on citrus blvd and new culvert under citrus blvd.  Plans and Specifications were completed to the final phase for construction advertisement as a single construction contract.  The Government is repackaging this single construction contract into three separate contracts; Intake canal works (1), Reservoir and Pump Station (2) and Storm Water Treatment Areas (3).  HDR is currently converting the P&S for contract 1 under an IDIQ contract with St Paul District.  Due to the performance requirements of the original contract, HDR has accumulated knowledge and expertise on this project that is not available from any other firm.  It would be very costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new consultant's knowledge base of the C-44 Reservoir and STA Project.  The proposed contract shall consist of providing engineering services to complete the C-44 Reservoir and STA Project in compliance with USACE standards.  The engineering services shall include hydraulic and hydrologic analysis, design, preparation of P&S, incorporating changes from BCOE reviews, Engineering During Construction (EDC) and miscellaneous engineering services for the C-44 Reservoir and STA.  Additional work that remains is the P&S conversion and design work for contract 2 and 3, BCOE changes for contract 2 and 3 and EDC for all 3 contracts.  Interested concerns should contact Pamela Shirley at 904-232-1992; (or email at pamela.j.shirley@usace.army.mil) for information on submitting documentation demonstrating their qualifications to accomplish this project.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLANSHOLDER.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D MAINTENANCE SERVICES, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for to continue to with the requirement to de-water, clean, inspect, and repair Selden and Bankhead Locks.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the job as a result of the failure of government-owned equipment and a flood event.  2)  The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  3) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  4)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<SUBJECT>Air Force Utility Privatization Effort for Natural Gas Distribution System at Westover ARB
<SOLNBR>FA3002-08-R-0032
<RESPDATE>010509
<ARCHDATE>01092009

<DESC>*******Please note that the synopsis for this requirement was posted 20 Aug 08 under the same solicitation number; however, it was posted under the incorrect Contracting Office. Due to the fact that this has been posted over 30 days, the CO has determined that the FAR 5 requirement has been met and is issuing the solicitation.********

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Westover ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts at the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  There are no items specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization.
Natural gas is supplied to Westover ARB by Bay State Gas through two metering points. One metering point is near the Central Ave. Gate (Building 2765). A second metering point is at the Westover Club. The meters are owned by Bay State Gas. The main distribution system receives gas at approximately 50 pounds per square inch gauge (PSIG). Natural gas is used to meet space and water heating requirements on Base. The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB has no pressure problems during peak winter loads. Bay State Gas maintains odorization at the metering points. 
A study of the capacity of the natural gas system at Westover ARB to support future operations when BRAC related mission additions are complete was finalized in February 2008.  This study concluded that the proposed capital projects represent a potential increase in peak gas flow of about 76 percent compared to the existing theoretical peak flow, and that several modifications were recommended to allow the existing system to accommodate the increased demand.   
The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB consists of polyethylene (PE) pipe that is owned by Westover ARB. Natural gas utility mains and service lines are approximately 3 to 6 feet below grade.   Valves are also made of plastic.  Some of the pipe is buried with marker tape and tracer wire, but a majority of the system does not have marker tape or functioning tracer wire because it was installed using jack and bore techniques.
 The distribution system is looped so that most buildings can be fed from at least two different paths. There are no cathodic protection or odorization facilities at Westover ARB.  A short segment of metal pipe delivers natural gas to the west side of building 3505 on the north side of the base.  This pipe does not have cathodic protection so it is being programmed for replacement.

Planting in the Field:  Field Site is located in the Curlew Valley, in southwest corner of Oneida County, near the Idaho-Utah border.  Four to six specific planting sites that comprise lands burned by wildfires since 2002.  Topography is flat to gently rolling foothills.    Handling and Planting of Seedlings: Handling and planting procedures will be followed to minimize dehydration or damage to the planting materials before and during planting; e.g. seedling roots will be maintained moist and packed to minimize seedling dehydration; the day of planting, plant materials will be soaked in water prior to planting; plant materials will be planting into holes or furrows deep enough to minimize the frequency of J-rooting when the seedlings are placed in the soil.  Soil will be replaced and packed around the seedling to ensure good soil-to-root contact to facilitate seedling establishment.    Planting Configuration: Furrows would be spaced about 10 ft. apart.  Within furrows, plants would be spaced about 8-10 ft. apart.  Spatially, plant density would be expected to range between about 440 and 680 plants per acre, with a median density of about 550 plants per acre.    Season of Planting: Planting would occur in late autumn 2010, i.e. about early November through mid-December, or in early spring 2011; i.e. late March or earlier, through late April.  Planting in late autumn would be preferable to early spring planting.  If it should become necessary to plant in the spring of 2011, planting should be performed, the earlier the better.    A 4WD tractor of at least 80 bhp would be required to pull the BLM seedling planter (below).
Government Furnished Materials:The BLM would have available to the vendor, a two-person seedling planter with a standard three-point hitch.

(See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<BR>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<BR>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<BR>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<BR>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<BR>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<BR>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<BR>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<BR>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<BR>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<BR>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<BR>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<BR>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<BR>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<BR>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<BR>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<BR>determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<BR>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<BR>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<BR>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR> UNIFORM ALLOWANCE <BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</span></p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

This is the same effort as FA8604-09-R-7024 however changes have been made to the PWS. 
Please note in the attachment Model Contract # FA8604-10-R-7000, it contains Section L and M as inter-document attachments, however they are attached separately to this solicitation for quick review.

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<BR>Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay<BR>in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR<BR>4.174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<BR>FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.<BR><BR><BR>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<BR>or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<BR>an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<BR>wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<BR>with the following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<BR>actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<BR>is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<BR>subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<BR>collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<BR>furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<BR>employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<BR>cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<BR>made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<BR>personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<BR>cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<BR>cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<BR>by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<BR>that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR><BR>** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **<BR><BR>Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the<BR>Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes,<BR>prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only<BR>upon such contingencies as approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage<BR>determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract,<BR>adjusting the contract price, etc. (The relevant CBA section) in the collective<BR>bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that<BR>Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting arm's length negotiation under<BR>section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage<BR>determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits<BR>paid under the predecessor contract.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<BR>Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<BR>http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<BR>Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<BR>Form 1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<BR>is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<BR>work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<BR>the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<BR>initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<BR>unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<BR>fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<BR>{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<BR>contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<BR>which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<BR>order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<BR>each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<BR>wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<BR>the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<BR>authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<BR>submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<BR>class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<BR>report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<BR>Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<BR>Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<BR>process the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<BR>contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<BR>paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<BR>the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<BR>tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<BR>determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<BR>subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Questions on NFFKPR00-10-04974
<p>1). However, without knowing the number of individuals who will be appointed to the Take Reduction Team and a firm number of days that the Take Reduction Team will meet, it is impossible to provide a competitive quotation, comparable to other offeror's quotation without such information especially since the contractor "shall be required to reimburse all travel and per diem related expenses of the team members and invited participants or their alternatives for their attendance at the meeting". The statement of task further notes that "that the meeting will be scheduled for 2-3 consecutive days, not including weekends."</p>
<p>2). If "all responsible sources" are not using the same number of participants or meeting days, how can the Request for Quotation be judged "as the most advantageous to the Government, price...?"</p>
<p>3). I would appreciate a response to this email regarding the numbers requested or if all offerors are not using the same numbers, how will the quotation be evaluated.</p>
<p><br />Answers</p>
<p>(1) 8 Team members will require roundtrip airfare to Hawaii; <br />(2) an additional 8 Team members will require roundtrip airfare within the Hawaiian Islands; and <br />(3) all 16 members will require per-diem and hotel for all meetings.</p>
<p>Please tell requestor to note assumptions and we will evaluate accordingly.</p>

<DESC>A. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions and to state date and time for cutoff for questions.
 - Can we use small format cameras such as 35 mm and 2 1/4 x 2 1/4 cm or 6 x 9 cm?
   Response
   Large-format is the only acceptable standard for HABS/HAER/HALS photographic documentation.
 - Or are we required to use 4x5 cameras; 5x7 or 8x10 cameras?
   Response
   Any of the three, although 8 x 10 might be very cumbersome travel wise.
 - For inside photography, are we required to use special lighting to make the scene as natural as possible?  Or         can we use strobe lights?  
   Response
   Inside photography is minimal in this project( estimated at less than 5%).  For those interior photographs, special     lighting to make the scene as natural as possible will be required. 
   GPS accuracy at 3 meters.  Is reference to the location where the photograph is taken for each picture?  Or just    for the location in general?
   Response
   GPS location is for each image.
  The SOW requests 36 photographs per location.  Does that mean only 36 pictures can more than 36 photographs   be taken and then select 36 photographs from the proof sheet prior to making conversion of the negatives to 400   dpi files for each photo? 
  Response
  The photographer may take as many images the photographer feels is necessary, but the contract is for 36       images per site.  Contractor will be paid only for those submitted and accepted.   
  The length of stay is 1 week per location.  What about arranging for dates to visit each location?  
  Response
  The length of stay is estimated to be 1 week per location, due to inclement weather, the time may be longer.  The    project will be coordinated with the American Battle Monuments Commission (AMBC) and cemetery staff to       arrange access, etc, but scheduling is the responsibility of the photographer.
  Weather conditions in this environment could be rain, snow and very overcast.  Are photographs of the     cemeteries during snow and rain conditions allowed?  
  Response
  Rain and snow photographs would be unacceptable.
  A period of three months for travel to Europe, travel between cemetery sites as well as field work (photography    of the cemeteries).  This means we have to travel to Europe during the 3 months or do you have specific dates?
  Response
  It is expected that travel to Europe, travel between the various cemetery sites and field work will take three     months; however, the overall period of performance is nine months as broken down in amendment 01 to the     synopsis and provided below:
  The period of performance is nine months broken down as follows:
  Month 1 - Travel to Europe, Site Travel and Field Work 	Month 6 - Printing of Contacts/Scanning  Month 2 - Site Travel and Field Work 	                                Month 7 - Printing of Contacts/Scanning  Month 3 - Site Travel, Field Work and Return Travel 	Month 8 - Photo Captions and HALS                                 Month 4 - Laboratory Development of Photography 	Month 9 - PAYMENT - Final payment based on    Month 5 - Laboratory Development of Photography             successful completion and acceptance of the 	                                                                                HALS photographs per the contract deliverables.   Do proof sheets have to be submitted from 1 location to another or must the whole job be supplied at once?  Response
 Proof sheets have to be submitted at the same time.
 Will clearance be made by the National Park Service (NPS) with the FBI, TSA be made so the film is not exposed   to heavy radiation from x-ray machines that could conceivably, destroy or damage all the files.   Also, will the   contractor be cleared by Customs going into France, Belgium and England?  And upon return cleared with the    customs at U.S. Port of Entry?
 Response
 Clearances will be the responsibility of the photographer.  There will be no special clearances provided.
  Is it possible to receive samples?
  Response
  The NPS is not able to provide samples.
B.  The cutoff date and time for receipt of questions was January 8, 2010 at 12:00 Eastern Standard Time (EST).

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) Extends the end date of the BAA to 31 January 201; (b) Adds FY11 white paper submission date; and (c) Restructures funding profile. Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing. No other changes have been made.
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 1 Aug 05; FY 07 by 1 Aug 06; FY 08 by 1 Aug 07; FY 09 by 1 Aug 08, FY 10 by 1 Aug 09, and FY 11 by 15 Jun 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 31 Jan 11, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Motion imagery and conventional imagery both provide visual data sources for intelligence gathering purposes through the use of various exploitation technologies and methodologies that demand high performance and dynamic operations to meet mission tasking and exploitation timelines. Data formats, sensor type and spectral characteristics are the determining factors that dictate the exploitation technologies that will be required to process the data and extract the information to obtain the mission objectives. The streaming video data format require different strategies for processing motion imagery over conventional two dimensional imaging sensors, but these sensors also differ with some being active or passive and spectral range of operation that require other processing and exploitation considerations. Although motion imagery and conventional imagery have differing requirements with respect to the implementation of the processing strategies, the types of processing strategies can be very similar. These imagery collection systems and the resultant data are exploited by teams of analysts, operational and warfighter personnel. Exploitation often includes object or target detection, material identification and producing a report. The goal of this research and development activity is to produce better tools and procedures to support exploitation operations in deriving more accurate and timely information from motion imagery and conventional imagery sources. Specific areas include:</p>
<p>Ability to ingest, visualize, process, exploit and output imagery products in standard and planned data formats for motion imagery and conventional imagery sources. These formats shall include evolving new data structure and compression schema standards.</p>
<p>Improved procedures for performing graphics annotation to create embedded non-destructive graphic, symbology and textual layers to accompany motion imagery or conventional image data files in standardized formats.</p>
<p>Object tracking paradigms that provide technologies for continuous real time object tracking of both stationary and moving targets of opportunity. These technologies shall address the conditions where the target is temporarily obscured by intervening objects or shadows and then reappears. Tracking shall be accomplished through graphic, text and symbolic overlays and shall also calculate speed and direction parameters for the target.</p>
<p>Enhanced algorithms to perform feature extraction and image segmentation. These algorithms are required to provide enclosed line segment boundaries outlining targets and objects of interest in order to compute statistics for characterizing the feature's shape, size, material content and other identifying information for pattern recognition purposes and to support object tracking paradigms.</p>
<p>Optimized techniques for analysts to produce coherent change detection and two color multi-view products from synthetic aperture radar sources.</p>
<p>Refined spectral analysis capabilities to perform anomaly detection, surface material identification, atmospheric correction and the use of common signature libraries for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.</p>
<p>Two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualization capabilities to support the presentation of multiple intelligence data sources, including motion imagery (e.g., visible, IR, etc.), imagery, maps, elevation data, text, graphics and symbology, in a common geospatial reference for exploitation purposes.</p>
<p>Effective methodologies for deriving accurate geo-positioning information and performing precise mensuration in which operations span the use of diverse data sets and evolving concepts such as smart images.</p>
<p>Software design and development strategies that follow accepted standards and provide intuitive motion imagery and conventional imagery exploitation tools for the analyst and implement and support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) oriented scenario concepts such as publish and subscribe mechanisms.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $10M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.8M; FY 07 - $1.8M; FY 08 - $1.8M; FY 09 - $1.8M; FY10 - $1.8M; and FY11 - $1M.

<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC Name: Jonathan Gregory<br />Telephone: (315) 330-4294 <br />Email: Jonathan.Gregory@rl.af.mil</p>

<DESC><p>Amendment 04:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">The purpose of this amendment is to revise the close date (for purposes of second round submissions) of DARPA-BAA-09-51 to 11 January 2010. <br /></span><br /><br />Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing power-efficient and remotable high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with high resolution. The proposed program (Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converters with De-serialization and Reconstruction or RADER) research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in analog-to-digital conversion. ADC systems enabled by RADER technology will be capable of operating in continuous time over a 10 GHz input instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution of 10 effective number of bits (ENOB). Ultimately, it is desirable to be able to place the 10 GHz IBW so that input signals with frequency content of up to 18 GHz are captured. However, RADER technology demonstrations will focus on 10 GHz IBW at baseband (all Phases) in addition to 6 GHz IBW centered at 15 GHz (Phase III). Of particular interest is achieving these impressive goals within a dense input signal environment while simultaneously limiting the amount of dc power consumed to less than 50 Watts. Furthermore, in most applications, it is advantageous to sense analog waveforms at a point remoted from the components or subsystems that require significant portions of the power budget. The realization of such a continuous time analog-to-digital (A/D) system would create a unique new capability beyond the range of existing ADCs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-51@darpa.mil. See full BAA document attached.</p>

Purpose===========During the launch of the Educate to Innovate Campaign in November 2009, the Presidentcalled for the expansion of science, technology, engineering and mathematicsopportunities for all young people.  NASA is launching Summer of Innovation to increasethe scope and scale of the Agencys commitment to answer the Presidents call.	Summer ofInnovation is designed to improve STEM teaching and learning in partnership with federalagencies, philanthropic institutions, universities, industry, museums, nonprofitorganizations, and states and localities.  Overview===========Summer of Innovation is a five (5)-week STEM summer learning program that will launch andculminate in a national event. The objectives of the Summer of Innovation will beaccomplished by the strategic infusion of NASA content and products into existing,evidence-based summer learning programs at the state level. Additionally, the programwill involve design competitions and flagship events open to students and teachersnationwide.  NASA will use the Summer of Innovation as a catalyst to expand, align, andstrengthen existing state-based networks.  Summer of Innovations support will align withthe common core standards movement and connect to schools and others to maximize learningand development outcomes with the goal of keeping students on pathways to learning andlife success.  This strategy will ensure a more powerful and equitable strategy tomaximize the chances that all children will have the range of learning opportunities theyneed to meet high academic standards and to succeed not only in school but in the 21stcentury global economy and society. The 2010 NASA Summer of Innovation pilot program will provide complementary learningsupport during the summer that engages middle school teachers and students in a STEMlearning program that will ultimately increase the number of future scientists,mathematicians, and engineers in our nation.  The pilot program will seek to improve STEMperformance for a diverse population of students (entering sixth grade and completingninth grade), placing them on a trajectory to take calculus by senior year of high schooland be prepared for a STEM major in college.Summer of Innovation will align with the key design principles under the United StatesDepartment of Educations Race to the Top and Investing in Innovation (i3)incentive-based grant programs: public/private partnership to build rigorous STEMpathways; work with STEM partners to advance STEM instruction and application in theclassroom; and prepare more students - particularly females and low-income and minoritypopulations  to enter STEM professions.Anticipated Timeline================	       ITEM		 Open Date	Close DateNotice of Intent to Proposers	06-Jan-2010	19-Jan-2010Summer of Innovation Pilot CAN	19-Jan-2010	19-Feb-2010Pre-Proposal Teleconference	25-Jan-2010	25-Jan-2010Non-binding NOI to Propose Due	27-Jan-2010	27-Jan-2010Proposals Due			19-Feb-2010	19-Feb-2010Proposal Review-Selection	25-Feb-2010	March 2010Award Announcement		 March 2010	March 2010Timeline is subject to change; current information will be posted on NASA NSPIRES andGrants.Gov Critical Elements for Proposers========================  Possess existing state-based partnerships and capacity to expand network  Goals and objectives aligned with intent of Summer of Innovation  Access to and experience engaging the Nations high quality STEM professionals throughindustry, academia and government (including NASA Centers and Mission Directorates)  Experience engaging diverse population of middle school students (with particularattention to underserved and underrepresented students) and accelerating their academicperformance  Capacity to provide unique and innovative hands-on experiences to students  Broad geographic representation of service providers   Experience implementing state-based STEM education programs  Capacity to sustain state-based STEM education programs over timeThe Agencys intent is that the pilot program will demonstrate success of the concept andutilize the best practices to implement the Summer of Innovation in FY2011 on a nationallevel.

<DESC>Revised Pre-Solicitation Notice
(This notice has been corrected from the initial posting to reflect the appropriate anticipated release date of the solicitation.  No other changes have been made)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD) is seeking contractor support on a requirement entitled Recovery & Reuse of Metals from Mining Influenced Water. This requirement involves removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse. The Rocky Mountains host thousands of abandoned mines with exposed metals-laden rock. Interaction of water with these rocks has resulted in acidic rock drainage and other environmental problems, including the potential for severe damage to the aquatic ecosystems posing a potential threat to human health. Water treatment facilities are in use in this region to extract heavy metals such that water will not cause further problems downstream. However, these treatment facilities are expensive and generate large quantities of sludge resulting in additional mining activities to acquire these metals for new production. 
The purpose of this research project is to address the challenges of removing metals from mining influenced water in a form that would allow for reuse of the metals thus reducing operations and maintenance costs at the mines by decreasing the volume of sludge requiring disposal. This project includes a research component for this study with modifications to an existing technology to meet the goals/objectives. Water chemistry parameters (pH, alkalinity (low), hardness (high), ionic strength (generally high), temperature (high altitude locations), and rapid precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides) vary in mining-influenced watersheds, possibly causing an existing technology to require these alterations. While non-alkaline-chemical treatment technologies exist for removal of metals from mining-influenced water, few field implementations are known for the use of treating acid-mine drainage water for reuse. 
The EPA is seeking a contractor to (1) use existing technology in a 2 month field pilot study to attain a reduction in waste sludge of at least 30% relative to traditional chemical treatments (e.g., final water content of 25% or less) with a 95-99% recovery efficiency for target metals (Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), and an effluent water having metals concentrations at or below water standards, (2) make the technology pilot ready within the first 6 months of the project start date, and (3) find a smelter that will accept the material created for recovery and reuse of the metals. 
The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to span a maximum 2 year duration.  We anticipate that the solicitation will be posted for 30 days beginning in late January. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis, with no small business set-aside. A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487- 2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01272011
<DESC>The US Forest Service, Siuslaw National Forest, intends to issue a sole source contract for management services of sewage treatment plants and water systems with the City of Yachats, Yachats, OR.  The services to be provided include: reading and recording of pump meters, inspect all major components, clean trash from grates, filters, and piping; record chlorine levels in various tanks; test samples and based on results, take corrective action if needed; respond to alarms; and complete and submit periodic Oregon State Department of Quality (DEQ) and Department of Labor reports.  The City of Yachats will maintain the DEQ permit and will be identified as the “Operator of Charge” for the various sites listed within the Solicitation.
The City of Yachats, through its Public Works Department, is available to provide services in the management of a sewage treatment plant operation since it maintains a similar treatment plant and has certified operators.   Other factors for the sole source include the complexity of maintaining and operating such plants, previous market survey shows there are no other certified operators within the area, and the work requires daily services, including  weekends, holidays and late night emergencies.   The City of Yachats past performance shows they are capable of providing such services in an efficient and professional manner.   The U.S. Forest Service, Siuslaw National Forest, intends to issue a firm-fixed price for the services stated.   
This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6-302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.   
The solicitation number assigned to this effort is R6-12-10-360113 and the contract resulting from the solicitation will be issued on or about fifteen (15) days after release of this notice.  An award date is anticipated by January 27, 2010.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  The NAICS code is 221320.

In addition, much time and effort is spent customizing several hundred software applications to properly and securely operate on the DoDIIS/DIA network. Once the particular make and model passes this rigorous testing and has customized software prepared, DIA IT personnel can quickly install, manage, operate and maintain thousands of identical items in the identical manner. These key components from EMC are essential to the continued operations of several major systems. They are also required to maintain warranties and for ease of support service agreements. If the same make and model or system components cannot be repeatedly purchased, then DoDIIS IT personnel would have to repeat this process for each and every item purchased and each and every system component. </span></p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Batang">DIA owns the current makes and models supported by this warranty services requirement. EMC is the only authorized source of support for proprietary EMC equipment. DIA already has a large investment in this system administration, maintenance, support and operations. DIA does not have the resources to acquire or maintain multiple vendors' proprietary architectures. Any decision to change current models or system configuration will greatly impact the costs of hardware maintenance and life-cycle replacement by requiring additional funding for the necessary spare parts required for DIA's level of operational readiness. By acquiring this annual warranty, DIA will meet its redundancy requirement and continue to use compatible parts with the existing system allowing spare parts to be a back up for one another. </span></p>
