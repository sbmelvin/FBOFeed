<SUBJECT>A -- Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS) Workshop
<DESC>Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS) Workshop, SN03-14.  The Defense
Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a workshop on Precision Inertial Navigation Systems (PINS). The workshop will be held May 27, 2003, at the Executive Conference Center in Arlington, Virginia.  The workshop is intended to help multiple research communities self-assemble into viable research teams that can construct high-precision inertial navigation systems using ultra-cold atom interferometers. It is expected that teams will require expertise in atomic physics, optoelectronics, systems engineering, and inertial navigation.  The workshop agenda will feature several technology overview presentations by government personnel and summary overviews to facilitate interaction and team forming among the participants. Participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters along with very short summary overview presentations describing capabilities and needs to facilitate communications, interactions, and team prospecting. A short abstract of each poster presentation is required.  Please access the Workshop website for details including registration and abstract submission (see below).  The envisioned Precision Inertial Navigation System will be comprised of stable, high-bandwidth instruments locked to high-precision atom interferometers.  The atom interferometers will also be configured to provide full-tensor gravity gradient measurement, allowing on-board correction for gravity-induced positioning errors. Target instrument drift rates are <5 meters per hour, thereby requiring a firm understanding of trade-offs between increased IMU accuracy and more sensitive gravity gradient detection.  The PINS will utilize magneto-optical traps (MOT) or Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) to produce ultra-cold sources necessary for the atomic interferometers.  Both techniques utilize (as a minimum) optical and magnetic fields to repetitively (~1 Hz) produce several million confined atoms with temperatures of a few nanoKelvin.  These atoms would be launched into one of several types of atomic interferometers, in which changes in the atoms' phase accumulation can be measured, giving a high precision and accuracy measurement of both gravitational and platform acceleration.  In addition to the challenge of constructing such a navigation system, emphasis will be placed on producing a rugged, miniaturized instrument.  Advances in optoelectronics should prove crucial here, as the optical requirements for such systems are quite stringent, including low-noise, narrow-linewidth laser sources at either 780 nm or 850 nm, capable of both precise frequency locking and frequency modulation of tens of MHz. We envision this project will combine the expertise of physicists; signal processing and control mathematicians; and electronic, optical, and system engineers, as well as members of the navigation community. These scientists will be drawn from industry, academia and national laboratories. In particular, we would strongly encourage the participation of instrument manufacturers on the integrated teams, as well as system integrators familiar with inertial navigation technologies.  The event website is <http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=169>.  The workshop registration fee is $105.00 and includes all workshop activities including a continental breakfast and working lunch.  Registration cutoff is May 13, 2003, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  Space is limited and it is recommended that you register early.  For further administrative information, contact Tara Weeks (weekst@sainc.com - Subject:  PINS Workshop).  Please refer to the PINS Workshop in all correspondence.  This announcement is NOT a request for proposals. No solicitation document is available at this time.
