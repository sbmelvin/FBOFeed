Emergency Off (EMO) buttons labeled  quote mark NEUTRON ONLY, quote mark  which shall immediately return the source to the shielded position when pushed. The EMO shall be located in at least two easily accessible locations in the irradiation room as well as on the control panel. <br>  <br> b. At least one door switch/interlock which prevents exposure of the source if the door to the irradiation room is open, and shall return the source to the shielded position if the door to the irradiation room is opened during exposure. <br>  <br> c. If the controller encounters an error or detects hardware failure, an exposed source shall be returned to the shielded position and no source shall subsequently be able to be exposed. <br>  <br> d. A radiation warning light, provided and installed by the contractor, shall be located above the access door to the irradiation room. <br>  <br> e. Both a light indicating source position and an audible alarm which shall sound prior to source exposure shall be provided and installed by the contractor. The light and audible alarm shall be located on the primary irradiator shield. <br>  <br> f. The contractor shall provide an enable control on the control panel which must be enabled for the system to operate. <br>  <br> 3. Characterization. The contractor shall be responsible for initial characterization of each neutron source for neutron emission rate/dose equivalent rate. <br>  <br> 4. Installation. The contractor shall install the system in its entirety in the designated rooms of the Radiation Standards Laboratory (RSL), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The Government shall provide assistance with moving the primary irradiator shield into the irradiation room.  <br>  <br> 5. Training.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division in Philadelphia, intends to enter into negotiations, on a sole source basis, with General Electric Company, General Aircraft Engines Company, 1 Neumann Way, Cinncinnati, OH 45215-1988 to procure kit material in support of the NAVYs Aero Gas Turbine Engine(s).  This material includes the following:  (11) Tube, Drain, Air-Oil Separator, P/N L34771G01; (11) Tube, Discharge, Air-Oil Separator, P/N L34773G01; (11)  Bracket, Air-Oil Separator, P/N L34769P001A; (11) Cover, Pump, P/N RG35372-1; (11) Plate, Identification, P/N RD35372-1.  

The material to be procured must meet operational and reliability requirements, the achievement of which, require unique production techniques and testing.
  The Government has yet to acquire or develop the technical data in order to be able to solicite and have these items manufactured on the open market.  The materials to be purchased through this contract action are not commercial items but are designed, developed and solely manufactured by the General Electric Company.  As a result the proposed action cannot be processed on the basis of full and open competition since the Government does not possess full legal rights to the essential technical data in whole or in part.
  
The Government, therefore, intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.
  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 333611.
  
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any and all responses must be received within 15 days of this synopsis notice. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for procurement of high power/high voltage electronic components including, but not limited to, capacitors, resistors, power supplies, cables, magnetrons, other similar devices, spare parts and other similar support, for Directed Energy systems and other various developmental efforts.
  This synopsis is open to all business concerns; however, in accordance with FAR 19.501, the Governments intent is to establish BPAs with small businesses. In the event there arent enough responses from responsible, capable small businesses, then large business responses will be considered.  Individual call numbers shall not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $150,000. Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 will be utilized.  A BPA may be issued for a five-year period.  The Government reserves the right to add/delete vendors at any time throughout the life of the BPA. There is no minimum Government obligation.  In compliance with DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (MAR 2008), the government will utilize Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) (https://wawf.eb.mil/)    to electronically process vendor requests for payment.
  

Interested parties are requested to provide their Cage Code and DUNS numbers for verification of inclusion in the Central Contractor Registry.  VENDORS CURRENTLY HOLDING A BPA WITH NSWCDD DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Responsibility determinations will also precede issuance of a BPA and will be conducted in accordance with FAR 9.104.  Interested parties are encouraged to address the seven elements of responsibility contained in FAR 9.104 and to complete FAR Clause 52.219-1.  

BPAs will be issued on the basis of past performance.  Interested vendors should provide a minimum of five (5) past performance references.  These references should include name of business, address, phone number, point of contact, contract/purchase order number and item description.
  Past performance will be evaluated based upon quality and timeliness of delivery.  The government reserves the right to use additional past performance references if necessary.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination to Dahlgren, Virginia.  All BPA calls/orders shall be issued on a firm fixed price basis.  Companies interested in receiving a BPA shall submit the requested documentation no later than 15 February 2013 to the attention of Susan Staples, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110 or via email to: susan.staples@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAVSEA Indian Head on behalf of the Joint Staff (JS) intends to award a sole source contract to Grant Thornton LLP of Alexandria VA.  The intended contract would be in support of task order N00178-12-D-6886 FG01. Grant Thornton has been performing under this task order since 12/25/2012.  As part of their performance, a discovery phase has been completed which identified the need for additional support for Washington Headquarter Services (WHS) and the National Defense University (NDU), of which the JS is the ERP service provider.  For another company to provide these services, it would result in a substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through competition.
  In addition, awarding to another vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the audit readiness requirement.  It would take another contractor 6 months to get to the point where GT is, resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Therefore, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, the government intends to award a sole source contract for the additional support services to Grant Thornton.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  	VA Boston Healthcare System (BHS)
940	Belmont Street 
Brockton, MA  02360

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is for the sole source procurement of a firm fixed price purchase order with Standard Communication to purchase PBX equipment to support the expansion of VoIP Telephones for BHS in general and specifically our Boston Vet Center, Plymouth CBOC and Research leased Space at Harrison Ave in Boston. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  VA Boston Vet Center is moving into a new space, VA BHS is opening a new CBOC in Plymouth MA, and is leasing a new space on Harrison Ave Boston for its Research Department.  It was decided that the most cost effective method to provide phone service to these locations was to use VoIP technology.  This offered the advantages of not having to buy and install additional phone switches for location, would allow staff to use a single Voicemail system that they currently use and are familiar with, continue to use 5 digit dialing to call any phone at any of the BHS Medical Centers or Clinics, and also allow for our existing phone operators to answer calls as appropriate.  VISN 1 currently has a Task Order in place for Standard communication to maintain the entire PBX systems network wide and provide On-Site Technicians.  VA BHS currently has their PBX systems (5 Medical Centers and 4 clinics) under warranty with Standard Communication. If another contractor was to come in and provide the equipment or installation that warranty would be voided costing the government thousands in service repairs. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;
?

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Standard Communication currently holds the warranty and maintenance contract for our PBX phone systems through a VISN wide GSA Task Order under GS-35F-0511T.  If another contractor was allowed to supply the equipment or the installation that warranty would be voided, and Standard Communication would no longer be held responsible for any failure of the system under the maintenance contract as they would not be the only contractor accessing the system. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  At this time, no additional efforts will be made to obtain competition for this requirement as that would void the warranty of the VA BHS PBX System.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Though the equipment under this requirement is open market, Standard Communications is offering it to the Government at discounted pricing.  Therefore, pricing is deemed fair and reasonable.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Additional market research was not conducted due to the warranty and VISN wide Task Order established under GS-35F-0511T. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Equipment purchased from Standard Communications Inc would be covered under the current warranty of the VA BHS PBX System.  Additionally, Standard Communications Inc is a VetBiz verified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None - See Section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  This is a one-time procurement. The VISN 1 NCO Contracting Officer working the PBX contract will address adding the purchase of equipment to that contract to eliminate the requirement to do a sole source acquisition for each equipment purchase in the future.  As new requirements arise, the BHS will review and evaluate other equipment that can meet the Government's needs.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) has a requirement for the following: <br>  <br> The Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) has tasked the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) to direct a medical research program.  As a function of this process, the Headquarters, USAMRMC receives scientific proposals, progress reports, and similar intramural documents from the Command's research laboratories and extramurally from the academic and scientific research community.  Each of these documents is reviewed for program relevance and, where appropriate, for scientific merit.  Peer review, a process of self-regulation involving evaluation by qualified individuals within the relevant field, is the mechanism used by the command to execute these reviews.  Extramural areas of research interest are summarized in the current USAMRMC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and in Program Announcements (PA).  Program Announcements will result in full proposals, and either pre-proposals or Letters of Intent (LOI).  While peer review within the USAMRMC is not governed by statute or DoD, Army, or USAMRMC policy or regulation, the requirements for the USAMRMC peer review program parallels many of the requirements detailed in 42 CFR, Part 52h, Scientific Peer Review of Research Grant Applications and Research and Development Contract Projects.  In addition, this command is tasked with on-going active management of research.  Periodic scientific and programmatic peer review of on-going research (performance reviews) is also required. <br>  <br> This will be a non-personal services support contract which contains no services that are Inherently Governmental Functions as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 and 7.5.  The services required under this contract are subject to Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) IAW the FAR Subpart 9.5, as performance of these services will give the Contractor access to extensive data about contracts and assistance agreements of other contractors and research institutions that support the USAMRMC mission.  A draft OCI Mitigation plan will be included in the technical approach as part of the proposal, with the final plan due 10 days after award. <br>  <br> This contracting effort will provide an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)  type contract, with four option years. Task Orders will be firm fixed priced.  Functions to be performed under this IDIQ: <br>  <br> a.	Administrative management of Broad Agency Announcement and select Program Announcements. <br> b.	Administrative management of extramural Letters of Intent (LOI), pre, and full proposals for research and medical research related conferences. <br> c.	Scientific Peer Reviews of research proposals. <br> i.	Mail <br> ii.	Panel <br> iii.	Intramural <br> d.	Scientific Performance or Program Peer Review for on-going research. <br> e.	Other special scientific and/or programmatic reviews. <br> f.	Scientific Consulting Services. <br> g.	Electronic management of data and files. <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments and all questions and answers relating to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ or https://www.fedbizopps.gov. <br>    <br> The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about, February 1, 2013.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a contract or otherwise pay for the information solicited.
<p>The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential businesses having the capability to provide and commission a nominal 900 W at 20&#730; K helium gas refrigeration system to supplement the existing helium refrigeration system that supports tests in the space chambers at Arnold Engineering and Development Complex (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Air Force Space Systems Test Facility (SSTF) here at AEDC includes two test cells that are used to perform infrared sensor calibration. These two cells are high-vacuum, cryogenic-temperature chambers. They are cooled using a closed-loop gaseous helium (GHe) refrigeration system that provides GHe at temperatures below 20 Kelvin. The GHe refrigeration system is composed of multiple compressor skids feeding two liquid-nitrogen (LN2) pre-cooled refrigerators, with a total cooling capacity of 4 kW, utilizing piston expanders. The Air Force is contemplating in adding an additional GHe compressor skid and an additional refrigerator to the existing GHe refrigeration system, to provide additional cooling capacity, and to provide redundancy.</p>
<p>A new compressor and refrigerator must be compatible with the existing infrastructure and meet all requirements of the Salient Features listed below. The two units would be delivered to the Space Systems Test Facility (SSTF) and installed by SSTF personnel, with assistance and guidance from the vendor/manufacture.</p>
<p>Salient Features:</p>
<p>- System must be able to use Industrial/Technical Grade Helium (99.995% pure) as a working gas.</p>
<p>- Compressor inlet pressure/ refrigerator return pressure is 19 mmHg (gage pressure).</p>
<p>- Compressor inlet temperature / refrigerator return temperature is 275 K.</p>
<p>- Compressor skid discharge pressure / refrigerator inlet pressure is 250 psig.</p>
<p>- Compressor skid discharge temperature / refrigerator inlet temperature is 300 K.</p>
<p>- Compressor skid is cooled by industrial water at 75 F.</p>
<p>- Refrigerator is cooled by liquid Nitrogen at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>- Refrigerator minimum cooling capacity is 900 W at 20K load return temperature.</p>
<p>- Compressor skid capacity is matched to the refrigerator capacity.</p>
<p>All interested parties who believe that they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing the complete information describing their capability, qualifications, and answers to the survey questions below to provide the aforementioned support services.</p>
<p>- What style/type of expander does the refrigerator employ (piston, turbine, other?)</p>
<p>- What is the cleanliness/purity requirement for the system at the refrigerator inlet?</p>
<p>- What is the space envelope (x, y, z dimensions) which is occupied by the refrigerator, the expander?</p>
<p>- Will the new compressor skid work simultaneously in parallel with existing compressor skids employing Linde RS compressors?</p>
<p>- Does the supplier have the necessary facilities to operate the system while simulating a calibrated heat load to match the operating conditions and capacity for purposes of validation at a runoff?</p>
<p>- What is the length of uninterrupted operation the system can achieve before shut off for recommended maintenance?</p>
<p>- Does the supplier offer field support for commissioning the system?</p>
<p>- How many employees does the supplier maintain?</p>
<p>- Is the contractor certified as a small business with SBA? If so, what type?</p>
<p>- Where are the parts/components manufactured?</p>
<p>- What is the lead time for the equipment?</p>
<p>Please include your company name, point of contact, address, telephone number, Duns&amp; Bradstreet Unique Numbering System (DUNS) number, Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and your firms' small business status and category (i.e. Small Business, Woman Owned Small Business, HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), etc.).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, in Pascagoula, MS intends to award a purchase order to charter the research vessel Georgia Bulldog. The Harvesting Systems and Engineering Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Pascagoula Laboratory has been tasked with the development of turtle excluder device (TED) gear for the both the Southeastern penaeid shrimp fishery and the South Alantic flynet fishery. NMFS uses the small turtle test protocol (U.S. Federal Register, Vol. 55, No. 195) to certify candidate TEDs, but in addition to this test, it is beneficial to test TEDs to determine if there is a loss of the target catch, the bycatch exclusion rates, and to evaluate the TEDs for their exclusion rates of larger wild turtles. These tests serve to validate the small turtle tests and determine how effective the candidate TEDs are in real world conditions. Harvesting Systems and the University of Georgia Marine Extension Service (UGMAREX) research vessel, the Georgia Bulldog have developed an underwater camera system that will allow real time underwater observations of TEDs to monitor them for wild turtle escapement. Historically, the Cape Canaveral, FL ship channel has been an area with high sea turtle concentrations which allow these tests to be conducted. The research vessel R/V Georgia Bulldog is known to have required equipment and trained personnel to perform these tests. Three objectives will be accomplished with this charter (1) compare bycatch and target catch rates of candidate TEDs to a naked net (no TED installed), (2) determine exclusion rates of wild turtles via real-time video monitoring, (3) install satellite tags and collect data on any captured wild turtles.
<p>Salient characteristics about the Georgia Bulldog, are as follows:</p>
<p>1.) Vessel Configuration and Equipment</p>
<p>a.) This vessel is powered and rigged for the efficient operation of large fish trawls (a trawl reel and a stern ramp) and standard shrimp trawl gear (outriggers). This project requires that both gear types be evaluated on a day to day basis. In order to quickly and safely change between trawl types the vessel must be suitably rigged. The vessel crew has the ability to make gear changes quickly and efficiently, which will conserve project time and overall expense to the government.<br /><br />b.) The project requires that in-water measurements of the trawls be obtained using electronic net mensuration equipment. The R/V Georgia Bulldog has a SCANMAR netsonde system capable of measuring trawl height and spread in real time. This system will allow us to assess the effect of TED installation on trawl configuration. A net mensuration system is very costly and most commercial fishermen are not known by the government to have such a system.</p>
<p>c.) Underwater camera system. The R/V Georgia Bulldog also possesses an underwater camera system capable of mounting on the trawl and providing real time video to the vessel. This system will be used to observe the interaction of sea turtles with fly nets and shrimp nets. The camera system will also be used to count the frequency, and determine how quickly wild sea turtles are able to pass through the TED on a real time bases. This system consists of two underwater cameras and a hydrophone on each net. The cameras and hydrophone are connected via waterproof cabling to a hydraulic cable reel that deploys and retrieves the cable. Inside the cabin the vessel has four digital VCRs all equipped with a flat panel video monitor.</p>
<p>d.) Experience. The captain and crew have extensive local knowledge about where turtles are located in and around the Cape Canaveral ship channel and have worked in that area since the 1980s capturing sea turtles for numerous TED tests and turtle tagging expeditions. The captain must have knowledge about video cameras systems including how to repair systems if needed. <br /><br />2.) Vessel Crew</p>
<p>a.) Captain and crew are experienced in the deployment, retrieval and repair of fly net gear and shrimp trawling gear. Captain and crew should be familiar with the operation and maintenance of both gear types.</p>
<p>b.) Captain and crew knowledgeable in the use and repair of an electronic net mensuration system and underwater camera system.</p>
<p>3) Vessel documentation/certification.</p>
<p>4) Must pass a USCG, NOAA Office of Marine Operations safety inspection or other third party inspection equivalent to Subchapter U, 46 CFR 188 for life at sea, fire safety, and material condition. This inspection must also be conducted on vessels designated as "uninspected vessels" or "research vessels" by the USCG.</p>
<p>5)Vessel Requirements</p>
<p>- Engine power of 375 HP sufficient to tow 90-ft. headrope length fly net gear @ 3.0-3.5 knots.<br />- Hydraulic net reel. <br />- Dry work area for working on underwater camera system. <br />- Stern ramp for deployment of large fish trawls.<br />- Berthing space for 3 scientists.<br />- Meals supplied for 3 scientists (3 meals per day).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />6) Other equipment required</p>
<p>- Electronic net mensuration system. <br />- Trawl mounted underwater camera system with DV or DVCAM video recorders and monitors.</p>
<p><br />Market research for conventional shrimp trawlers conducted in 2010 and 2011 (associated with Deepwater Horizion and Expanded Stock Assessment sampling projects).</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a presolicitation announcement. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran owned, and Women owned Small Business firms. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the Government in making appropriate acquisition decisions.
<p>NOAA's Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) of the Office National Marine Sanctuaries has developed integrated ecosystem monitoring projects for sandy beaches, rocky shores and offshore areas of the Sanctuary. These monitoring projects collectively are called Sanctuary Ecosystem Assessment Surveys (SEAS). At least two of these projects include a volunteer-based, survey project called SEAS-Beach Watch and SEAS-Shoreline Marine Debris. The overall emphasis of the project is directed at the gathering of data, analysis and interpretation of the data for ecological assessment of natural resources, and making these data sets and databases available to sanctuary staff for interpretation and outreach products, relevance to management, other resource protection agencies, research institutions and the public.</p>
<p>Specifically, GFNMS has a requirement for the administration, data integration, and interpretation of four (SEAS) projects, SEAS-Beach Watch (SEAS-BW), SEAS-Applied California Current Ecosystem Assessment Surveys (SEAS-ACCESS) monitoring project, SEAS-Rocky Intertidal (SEAS-RI), and SEAS-Shoreline Marine Debris (SEAS-SMD). It also has a requirement for the supervision of volunteers (for SEAS-BW and SEAS SMD) and interns in support of these monitoring projects. The emphasis will be focused on data integration with on-site data and offsite environmental and biological monitoring data sets. Natural resource protection and emergency response are primary uses of SEAS data. Therefore, SEAS analyses and findings are intrinsically integrated into planning and preparation for emergency response, carrying-out response and damage assessment activities, identification of resources at risk, controlling or mitigating human-use pressures either through permitting, oversight of management actions, and/or evaluation of restoration and mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Data interpretation is also an emphasis in this requirement in order to provide interpreted data for education and outreach exhibits and programs, data base integration to merge data sets with outside monitoring projects that target birds, mammals, human activities that have impacts on sanctuary resources, mapping and geo-spatial analysis to view integrated data and human use activities, identification of natural resources at risk from anthropogenic pressures/impacts, and emerging issues.<br /><br />Responsibilities include: maintenance and upgrades to current data bases and data sets for four sanctuary projects: SEAS-BW, SEAS-ACCESS monitoring project, SEAS-RI, and SEAS-SMD; integration of data bases and data sets with other marine animal and habitat monitoring projects within and outside the sanctuary program; post interpreted findings of status, trends and overall health of seabirds, marine mammals, sea turtles, neritic and offshore habitats, and rocky intertidal and sandy shoreline habitats, including influences from anthropogenic pressures on natural resource abundance, distribution, mortality, and productivity, and biodiversity, and when applicable comparing impacts on biodiversity and across habitats from climate change and ocean acidification; integration of SEAS data sets; tracking and analyzing volunteer statistics; statistical and geo-spatial analyses of field sampling for birds, mammals, beach wrack, invertebrates, and human impacts; maintenance of a scientific data analysis work station at the GFNMS offices for visiting scientists.</p>
<p>Findings shall be posted on the sanctuary web site, GFNMS Sanctuary Information and Monitoring Network (SIMoN) web site in the form of annual reports, independent and issue related tables, charts, maps, Google Earth and Google Ocean accounts and images by beach, habitat and/or region, podcasts and YouTube videos and slideshows. Other responsibilities include: volunteer recruitment and training when funding as available, volunteer supervision and recognition; production and distribution of volunteer program materials such as brochures when funding is available; management of permit reporting requirements; management of volunteer paperwork and distribution of permits; management of data and samples collected; maintenance of SEAS-BW on-line and workstation data entry and query programs, and data management programs for all SEAS projects in Excel, Access, ArcView; maintenance of digital images cataloging and archives for all SEAS monitoring projects; emergency response and damage assessment programs as they relate to monitoring programs; integration of SEAS data sets with other long-term monitoring projects at GFNMS, including biological and physical parameters.</p>
<p>SEAS-Beach Watch is a volunteer-based shoreline-monitoring project targeting the status and trends of coastal birds and mammals and human use activities. The Beach Watch project has created a network of highly trained volunteers that are very knowledgeable about subtle changes along the Sanctuary's coastline. Beach Watch provides valuable data and findings on human impacts such as from oil pollution and disturbance, the natural variation of mortality events, and appropriate scaling and placement of restoration projects for birds and mammals. Approximately 80-100 volunteers and interns are used for this project.</p>
<p>SEAS-Applied California Current Ecosystem Surveys is a coastal and offshore monitoring project targeting the status and trends of coastal and offshore birds, mammals, sea turtles, human uses and impacts such as ship and boating interactions, marine trash, likelihood of impacts from water column pollution, and identifying and understanding the ecological linkages between foraging areas and breeding areas. This project provides valuable data and findings on regional distribution of birds, mammals, their prey, primary productivity, scaling and ecological linkages between human actions such as oil pollution and dispersants, and provides appropriate scaling and placement of restoration projects for birds and mammals. Approximately 0-5 volunteers and interns are used for this project.</p>
<p>SEAS-Rocky Intertidal is a rocky intertidal habitat-monitoring project targeting the status and trends of marine algae and invertebrates. It is important for sanctuary management to understand global climate change, such as impacts from ocean acidification (OA) and the rocky intertidal habitats is considered a "sentinel habitat" as an early indicator - early evidence of the strength and duration of impacts from OA will be seen in the rocky intertidal habitat. By understanding the influence of OA on the rocky intertidal habitat sanctuary management can better develop adaptive management actions that will incorporate impacts from climate change on the likelihood of successful restoration projects for other sanctuary resources such as seabirds and marine mammals. Approximately 0-5 volunteers and interns are used for this project.</p>
<p>SEAS-Shoreline Marine Debris is a volunteer-based shoreline-monitoring project targeting the status and trends of coastal debris and trash that wash-up on sanctuary beaches from offshore sources. The Shoreline Marine Debris project is part of a West Coast wide network of highly trained volunteers that monitor the deposition and retention of marine debris along the Sanctuary's coastline. Shoreline Marine Debris provides valuable data and findings on sources of marine debris.</p>
<p>Variable numbers of work hours per task should be anticipated to allow for part-time tasks for key personnel.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), Office of Enrollment and Discipline ("OED") is responsible for registering patent attorneys and agents to practice in patent cases before the USPTO. A candidate seeking registration to practice in patent cases before the USPTO must, <em>inter alia, </em>demonstrate possession of the legal, scientific, and technical qualifications necessary to enable him or her to render patent applicants valuable service. To measure legal qualifications of registration candidates, OED tests applicants to ascertain if they have the necessary knowledge of patent law, practice and procedure to provide valuable assistance to patent applicants. Approximately three thousand six hundred (3,600) examinations were administered in fiscal year 2008; approximately three thousand four hundred (3,400) examinations were administered in fiscal year 2009; approximately three thousand one hundred (3,100) examinations were administered in fiscal year 2010; approximately two thousand seven hundred (2,700) examinations were administered in fiscal year 2011, and approximately three thousand four hundred (3,400) examinations were administered in fiscal year 2012. These tests were conducted by a single contractor at sites located throughout the nation. Candidates who fail the examination may schedule a review session to review the questions answered incorrectly. These review sessions currently take place at the Alexandria, Virginia, headquarters of the USPTO. Approximately one hundred ten (110) review sessions were held during fiscal year 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The USPTO has a requirement for a Computer Test Administrator ("CTA") firm capable of administering computer-based patent registration examinations in the United States, District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico providing review sessions by applicants who failed those examinations. The CTA firm must possess and operate a computer-based examination system with an examination registration administration function that will accommodate current and future multiple choice examinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The computer-based examination system must also have a review session administration function that will accommodate review sessions for candidates who have failed the registration examination.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Additional information concerning the registration examination is available on the USPTO Internet web site (http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/index.jsp) and in the General Requirements Bulletin for Admission to the Examination for Registration to Practice in Patent Cases before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/exam/grbpage.jsp"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/exam/grbpage.jsp</span></a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The USPTO desires to administer the registration examination by computer in one or more locations in each state of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia every day except federal holidays. The registration examination may not be administered outside the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Services are required at no cost to the Government. The CTA collects and retains a CTA examination administration (fixed price) fee directly from candidates before the examination is administered. The <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">CTA<em> </em></span>examination administration fee includes two components. The first portion of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">CTA </span>examination administration fee is intended to cover all costs and reasonable profit to the CTA for operating the testing centers and supporting systems for administration of the examination; the second portion is intended to cover all costs and a reasonable profit to the CTA for consultation services in developing sound, legally defensible computer-based examinations and examination forms. At the completion of the examination, the CTA will provide a written test report to the registration candidate.</span></p>

Responses to this sources sought/RFI notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement.  This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation.  All interested sources must respond to any future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> The National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) is the Defense Department's primary producer of ground forces intelligence.  NGIC produces scientific and technical intelligence and military capabilities analysis on foreign ground forces required by warfighting commanders, the force modernization and research and development communities, Defense Department, and national policymakers.  <br>  <br> NGIC is conducting market research for a potential requirement.  NGIC is performing market research for intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm program.  The Quiet Storm program is an interagency Counter-Improved Explosive Device (C-IED) targeting and analysis effort.  The program responds to immediate intelligence support tasks from task forces in the Iraq and Afghanistan warfighting theaters aimed at stopping daily loss of life of US soldiers to IEDs on the battlefield. <br>  <br> The purpose of this notice enables NGIC to obtain and acquire market information, determine the availability and capability of sources, obtain information on how prospective firms would provide intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm program, and determine approximate costs and implementation timelines. <br>  <br> The primary focus for this project is to provide intelligence and operational support for the Quiet Storm program.  Support includes intelligence analysis that investigates, analyzes, and targets the global movement of dual-use components and technology by illicit procurement networks worldwide.  The Quiet Storm program identifies intelligence gaps in analytic knowledge and provides measures to rectify inadequacies.  Analysts identify emerging threats and historical trends, fusing multiple sources/forms of intelligence data together for network technical and targeting analysis.  Analysts present briefings on a wide variety of intelligence products to general officers and senior government officials and work closely with a multitude of CONUS and OCONUS-based intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies operating within various regions of the world.  These services will be performed onsite at the NGIC in Charlottesville, VA. <br>  <br> Duties include: Program Manager, Threat Financial Analyst, Network Analyst, TECHINT SME, Senior Principle Analyst, Data Analyst, SIGINT Metadata Analyst, Senior Principle Analyst, Senior Principle Analyst (OCONUS), HUMINT Targeting Officer (OCONUS), and Optional Surge Labor (HUMINT Targeting Officers, Open Source Analyst, Senior Principle Technician/LNO). <br>  <br> Performance requires a TOP SECRET contractor facility clearance.  Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be U.S. Citizens, have a final TOP SECRET clearance with a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), and shall be eligible for indoctrination to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level.  Some positions may require a Polygraph examination if additional accesses are required.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary security clearances for contractor personnel.  This TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance requirement may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. <br>  <br> A cost-reimbursable type contract is anticipated with up to four (4) option-year periods, (i.e., base year plus four (4) option years). <br>  <br> Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ( quote mark Limitations on Subcontracting quote mark ).  13 C.F.R. 125.6 contains the prime contractor performance requirements under these limitations on subcontracting rule.  Failure to definitively address each of these factors may result in a finding that the respondent lacks the capability to perform the work. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Prospective sources possessing the capability, experience, and security clearance qualifications are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought for the NGIC Quiet Storm program.

Every year, VA researchers develop dozens of new technologies of great benefit to veterans and the public.  VA's Technology Transfer Program (TTP) translates these developments into practical application.  TTP educates VA employees regarding their obligation to disclose inventions and their rights as federal employees.  TTP evaluates these inventions, patents when appropriate, and seeks commercial partners to develop them further.  

TTP receives approximately 200 disclosures per year.  Because of VA's historic close working relationship with affiliated academic medical centers, most of VA's inventions are jointly owned with our affiliates, who often take the lead in patenting and commercialization.  This is facilitated by Cooperative Technology Administration Agreements with 60 of VA's affiliated academic medical centers.  TTP directly manages about 20% of the disclosed inventions.  The remainder are managed by our affiliates.  TTP and its affiliates files approximately 40 patent applications each year, and receive approximately 10 issued patents.  To date, VA or its affiliates have entered into over 200 licenses with companies to further develop VA owned inventions. 

In addition to managing inventions made by VA employees, TTP facilitates the negotiation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), agreements that allow industry and VA to work together for the benefit of industry and veterans.  TTP, together with VA's Office of General Counsel, Veterans Health Administration and VA's Veterans Research and Educational Foundations have developed a series of model agreements that serve as templates for new agreements.  In addition, VA has negotiated master agreements with 14 leading pharmaceutical companies.  Master agreements are company specific agreements where both VA and the company formally agree to use the master agreement without further modification for all future collaborations.  

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

Contractor will have a minimum of five years experience in IP and patent law, filing and prosecuting patents as required by U.S. Federal Laws and Regulations. Experience with filing and prosecuting patents in an academic setting is an additional benefit for this requirement.

<a href="mailto:matthew.c.gianni.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army intends to procure quantity (1 each) Monitor and Control (M&C) subsystem for the Regional Hub Node (RHN) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment at Landstuhl, Germany, quantity (1 each) M&C Prescribed Load List (PLL) Spare Kit at Landstuhl, and New Equipment Training (NET) at Landstuhl.  The Government requires replacement of the current M&C subsystem that is part of the GD antenna system part number 9mKXK-12941 that is part of the Regional Hub Node (RHN) Satellite Communication equipment used at Landstuhl.    This effort includes on-site installation.  The Period of Performance for this effort is 150 days After Contract Award.  The resulting contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract type.  The proposed source is General Dynamics Satcom Technologies, Inc., 4825 River Green Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30096.  General Dynamics is the only source with the knowledge of the technical design requirements of its 9mKXK-12941 antenna system. The Government does not possess drawings/schematics that detail vital design information that would enable any other source to replace the Monitor &Control (M&C) Subsystem, which is nearing obsolescence. The integration of hardware and software changes that are necessary to replace the M&C Subsystem are tightly coupled and therefore only a source with extensive knowledge of this antenna system can accomplish the required efforts without extensive delays.  Any other source would need to reverse engineer GD's antenna system to understand its design before it could implement the required M&C replacement and this would result in delays of at least 8 months. Additionally, to complete the proposed effort it will be necessary to replace the High Power Amplifier Controller in the Antenna Hub.  This will require new switching equipment and a new waveguide to replace the existing waveguide runs.  Detailed knowledge of the Antenna Hub wiring is required to perform this modification; and only GD possesses that knowledge.

<DESC><br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking public comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for the procurement of services for a program titled "Office of Treaty Compliance Analytical and Technical Support".
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Brief Introduction/Summary: </span></strong></p>
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides interagency coordination, negotiation support, and technical and analytical support for treaty management activities to the Office of Treaty Compliance (TC) of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense. The role of arms control treaties/agreements in U.S. national security continues to evolve in parallel with the advancement of increasingly sophisticated offensive and defensive weapon components and weapon systems. In this evolving environment, the DoD must remain fully compliant with the legal obligations imposed by arms control treaties to which the U.S. is a party. <br /><br />The U.S.'s treaty compliance issues are becoming more difficult and more complex, thus requiring Increasingly sophisticated analyses to identify potential treaty compliance problems and ensure that needed DoD programs are executed in a manner compliant with all relevant treaties. In addition, new agreements requiring multilateral negotiations are becoming more prevalent. The geopolitical trend toward multi-lateralism, with many world players having the capacity to acquire modern equipment and weapons of mass destruction, is heightening concerns regarding proliferation. These changes are occurring in the midst of an information revolution, which has the effect of telescoping decision times such that the DoD must now frequently research, analyze and provide in days recommendations that previously might have been done in weeks or even months. <br /><em><br />(end Introduction/Summary)<br /></em><br />Attached for review and comments is a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) for the "Office of Treaty Compliance Analytical and Technical Support". <br /><br />DTRA is seeking feedback from interested firms on any ambiguities, inconsistencies, and unduly restrictive requirements listed in the SOW. Please provide feedback on to DTRA, Attn: Tabitha.Everly@dtra.mil by 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on January 31, 2013. <br /><br />Please note: Only feedback on the SOW will be accepted. DTRA will not accept Technical Capabilities White Papers or offerors.</p>

<SUBJECT>Relocation of two environmental test facilities

<RESPDATE>013013
<CONTACT>Divya Soni, Phone 3019756394, Email divya.soni@nist.gov
<DESC><strong><em>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source</em></strong>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Engineering Laboratory, Energy and Environment Division, intends to negotiate with Tescor, Inc.; Warminster, PA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to obtain services to relocate two environmental test facilities as described below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Background: </em></strong></p>
<p>The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (PL 94-163) (EPCA), as amended, requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to prescribe testing and rating procedures, and minimum energy efficiency standards for various residential appliances and commercial equipment. In accordance with the requirements of EPCA, the Building Technology Program (BTP) of the Department of Energy has long relied on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to assist it in the development of testing and rating procedures for air conditioners, heat pumps and refrigerators.</p>
<p>To improve NIST's capabilities in providing support of the DOE standards program, DOE made a decision to expand NIST experimental facilities used for testing air conditioners, heat pumps, and refrigerators by equipping NIST with two test facilities (two sets of environmental chambers): (1) Psychrometric Testing Facility and (2) Balanced Ambient Calorimeter Facility. Originally, these test facilities were purchased by DOE for the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown, WV. They are currently located at NETL, and need to be disassembled, relocated, assembled and commissioned at NIST.</p>
<p>The environmental test facilities to be installed at NIST are a complex arrangement of structural components, mechanical systems, and controls that must function safely, reliably, and properly to produce repeatable results according to established heat pump and air conditioner standard test procedures. Each component of these chambers must function properly under varied thermal load conditions for decades to come. Expert disassembly and installation/commissioning of the chambers, and warranty on the installed chambers are essential.</p>
<p>Because of chambers' large size, they are delivered to a purchaser in parts, and are assembled and commissioned at the purchaser's site. These chambers are not designed and assembled having possible relocations in mind; their disassembling invariable leads to breakage of some of their components, which have to be replaced by new ones. Hence, the disassembly effort requires detailed knowledge of equipment to avoid breakage as much as possible, and to be able to positively identify damaged parts and obtain new replacements.</p>
<p>Considering the complexity of the chambers, the installations instructions are rather involved and include chambers' placement, tight tolerances for the floor flatness, utilities, condensate drainage, etc. The NIST site preparation must precede the installation effort. The chamber installation must be followed by rigorous re-commissioning.</p>
<p><br />Extensive market research shows that the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), TESCOR, is the only source that can perform the required work, and provide a one-year warranty for the environmental chambers. Tescor is the sole provider of warranty for these specialty test facilities.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334516. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price contract to Tescor for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the services necessary may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before January 30, 2013 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Future Amphibious Ship Cost Reduction Concepts - Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>N0002413SN05A
<ARCHDATE>03162013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Navy is interested in concepts for improving future amphibious ship affordability while still retaining warship capabilities.  One approach towards this goal might be to use commercial design and build practice for as much of the ship as possible, and apply military standards only where necessary to achieve specific performance requirements.  The Navy would like Industry perspectives on potential benefits and challenges to implementing such a concept.  Specifically, the Navy requests information on:
	The feasibility and cost of building a Navy ship to commercial standards (as opposed to military standards), classed by ABS to Steel Vessel Rules (www.eagle.org), with the following capacities:
o	20,000 ft2 (1,860 m2) vehicle stowage space, with access to both well and weather decks, and with at least 13.5 ft (4.1 m) clear overhead
o	Well deck capable of embarking either two Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) or one Landing Craft Utility (LCU)
o	Troop berthing for 400
o	20,000 ft3 (570m3) magazine capable of stowing all types of USMC ammunition
o	NAVAIR certified flight deck with two land/launch spots for MH-53E or MV-22 aircraft
	The feasibility and cost of imposing the following additional design requirements on the above concept:
o	US Navy crew (approximately 350), with Navy standard damage control lockers & equipment
o	US Navy combatant damaged stability standards
o	Longitudinal bending moment dictated by Navy rather than being derived from seaway loads or ABS rules
o	Grade A shock qualified emergency take-home auxiliary propulsion system
o	Grade A shock qualified command and control spaces for government furnished electronic systems
o	Segregated Grade A shock qualified Navy standard electrical, cooling water, and other distributive systems to service take-home auxiliary propulsion and other vital systems.
  For the purpose of this RFI, assume that half of distributive system loads are to vital systems.
o	US Navy firefighting systems
	The practicality of implementing a mixed commercial and military standards ship by designating certain compartments as reserved for military standard equipment, with the shipbuilder free to outfit all other compartments in the most cost effective manner that satisfies ABS Steel Vessel Rules.
	Labor and material breakdowns for any ship costs estimates.
	Explanations for how specific potential future amphibious ship requirements would affect costs.
	Contractual, specification, or other issues that might impact a mixed commercial and military standards ship program.
	Other ideas or suggestions for future amphibious ship affordability such as acquisition strategies, innovative total ship solutions, technology advancements, or design and construction concepts/methodologies.
It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.
 Nevertheless, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum.

Responses must be unclassified and are requested within 60 days, preferably in plain text, Microsoft Office, or Adobe PDF electronic formats.  Responses should be sent by electronic mail to the NAVSEA point of contact, Mr. Steven Wynn (steven.wynn@navy.mil), (202) 781-3459.

This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded based on this RFI. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any subsequent information requests that pertain to this RFI.
 However, responses may be used in the determination of the appropriate acquisition.

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to amend its Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-12-G-WS55 with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, ES Defensive Systems Division, 1745A West Nursery Road, Linthicum Heights, Md.
 21090.  The BOA covers a five-year period for spares, repairs, modifications, upgrades, engineering support, technical support, logistical support, assemblies subassemblies, ancillary equipment, system and subsystem integration of the AN/ALQ-218.  The AN/ALQ-218 System covered includes the system as a whole, the individual Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), the Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs), support equipment, test equipment and applicable system firmware.  Efforts will include increasing capacity for Repair/Rework/and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification and Logistics Support Services as required.
  The amendment will increase contract ceiling to cover NAVAIR required SRA support.   Additional detailed guidance will be provided as implemented by specific job orders placed under the BOA.
This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C, 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that the U.S. Government has invested in excess of $200 million into the development, test and integration of the AN/ALQ 218 into the EA-18G platform and the majority of this cost and time would have to be duplicated since another vendor would have to repeat all laboratory, ground and flight testing through full-up EA-18G weapons systems performance flight testing to qualify substitute items.
No solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps located at http://www.fbo.gov  or NECO located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.
  However, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  The POC is Mr. Scott Barnes, Code CXNN WB at telephone (812) 854-5773 or email: scott.j.barnes@navy.mil.  Reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<a href="mailto:KRISTINE.HOSTETLER@VA.GOV">NOTICE OF INTENT</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Acquisition Center (NAC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract for a Semi-Automatic Bottle Opening System to R/X Automation Solutions Inc., P.O. Box 671, Longmont, CO 80501 under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The purpose of this contract is to provide and install a semi-automatic bottle opening system at two Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) facilities. The contract performance period is approximately 18 weeks after award. The NAICS code is 333993 Packaging Machinery Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Initial contract award is expected to be on or before 28 February 2013.  The VA has determined R/XAS is the only responsible source because they are the original designer and only supplier of a highly specialized commercial off-the-shelf prescription drug bulk-up system which processes the contents of fully-closed bottles at high speed, reducing staff and increasing production. This procurement is based on the determination that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals. 
 
This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date. Written responses shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  Written responses may be submitted electronically no later than 11:00 a.m. EST on 23 January 2013 to Kristine Hostetler at Kristine.Hostetler@va.gov.

The evaluation will stop at the point when the government determines a quoter to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price, because that quote will represent the best value.

Research Opportunity Description &not;<br />The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) permanently established the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research under the direction of an Associate Director, within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. One purpose of this office is to enhance the development of new technology and technological applications, and to expedite the commercial availability and implementation of such technology in mining environments. The MINER Act grants the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research the authority to (1) award competitive contracts and grants to institutions and private entities to encourage the development and manufacture of mine safety equipment and (2) award contracts to education institutions or private laboratories for the performance of product testing or related work with respect to new mine technology or equipment. This announcement is an opportunity for the award of contracts for enhancing safety in mines.<br />The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, NIOSH, is soliciting proposals to conduct research, exploratory development, testing, or evaluations of new technologies to improve mine safety, or to adapt technologies from other industries for application in mining environments that could result in improved safety for mineworkers. Proposals to facilitate or expedite commercialization of demonstrated mine safety technologies are also invited.<br />The Sago Mine explosion underscored the gaps in safety technologies for underground coal mines, and the need to fill those gaps was a significant consideration in the MINER Act of 2006. Fatality and injury data continue to highlight the need for solutions in underground coal mining, and accordingly this has been a priority for NIOSH OMSHR, which has been emphasized in this broad agency announcement. Although the desire for technology solutions in underground coal continues to be a priority again this year, proposals to utilize technology to improve safety in surface mines are encouraged as are proposals targeting problems in non-coal mines.<br />NIOSH considers the following five topics, which are listed in no special order to be areas of elevated interest; but as described in this solicitation, other topics are also appropriate for consideration. <br />1. Technology for Detection of Hazardous Conditions: The mining environment must be properly maintained to provide safe working conditions. Monitoring control interventions, such as ventilation, and sensing unanticipated hazardous conditions, such as methane gas liberation, are critical to ensuring a safe working environment. Recently, regional or mine-wide monitoring of conditions pre- and post-accident has been enhanced through the data transmission capability provided by the communication and tracking infrastructure now mandated for mine use. While these enabling technologies are likely to spur the application of enhanced mine-wide monitoring systems, leveraging this technology for assessment of remote areas of the mine are of particular interest. The use of a battery-powered, intrinsically safe, wireless monitoring system would provide the mine operator with the capability to continuously monitor gas in a near real time basis. This capability would be improved through the development of electrically-passive detection and monitoring systems that overcome permissibility and power limitations. Such developments also need to enhance system survivability to ensure operation following a mine emergency. Another area of interest is the development of fast acting atmospheric (methane) detectors for inclusion on mobile equipment. Current technologies are limited in response time that could miners at risk to rapidly changing conditions.<br />NIOSH is seeking innovative solutions for improving ventilation and gas monitoring in underground mines through the use of advanced mine wide monitoring systems.<br />2. Battery Technology: Batteries are a common source of power in underground coal mining. Applications range from small battery units used to power mine communication and tracking devices to large batteries designed to power large-scale mining equipment. When the mine conditions are compromised, it may become necessary to de-energize the battery to prevent it from serving as a potential ignition source.<br />NIOSH is seeking to identify practical concepts and determine their feasibility in de-energizing or otherwise rendering batteries safe following a catastrophic mining event.<br />3. Technology to Reduce Float Dust: Underground coal mining produces finely divided coal dust, generally referred to as float coal dust, which deposits throughout the mine and serves as a source of combustible material for coal dust explosions. Although limestone powder, known as rock dust can be spread over coal dust to act an inerting agent, maintaining coverage is difficult as the mining operation continues to produce dust and even a thin layer of additional coal dust deposited on a previously rock dusted area can restore the explosive condition. A more proactive approach is to reduce the generation of coal dust and/or suppress its release and dispersion from the production area. Controlling the generation of the dust may be done through improved extraction technologies to mitigate the formation of dust including feasibility of modern water jet cutting or modified mechanical cutting technologies. Suppression of float coal dust may be enhanced by improved water sprays, foaming agents, or novel water curtain technologies that physically remove coal dust from the ventilating air stream. Sensing technologies to determine dispersion of float coal dust and adequacies of rock dust over large areas are also being sought to automate rock dusting application equipment.<br />NIOSH is seeking to provide technologies that will detect, prevent, or mitigate float coal dust generation and dispersion in underground coal mines.<br />4. Through-the-Earth Communication: There have been significant developments in providing through-the-earth voice communication for underground coal mines to facilitate escape and rescue during a mine emergency. Current technologies include magnetic, electric-field, and acoustic systems. Each of these systems has demonstrated some level of through-the-earth communication capability, specifically voice communication distances of up to 1,000 ft and text communication up to 2,000 ft. However, the range varies greatly with technology and mining conditions and is impacted by both mine geology and geometry and environmental factors such as extraneous noise that interfere with signal transmission and capture.<br />NIOSH is interested in techniques to evaluate the efficacy and extend the range and coverage of current technologies, including proposals that include cooperative test agreements between the manufacturer and the mining company to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of through-the-earth technologies.<br />5. Rapid Drilling for Mine Rescue: Rescue of trapped miners is always a priority following a mine disaster. Rescuing trapped requires locating the miners and quickly drilling an access hole from the surface of sufficient diameter to lower a rescue capsule into the mine area where the miners are located. Although there have been successful rescue efforts, these activities remain challenging. In particular, the drilling operation is hampered by the need to drill through voids created by previous mining or geologic zones of weakness. The need for a large diameter hole emphasizes the need for a near straight pilot hole, which delivery of a straight hole can also be complicated by geology and void areas. At times due to terrain or other property constraints, there may also be a need for directional drilling capability to facilitate drilling an access hole within minimum time.<br />NIOSH is seeking to enhance the capability to quickly and accurately drill large-diameter rescue holes to reach trapped miners.<br />The primary goal of the MINER Act technology mandate is to improve/increase the use of technology in mines to improve mineworker safety and health, and the intent of this broad agency announcement is to support enabling activities such as technology identification, validation, demonstration, adaptation, and/or commercialization. Under this specific solicitation, proposals to conduct theoretical or basic research will not be considered. The following examples are presented to further illustrate appropriate submissions under this solicitation beyond the more general guidance listed previously.<br />1. A safety technology that is currently in a prototype stage, which will require funding for final development and adaptation to the underground coal mining environment. This could include modification of prototypes to account for operation in the challenging underground coal environment, modification to meet permissibility requirements, and/or demonstration of the technology at actual mine sites.</p>
<p>2. A safety technology that is currently being used in another industry and requires modification to be adapted to underground coal mines. This could include system redesign, modification to meet permissibility requirements, in-mine testing to establish the efficacy of the technology, and/or demonstration of the technology at mine sites.<br />3. Analysis of candidate technologies to establish their potential to improve safety, and/or analyses of barriers to technology application or means of overcoming such barriers.<br />H. Instrument Type(s) and Period of Performance - It is anticipated that awards will take the form of contracts. Work that will be completed in 24 months or less is desired under this solicitation, but is not a requirement; projects requiring up to 48 months will be considered.<br />1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) Request for Proposal (RFP) announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS Code is 325120 with a size standard of 1000 employees. DMEA anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The RFP reference number is H94003-13-R-0001</span>. DPAS rating is DO-C9E. Offerors Proposals shall be valid for a minimum of 60 days. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offerors Quotes are due to the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) contracting office by 3:00pm (PST) on February 19, 2013 and will be electronically sent by email to Ed Kurjanowicz at edward.kurjanowicz@dmea.osd.mil.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A site visit will be held at DMEA on January 31, 2013 at 10:00am (PST).</span> Attendees must send an email to edward.kurjanowicz@dmea.osd.mil 24 hours prior to site visit providing name, name of firm, job title, phone number, citizenship status and address.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Request for Proposal(RFP) Objective</span>: The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) at McClellan, California operates microelectronics wafer fabrication clean rooms and other laboratory processes that require semiconductor grade, high purity nitrogen (N2) gas at 105 psi, as well as liquid N2 for laboratory use. The objective of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to purchase continuous uninterrupted N2, the needed bulk liquid N2 delivery, on-site liquid N2 storage, on-site N2 gas production system, and on-going system support as needed to meet DMEA current operational needs and anticipated future growth. Due to DMEA's critical need for continuous, uninterrupted N2 supply (both liquid and gas) the contractor shall meet the following minimum qualifications: own and operate their liquid N2 production and storage facility in the local McClellan, California region; own/lease and operate the liquid N2 delivery trucks; demonstrated ability for at least the last 5 years to deliver high purity bulk liquid N2 to semiconductor fabrication facilities; and demonstrated ability for at least the last five (5) years to design, provide and operate N2 liquid to gas delivery systems for semiconductor fabrication customers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DMEA Facility Usage Rates</span>: usage rates range from approximately 71,000 gallons (6.6 million standard cubic feet (FTS)) of liquid N2 per month to 78,000 gallons (7.3 million FTS) of N2 per month with a peak N2 gas demand of approximately 132 gallons/hour (12,290 FTS/hour). DMEA's usage rate may vary based on operational demands.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview of Requirements</span>: the contractor shall design, provide and install a N2 system consisting of a liquid N2 storage tank, dual, triple or quad switchable heat exchangers (vaporizers) to covert the liquid N2 to gaseous N2, piping, gauges, regulators, valves, a filling station for DMEA's portable liquid N2 "Dewar" tank, remote monitoring equipment and an output header for DMEA's connection to the building piping. The contractor shall provide any needed foundation, support structure, piping, fencing and utilities to support a new system installation. The contractor shall provide on-going maintenance support of the N2 system, quality control and provide liquid N2 product resupply based on DMEA operational demands. To maintain gas quality, the N2 gas shall be contained in electro-polished 316L stainless steel piping, associated fittings, and equipment. The contractor shall, after contract award, visit DMEA prior to developing their final design to identify existing field conditions, identify any constraints for both the equipment and delivery trucks and verify operational requirements. DMEA has reserved an area north of the existing N2 system for installation of a new system as necessary. There is also some space available to the south if needed to add vaporizers to the system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Engineering Drawings of New System/or System Modifications</span>: within 30 days after contract award, the contractor shall provide N2 system engineering drawings showing the system and the required site requirements. The site requirement drawings shall include the concrete slab details, fencing and utilities. The site requirement drawings shall include required rebar, electrical requirements, and any other required utilities and estimate of the soils to be removed. (Note: DMEA will use this information to obtain an Encroachment Permit for the contractor to proceed with the necessary site work.) All site work shall be the responsibility of the contractor. The pad attachments points for the tank and other major equipment tie down points shall be engineered to meet California Building Code seismic load requirements. The contractor shall have the drawings reviewed and stamped by a California Licensed Professional Engineer to verify the system is adequate for the intended purpose and installation in the Sacramento seismic area in accordance with California Building Code. Upon DMEA approval of such contractor provided engineering drawings and within 90 days after contract award, the contractor shall have installed a fully functional and filled liquid N2 storage system and gaseous N2 delivery system.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

The contractor must state, as an exception, any types of highway licensable vehicles for which it does not provide residual forecasts.</p>
<p>Residual File Format Specifications and Transfer Process:</p>
<p>1. Each Morning (following the run of a business day's nightly cycle) GSA Fleet will drop off an initiation file in the vendor's mailbox via FTP. The file contains the VINs, Location, Options and other data portrayed as follows:</p>
<p>Sample data:</p>
<p>1GNFK03029R274607,TX, 27108.40,CNS;D3;RDI;SL;<br />1GNFK030X9R271549,TX, 27108.40,CNS;D3;RDI;SL;<br />5FCLS36B5A1000952,CA, 11745.29,CNS; <br />5FCLS36B7A1000953,CA, 11745.29,CNS; <br />5FCLS46B1A1000341,CA, 13075.46,CNS;</p>
<p>Please note that the data elements: VIN, State, Capital value, must be comma delimited. However, the option codes must be delimited by a ; character.</p>
<p>2. The hour following the drop off of the initiation file, our program looks in the vendor's mailbox for their response file. If the file is not available, the program will keep checking for a response file each subsequent hour. The response file must contain all the data of the initiation file with the vendor's targeted residuals appended to each record. Please refer to the following sample as a reference.</p>
<p>Sample data from vendor:</p>
<p>1GNFK03029R274607,TX, 27108.40,CNS;D3;RDI;SL;,24675,21675,18025,14025,10250,8450 1GNFK030X9R271549,TX, 27108.40,CNS;D3;RDI;SL;,24675,21675,18025,14025,10250,8450 5FCLS36B5A1000952,CA, 11745.29,CNS;,0,0,0,0,0,0 <br />5FCLS36B7A1000953,CA, 11745.29,CNS;,0,0,0,0,0,0 <br />5FCLS46B1A1000341,CA, 13075.46,CNS;,0,0,0,0,0,0</p>
<p>The record layout of the return file from the vendor is similar to the one GSA Fleet sends with 6 additional residual values, also delimited by commas.</p>
<p>The vendor shall adhere to these specific file format standards. Any variance from the agreed upon format will result in a breakdown of the data transfer and subsequent misstatement of depreciation expenses on all impacted vehicles.

Applicant MUST have completed an Emergency Medicine residency and preferably be Board Certified in Emergency Medicine.</p>
<p>Contractors are sought to help fill the difficult gaps in the ER schedule. They are often put on the schedule for nights, weekends, holidays, and are often grouped into several shifts when needed during a short period of time. Sometimes, they are not scheduled for an extended period of time to ensure the other permanent doctors get enough shifts for their any -80- requirements. Sometimes, there is a need of several shifts to be filled within a short period of time. Even though not convenient, they frequently have to cover single shifts when needed. This can result in significant expense for those traveling a long distance, but cannot always be avoided. We aim to group shifts into at least two days in a row, but often that cannot be arranged. Contractors could have single shifts far apart from any other shift.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) anticipates awarding multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) on a sole source basis in support of the Integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Program/Project, which is a tri-service (Army, Navy and Air Force) effort, for development and integration of the enhanced Telemetry Network System (TmNS) required for providing real-time test information between in-flight aircraft and ground engineering personnel.
<p>It is the intent of the Government to issue one of the aforementioned BOAs to Quasonix on a sole source basis to procure advanced TmNS components design and development. The requirement also entails procuring limited production quantities of the advanced design, testing and integration, and required support services. The overall goal is to further define iNET standards that are currently in draft stage. The BOA will be in effect for five (5) years and it will include provisions to issue delivery orders with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs. It is anticipated that orders placed under the BOA covering the first two years will entail conducting advanced component design, development and testing (CPFF). The remaining three (3) years will entail procuring production quantities (FFP) and the maintenance and integration support services (CPFF).</p>
<p>Quasonix has been involved in iNET project since 2005 to either test new ideas or to refine previously adopted portions of the draft iNETstandards. The effort will require Quasonix to continue with their on-going efforts to modify/advance their current designs in place for the components. The advanced prototypes will be implemented within fully operational devices in the actual environment that they are ultimately to be used. Once built, the advanced prototypes must be verified for their complete compliance with the draft iNET standards, which also requires validating that the standards are sufficiently detailed to achieve the desired interoperability. Quasonix is the only firm with the knowledge, expertise, and proprietary technical data required to perform this design and development effort to further advance their existing configuration of the components needed. The Government does not possess the required technical data to compete this procurement.</p>

<DESC>Amendment W91ZLK-13-T-0048 0001 is issued to provide answers to questions.  This Amendment revises the specifications, to be in accordance with Attachment 2 (attached).  Closing date of the solicitation remains at January 25, 2013, 10:00 A.M. eastern standard time. Please SUBMIT YOUR QUOTATIONS to Ms. Sowa at the Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground - Tennant Division, 6001 Combat Drive, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005.  This is a new address and the solicitation is amended to read this address.  Quotations may be submitted via email to: susan.l.sowa.civ@mail.mil. Quotations must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date.  For questions concerning this Request for Quotations contact Susan Sowa Contracting Officer @ email susan.l.sowa.civ@mail.mil. Additional questions must be received no later than January 22, 2013, eastern standard time. No telephone inquires.  <br>  <br> Question 1: Should this be an American made product or can products from Europe, Asia or China be acceptable?  Answer 1:  Unit shall be BAA or TAA compliant.  <br>  <br> Question 2:  Reference specification C file size needs to be letter (legal size is not required).   Question: Are the files being stored top tab for drawer filing or end tab for shelf filing? Answer: The existing files are hanging, end tab is acceptable, propose both end tab and hanging.  Question:  Are they hanging folders?  Answer: Yes see above.  Question: What type of carrier's is required? Answer:  Please clarify.  Question:  Are the files to be stored laterally on a shelf or are they to be stored in file drawers? Answer:  Propose both.  Question:  If in drawers are they to be stored in hanging folders or standard top tab folders?  Answer:  Propose both.  Question:  If in drawers do you want individual pull out drawers (trays) or full suspension pull out drawers?  Answer: Either is acceptable as long as security feature is in place. If it meets the security feature propose both.  <br>  <br> Question 3:  Reference specification e.  With a vertical carousel design it is not possible for the unit to self balance.  The unit balance depends upon product placement by the users.  The Vertical Carousel's have a maximum imbalance of 660 lbs.  An imbalance indicator should be part of the unit design so as to alert the end user of an imbalance situation.  Is it acceptable for the vertical carousels to have a maximum imbalance of 660 pounds and an imbalance indicator to alert the end user of an imbalance situation?  Answer:  An imbalance indicator is acceptable in lieu of the self balancing design. <br>  <br> Question 4:  Reference specification f.  With a vertical carousel design each shelf is physically secured in place to rotate around the tracks. The shelves are of a fixed height, this specification pertains more towards vertical lifts or shuttle type equipment with variable height shelves and is not applicable to a carousel design.  Can this spec be removed?  Answer:  Delete this requirement f. <br>  <br>  <br> Question 5:  Reference specification h.  An interior task light is not possible with a carousel design this specification pertains more towards vertical lifts or shuttle.  Is an exterior overhead light acceptable that goes on automatically when the unit power up acceptable?  Answer: The unit shall have automatic task lighting . <br>  <br>  <br> Question 6:  Under Specification e,  Model shall have self balancing design such that unit will not jam, tilt, or skew, or otherwise become inoperable due to heavy shelves, empty shelves or uneven loading.  The Lektriever/vertical carousal type systems have a feature that tells you which shelves/carriers are causing an imbalance problem. However, they don't automatically readjust the load/media; the user has to redistribute the media/load within the unit themselves.  Answer:  See Question and Answer 3 - An imbalance indicator is acceptable in lieu of the self balancing design. <br>  <br>  <br> Question 7:  Under Specification f, States automatic height sensor system shall provide flexibility and minimum operator input. Each shelf is stored automatically without any intervention from the operator.  All storage shelves are repositioned automatically placing the most active items near the access while at the same time, freeing up the maximum available space. This specification is actually part of a system that is commonly referred to as a shuttle system not a Lektriever/Vertical carousal.  Answer: See Question and Answer 4, Delete this requirement f. <br>  <br> Question 8: Under specification g, The unit shall have a transition counter approximately 35 quote mark  in height (minimum 30 quote mark  and maximum 40 quote mark ). Can this counter be a fixed standing at 40 quote mark  high or a fixed seated at 30 quote mark  high?  Answer: Standing height is required. <br>  <br> Question 9: Under specification h, The unit should have an automatic on and off interior task lighting integrated into the unit.  This normally would be in a shuttle specification not a Lektriever/Vertical Carousal system. I believe that when someone put these specifications together they may have cut and pasted the wrong specifications, however I could be wrong.  Answer: The unit shall have automatic task lighting. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br> Question 10:  Under specification I, Can you please restate the dimensions that are listed.  I want to make sure I understand the dimensions that are shown.  Normally I would say a unit would be 8'W which is wide left to right by 11' deep front to back by 7.5 feet high; however these dimensions do not sound right to me unless I am misunderstanding them. This is probably something that can be answered more clearly at the walk-through. Answer: Room can be measured at site visit. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> Question 11: Under specification m, Workmanship-All workmanship shall comply with standard trade practices.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel, equipment, and services required to install and test unit and any software.  NOTE: There has been no previous mention of software or what type of software that the system should have or not have. Answer: Software and programming is part of the security and access control feature. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> Question 12:  Under specification o, Documentation-The contractor shall provide complete documentation, all manuals, drawings, and schematics of installed equipment. The contractor shall provide all necessary information and software documentation, so that the government can program and repair the system independent of the contractor, after the government inspects, accepts and takes ownership of the equipment. NOTE: Again, there is no previous mention of what type of software has to be provided with the system.  Also, most manufacturers provide a one year warranty on parts and labor, should anybody else during that time try to work on these units then the warranty becomes null and void.  However, this does not mean that the government cannot pay to have their personnel go through a factory authorized training program and be certified to work on the equipment.  Normally there would also be a charge for this service. Answer: See question and answer 11. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> Question 13: Warranty-The contractor shall guarantee all workmanship, warranty all equipment, software and installation for a minimum period of 1 year. NOTE: Again I mentioned that there is no previous mention of what type of software is to be furnished with this system so therefore there can be no warranty for the software. Answer:  See question and answer 11. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>Quantity: This is a Solicitation for 60,000 EA of NSN: 5310-01-353-1834. <br /><br />This procurement is coded "1-B - Competitive/Source Control Item", and solicitation is being issued on an "UNRESTRICTED" basis. This solicitation requests offers on a stock basis only, and will contain a Quantity Option for an additional 60,000 EA, to be exercised within 60 days before contract's expiration date, if demand warrants. Expected delivery is 200 days.</p>
<p>Trade Agreement Act, applies. <br />Small Business Sub-Contracting Plan may apply.</p>
<p>All offers shall be in the English language, and preferably in US Dollars. Offers must be provided in a unit price including two decimal places. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This solicitation contains a 100% Quantity Option [additional 60,000 EA] to be exercised within sixty (60) days before contract's expiration date, if demand warrants. The offeror must provide a detailed delivery schedule (total quantity delivery, phased deliveries, etc.) for covering both the original, and optioned quantity.</p>
<p>NSN: 5310-01-353-1834 DOES NOT have Surge &amp; Sustainment requirements.</p>
<p>Lowest Price Technically Acceptable will be used as the source selection method for this acquisition. The Government will make an award as a result of this solicitation to the responsible offeror offering the lowest price and taking no exceptions to the terms and conditions of the referenced solicitation.</p>
<p>The process and controls for communication with industry shall follow the procurement integrity regulations in accordance with FAR 3.104. The Contract Specialist shall serve as the point of contact for all solicitation related inquiries from actual or prospective offers and ensure that procedures exist to safeguard source selection information and contractor bid or proposal information. The solicitation will be issued for a minimum of 30 days, and shall be advertised in FedBizOpps, along with amendments, if any. A hard copy of initial proposals shall be sent to the Business Opportunity Office. Formal discussion communication if negotiations are deemed necessary shall consist of authorized emails, facsimiles, and phone conversations. Final proposal revisions must be sent to the Business Opportunity Office.</p>
<p>The pricing analysis will be performed on a comparative basis. Proposals will be evaluated to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. The resultant contract will be based on the technically acceptable, lowest evaluated priced proposal.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be the non-price factor in the evaluation process and will be defined as an offeror that takes no exception to the terms and conditions in the solicitation. Proposals being evaluated against the technical acceptability requirement will receive a rating of acceptable/unacceptable:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated and rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the following:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating no major issues, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below)</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating major issues. Any instances of major quality discrepancies that have not been promptly remedied will be deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. [FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)].</p>
<p>Evaluation of offers will be conducted in accordance with the evaluation procedures noted and required within, clause FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999); this clause states, "...the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered". Past Performance, including Technical Factors as indicated by the Offeror's Automated Best Value System (ABVS) Delivery Score and in combination with Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) as the primary factor used to evaluate an Offerors' overall proposal. All evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price become more important.</p>
<p>Past Performance evaluation will be applied to offerors, and sources of supply.</p>
<p>After proposals are determined technically acceptable, they will be evaluated based on price submission for inclusion in the competitive range. The Government may hold discussions with an offeror to rectify any deficiencies. If an offeror's initial proposal is technically deficient as to make the proposal technically unacceptable, the Government reserves the right to reject the offeror's proposal as unacceptable regardless of the cost or price offered.</p>
<p>After discussions occur to rectify deficient proposals, the competitive range will be determined. Offeror's not determined to be in the competitive range will not be considered for an award and they will be notified in writing via a Unsuccessful Offeror Letter.</p>
<p>The Source Selection Authority will determine which proposal was determined to be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. This factor, along with past performance, will be the basis for selecting the awardee.</p>
<p>A written notice of award, or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />The proposed contract is a Fixed Price Contract, and will contain a 100% Quantity Option [additional 60,000 EA] to be exercised within twelve (12) months from contract award date. Contract due date will be effective at the time the total quantity had been shipped, including the optioned quantity, if exercised. The anticipated award date is April 30, 2013.<br /><br />For additional information, please contact Pedro J. Morales-Rivera, (215) 737-5154, or email a request to Pedro.Rivera@dla.mil.</p>

All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account. Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at https://sam.gov/. Vendors must also request and be approved for explicit access to each solicitation in order to view the secure packages. For any additional questions or help please visit the SAM Help Desk, which can be accessed by selecting the Help Tab at the top of the SAM homepage.<br />

(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly? (1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <BR> <BR>(2) [ ] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror?s TIN.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

As such, it is imperative that the magnetic tapes used for backup be both covered by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty and not cause errors during either the backup process, or during any potential file restore process.   Previous attempts to use non-standard brands of tape caused errors to occur during nightly backup processing, resulting in an increased number of hours needed for the support staff to troubleshoot and correct, and adding a high level of risk to the Agency backup process. <BR> <BR>No Section 508 standards apply to this solicitation as it is for the purchase of a media storage device. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Additional Questions and Answers:
<p>Q: 7. Page 1 Section - LARGE commercial postage meter machine This section has a requirement for Commercial Based Pricing. Commercial based pricing does not offer the full discount allowed for all Federal Government Agencies. It is suggested to Census Bureau to maximize available discounts from the USPS by changing this requirement to Commercial Plus Pricing. Commercial Plus Pricing is for all Federal Agencies replacing Commercial Based Pricing, maximizing available USPS discounts.</p>
<p>A: The USCB will consider commercial plus pricing in the bids submitted. The solicitation can't be changed at this point.</p>
<p>Q: 8. Requirement states mail system should have the ability to process 300 letters per minute, but does not mention the weigh on the move speed. Typical large volume systems process 310 letters per minute same size mail and 205 letters per minute in weigh on the move.</p>
<p>A: Please include the weigh on the move speed in the proposal.</p>
<p>Q: 9. Later on page 2 the speed listed is 250 to 300. A speed of 250 to 310 letters per minute is a big characteristic variation. We request that the speed be set to a specific minimum amount closer to what the Agency expects in speed.</p>
<p>A: The expected speed is 300 LPM for the volume of letters processed.</p>
<p>Q: 10. The Statement of Work requires a web-based system that allows for one database. Is it implied that the vendor host the system? Does USCB require the vendor to perform all administrative functions on the database? Does USCB require one web based consolidated report that can be produced by the system that consolidated data for USPS and Express Carriers from each of the 8 systems?</p>
<p>A: The USCB will host the system and perform all administrative functions on the database. The USCB does require one web based consolidated report that can be produced by the system for consolidated data from each of the 8 systems to be submitted to Finance for payment.</p>
<p>Q: 11. Page 2 Commercial Postage Meter Machines<br />Requirement states "USCB needs the rental of 195 Information Based Indicia barcode (IBI) commercial digital postage meter machines. This requirement is not defined any further in the SOW or pricing grid. Can the Agency provide further details on this requirement such as speed and connectivity requirements of these 195 systems to the central database?</p>
<p>A: The commercial digital postage meter machines provided by the vendor needs to incorporate the IBI (information based indicia barcode) to enhance the security of the postage metering. This barcode is printed by the postage meter with the postage to be placed on each mail piece. This IBI is in conjunction with the commercial based pricing or commercial plus pricing; whichever is offered. See the attached information from the Domestic Mail Manual regarding approved postage meters through USPS.</p>
<p>Q: 12. Page 3 lists installation date of Jan 7, and page 4 requires training to be completed by Dec 21. What is the required installation/training date?</p>
<p>A: The required installation date would be within 30 days of the award of the contract.</p>
<p>Q: 13. Page 7 states "Quotes should NOT include more than 7 total pages of information five (5) pages for Past Performance, one (1) page for Pricing Support information and one (1) additional page of basic quote information." There is no room for Technical Information on the proposed system. Are additional pages allowed to explain the proposed system and the technical approach to satisfying the requirements of USCB?</p>
<p>A: Yes, additional pages are allowed to explain the proposed system and the technical approach to satisfying the requirements of USCB.</p>
<p>Q: 14. Industry standard for mailing equipment is typically acquired via the GSA Supply Schedule. This solicitation is Open Market. Does USCB look more favorable to a GSA offering?</p>
<p>A: Yes, USCB looks more favorable to GSA offering with regards to pricing.</p>

<p>WELDERS - Receive rate prescribed for craft performing<br />operation to which welding is incidental.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p>END OF GENERAL DECISION</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong>POC:</strong> Anthony O'Tapi, USTDA <br />1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600 <br />Arlington, VA 22209-3901 <br />Tel: (703) 875-4357 <br />Fax: (703) 875-4009
<p><strong><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Gboyega Akintobi<br />Oando Gas &amp; Power Limited<br />Tender Committee <br />9th Floor<br />No. 2 Ajose Adeogun Street<br />Victoria Island, Lagos<br />Phone No: +234 (1) 270 2400 Ext. 6446</p>
<p>Oando Gas &amp; Power Limited (the "Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic viability of deploying compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations around Lagos State (the "Project") in Nigeria. The feasibility study will consider the requirements and the viability of utilizing existing fuel retail outlets and constructing new CNG stations to strategically provide adequate spread and access across the state. The study will assess the requirements and develop plans for CNG infrastructure (i.e. gas supply sources, mother stations, transportation) and refueling stations (i.e. locations, gas supply, construction issues); identify and analyze policy and regulatory issues; perform an assessment of the demand for CNG from industry, electric power producers, vehicle, and other markets; and assess the economic and financial viability of the Project.</p>
<p>The Project will develop the CNG infrastructure off of Nigeria's growing pipeline network. It is anticipated that the first phase of the Project will rollout approximately ten to fifteen CNG daughter stations within the Lagos metropolitan region, which will be supplied with CNG by the mother station which is currently under construction by the Grantee. The second phase of the Project will likely implement an additional mother station with its own respective daughter stations in order to provide an adequate spread of refueling locations and access to CNG across Lagos State. In addition to the mother-daughter stations, it is estimated that at least ten CNG retrofit and CNG vehicle maintenance and repair facilities will need to be established throughout the state. The establishment of this CNG infrastructure will facilitate the development of multiple industries, likely including small scale captive electric power generation and industrial processing using CNG as feedstock or fuel.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $494,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM, Local (LAGOS) Time, January 25, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<br />Please note the deadline for submission of proposals has been extended to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM, Local (Lagos) Time, January 25, 2013</span></strong>.

<DESC>This announcement was amended to correct the e-mail address for Mr. John T. Gallagher (<a href="mailto:JohnT.Gallagher@ams.usda.gov">JohnT.Gallagher@ams.usda.gov</a>).<br /><br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Marketing Service, 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250 is seeking vendors who can provide Operations and Maintenance for an AMS hosted Microsoft CRM (Customer Relationship Management) COTS solution. This solution, titled Country of Origin Labeling Functional Analysis for Compliance and Trends System (COOL FACTS) is an operational CRM solution that supports Country of Origin Labeling Program. <br />Country of Origin Labeling is a labeling law that requires retailers, such as full-line grocery stores, supermarkets, and club warehouse stores, notify their customers with information regarding the source of certain foods. Food products, (covered commodities) contained in the law include muscle cut and ground meats: beef, veal, pork, lamb, goat, and chicken; wild and farm-raised fish and shellfish; fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables; peanuts, pecans, and macadamia nuts; and ginseng. Commodities are excluded from mandatory COOL if they are considered processed food items. The COOL program ensures compliance with the regulation by conducting retail surveillance activities (retail reviews) and supplier traceback audits in grocery stores across the country that meet the requirements of COOL. The COOL FACTS application consists of an internal CRM solution that is utilized by AMS personnel to administrator the COOL Program and a secure externally facing .Net portal that is utilized by State cooperating agencies, (approximately 400 users). The portal includes functionality to manage retail review assignments; supervisor review capability; invoice submission; and user account update features. Both technical components of the solution are hosted locally on virtualized Windows 2008 servers. Other components of COOL FACTS include SQL Server 2008 Enterprise, CRM 2011 Enterprise, and a Microsoft Unified Access Gateway (UAG) device. AMS owns all software, hardware, and licenses to support this solution. AMS hosts both a Pre-Production and Production environment for COOL FACTS. This permits for comprehensive testing of any builds prior to production release. The COOL FACTS solution went live in April 2012. The support period with the incumbent expires in February 2013. AMS is soliciting vendors who have experience in maintaining large CRM solutions. AMS is not interested in teaming arrangements for this requirement. This is requirement includes:
<p>1. Operations and Maintenance Support:</p>
<p>The vendor shall be able to demonstrate a proven ability to support, maintain, and keep operational, a large, complex enterprise level CRM solution. The vendor should have a deep understanding of the CRM framework, relational databases, security implications, and customized workflows with CRM.</p>
<p>AMS has onsite Tier 1 and Tier 2 support staffed by government personnel. This support is able to handle basic and intermediate COOL FACTS technical questions and problems.</p>
<p>AMS is looking to compliment this with a deeper set of technical support services. These support services should be able to affectively understand initial report, diagnosis the problem, troubleshoot the problem, isolate, correct, test, and then deploy code fixes and/or minor changes to the system to keep the system operational and online.</p>
<p>AMS believes that a mix of onsite and offsite support services would be optimum. AMS will provide onsite access, office space, and network access including a computer to work from. AMS does not believe that full time support is needed for this requirement.</p>
<p>Major enhancements to the system are not included under item. Major enhancements will be undertaken periodically under a Fixed Priced Contract outside of Item 1. Those enhancements will be itemized and cost out separately.</p>
<p>2. Transition Period</p>
<p>AMS will provide funding for the vendor to undertake a transition period of one month. This transition period will permit contractor support staff to familiarizes themselves with the COOL FACTS solution. This will allow more effective troubleshooting of the solution, once complete.</p>
<p>A vendor/industry conference to view the system will be held on February 1, 2013 from 9:00 am - 11:00 am Eastern Standard Time at the U.S. Department of Agriculture South Building located at 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20250. Please contact Mr. John Gallagher via e-mail at <a href="mailto:JohnT.Gallagher@ams.usda.gov">JohnT.Gallagher@ams.usda.gov</a> if you plan to attend this conference. The conference will be approximately two hours (one hour to view the system and one hour for question and answers.) This is the only date vendors will be allowed to view the system. Vendors who are interested in this requirement are requested to submit the following information: (1) Capability statements regarding your company; (2) past performance information on contracts of similar size and scope of this project; (3) proven delivery history; and (4) three or four references. If available, please provide any available contracting vehicles such as Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC) or existing Federal Contracts that can satisfy this requirement. Questions regarding this requirement must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer, Beverly Brown, at BeverlyS.Brown@ams.usda.gov. All responses to this notice must be received by 2:00 pm EST February 8, 2013. Please send information to: Mr. John T.

<DESC>AMENDMENT:  <br> On 18 December 2012, the CIO/G-6-AAIC approved version two of the Integrated  Network Baseline Technical Architecture (INBTA) for NIE 14.1.  These documents are intended to provide technical architecture guidance for each NIE event so companies can better align their research and development resources with the capabilities the Army is seeking.  Feedback from you is important to the future development of iterative INBTA documents.   <br>  <br> NIE 14.1 DESCRIPTION <br> 1.)  The US Army Directorate for System of Systems Integration (hereinafter referred to as SoSI) is seeking interested sources with mature solutions to enhance existing network systems capabilities to participate in a Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) event scheduled to occur in October/November 2013 (referred to as NIE 14.1) at Ft. Bliss, TX and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  The purpose of this notice is to identify emerging capabilities to be evaluated against a set of entrance criteria for an opportunity to participate in an NIE. This Sources Sought seeks solutions with a narrow focus on Specific Identified Gaps in the current and evolving networked equipment solution set.  Functional requirements for these gaps are listed in Paragraph 2. These gaps are:  <br>    <br>  Gap 1: Brigade/Battalion Command Post (CP) Mobility and Scalability  <br>  Gap 3: Network Visualization on the Common Operational Picture (COP)  <br>  Gap 5: Aerial layer Network Extension - Provide assured access for terrestrial network  <br>  Gap 8: Integrated Network Assurance - Network Access Control  <br>  Gap 16: Operational Energy - Energy sources with extended duration and power  <br>  Gap 17: Operational Energy - Monitor and manage system power, supply and demand   <br>  Gap 19: Operational Energy - Reduce reliance on petroleum based energy  <br>  (Gap numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 18 are reserved)   <br>    <br>  2.) The NIE is an Army hosted event conducted twice a year. The NIE is approximately two to six weeks long and employs the full brigade strength of a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at Fort Bliss, TX.  The goal is to conduct parallel systems tests of Army programs, evaluation of new network technology capabilities, non-network capabilities and emerging in-theater capabilities and concepts. The NIE events will include tactical exercises using current force equipment and emerging networked systems.   <br>    <br>  3.) This is a Sources Sought announcement. This does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There is no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted or demonstrations provided in response to this Sources Sought announcement. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information or demonstrations provided by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.    <br>    <br>  4.) Sources must understand the entire financial burden of participating in this process to include: submitting a White Paper, briefing, and Training Support Package; attending and providing an Oral Presentation at the System Under Evaluation (SUE) Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM); submitting solution candidates for laboratory testing at a Government facility; undergoing integration and Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) at Aberdeen Proving Ground , MD through the duration of NIE;  participating in pre-NIE integration activities; training soldiers to operate the candidate solution; and participating in; supporting the candidate solution in the NIE event at Fort Bliss, TX and White Sands Missile Range, NM and post-NIE de-installation and recovery activities  will be the sole financial responsibility of the source.    <br>    <br>  5.) The Government will provide a venue for an Oral presentation, assessment services and venue for the candidate solution laboratory testing, integration risk reduction venue, host platform and services and access to the NIE site and facilities.  The Government may provide integration support to integrate candidate solutions into military platforms and assist in network integration where applicable.     <br>    <br>  6.) Eligible Respondents: The Sources Sought process as part of the NIE is open to US and non-US industry. Respondents that are not able to provide a solution to one of the Specific Identified Gaps with a solution that is rated at a Technical Readiness Level  of  six (TRL-6) or better (see ATTACHMENT 2) or are not able to participate throughout the entire NIE process should not submit a initiate this process by preparing a White Paper. Potential respondents are encouraged to review this entire document thoroughly and carefully consider their ability and willingness to fully participate in the process up to and including the NIE prior to committing to submit a White Paper.   <br>    <br>  7.) Connection to a Classified Network:  The NIE 14.1 will incorporate classified capabilities at some tiers of network integration.  The government may change the classification of the network due to operational and test needs at any time.  Source's proposed solutions to be utilized on the classified portions of the network will be required to meet the Information Assurance (IA) requirements of the classified network. Changes to the network classification may preclude proposed systems from participating in the NIE. The source's equipment if incorporated into the NIE may be exposed to classified information and could result in the need to sanitize the equipment after the event.  This process may include the retention by the Army or destruction of the data storage elements of the source's equipment (e.g. hard drives, flash drives, CDs, non-volatile memory.)  Support personnel will be required to have a current SECRET security clearance.  The Government may provide DIACAP accreditation support to candidate solutions without a government sponsor/Designated Approval Authority (DAA) where applicable.  <br>    <br>  8.) Government Program of Record Candidates:  If your potential candidate solution is being funded under a Government program of record, you are advised to contact your Government program manager regarding the suitability of submitting the candidate for the NIE as a vendor candidate.  There is a separate concurrent process for submitting Government candidate solutions to the NIE and your Government program manager may have programmatic concerns about exposing the candidate to the NIE concurrent with program execution.   <br>    <br>  *REFER TO ATTACHMENT(S) FOR CONTINUATION OF NOTICE REQUIREMENTS*

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice for planning purposes. This RFI notice is being issued for the purpose of assessing industries' current capabilities in providing energy efficient Ice Making Systems for use by military services in various theaters of operations.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  Any information provided does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas. Neither Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the PM FSS will take procurement action in this matter.   <br>     <br>  BACKGROUND: The remote locations of base camps create significant challenges for logistics support of combat operations, in particular bagged ice production.  These base camps are heavily dependent on large, long-distance truck convoys whose cargo is dominated by water and bulk fuel.  Convoy routes through unsecured areas are frequently hazardous, and transport is always expensive.  PM FSS is in the process of initiating dramatic steps toward rapidly improving the logistics support required to establish and operate base camps.  Information received from this RFI may be used to help identify technical solutions suitable for rapidly enhancing ice making capability at base camp operations.  Information received may ultimately result in requests for equipment manufacturers to demonstrate their ice production capabilities at no cost or risk to the Government as early as May 2013.  <br>    <br>  PURPOSE: PM FSS is interested in understanding the currently available capabilities that could enhance the bagged ice need sustainability of remote operating bases engaged in combat operations.  This RFI focuses on technologies and equipment that addresses energy ice production systems to meet the ice production need of 3,600lbs per day.  Technologies of interest are those that would most effectively produce and automatically bag ice in support of a base a base camp supporting 600 personnel with 300 additional personnel located forward.  Information is requested in the form of brief product descriptions.  The current concepts of use for these Ice Making Systems will be for extended periods of time are to replace convoy provided ice supply in operational theaters when deployments. Primary functional uses of these systems will be as ice production systems to automatically produce the ice and deliver in sealed bag.     <br>    <br>  PLAN: The PM FSS is seeking Companies or Government agencies to demonstrate Ice Making Systems at Ft. Devens, MA starting on or after 20 May 2013 for a minimum of 90 days through December 2013.  Due to limited field space available to have companies demonstrate their products, PM FSS reserves the right to select only a small number of potential solutions being offered from the responses received.  PM FSS plans on investigating each selected Ice Making System for ice production capability, ability to meet the requirements of producing and bagging ice and operational efficiency.  Each company selected will receive an independent PM FSS assessment of their commercial product only.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to invite interested respondents to submit information regarding possible Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) that will allow the Government to advise respondents about their potential to be viable competitors. <br>  <br> Pre-Solicitation Preparation Instruction for OCI <br>  <br> Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) provide independent testing and evaluation of systems for the Army. 10 U.S.C. 2399(d) requires the impartiality of contractor testing personnel and contractors providing advisory and assistance services for systems they develop, produce or otherwise test. 10 U.S.C. 2399(d), as implemented by the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, Chapter 9.4, states,  quote mark Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) shall be conducted independent of system contractor manipulation or influence during the IOT&E or associated activities that provide input for the consideration in the system evaluation. quote mark  ATEC is concerned with both actual and potential conflicts of interest.  The offerors shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, copy of Statements of Work to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Offerors shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  Included shall be an electronic copy of your company's latest annual report to stockholders since this document discusses the company's involvement in various programs.  The offeror shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  <br> In the context of OCI, involvement is defined as any participation or connection to a project, contract, program, or product which may create actual or perceived OCI.  This includes participation in contracts that provide engineering or technical support to sponsors or program offices responsible for developing such systems. This must include all subcontractors, joint ventures, teaming arrangements, etc. Subcontractor OCI is equivalent to a prime contractor OCI. The Contracting Officer will review statements provided by each offeror as to the developmental work the company has performed; evaluate the submittals considering in-house knowledge as to the company's program support; determine whether or not there is an OCI on a case-by-case basis; and provide the offeror with the opportunity to provide a mitigation plan which the Contracting Officer will also consider.  The Government may also consider information available from other sources. Any communications that occur are strictly limited to OCI issues of the offeror and their subcontractors. They will not constitute exchanges under the provisions of FAR 15.306. As a result of OCI Evaluations, the Government will advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or based on the information submitted that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government will inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  <br> Offerors shall submit their OCI proposals electronically by emailing them to the Contract Specialist at:  claudetta.n.smith.civ@mail.mil and the Contracting Officer at theordore.h.panknin.civ@mail.mil .  The file shall be submitted in a format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office (2007 or earlier) and is limited to no more than ten (10) pages in length. When electronic submittal is not possible due to file size limitations, offerors may submit two hard copies of their OCI proposal to the following address: <br>  <br>  			Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Hood <br> 			Mission Contracting Office <br> 			ATTN:  Contracting Division - ATEC (CD-A), Ms. Nikki Smith <br> 			Headquarters Ave., Bldg 91035 <br> 			P. O. Box Y <br> 			Fort Hood, TX 76544-0770 <br>  <br>  <br> Electronic and/or hardcopy versions shall be received at the address above not later than 30 January 2013 at 3:00 pm CST. Submissions not received by the deadline of 30 January 2013 at 3:00 pm CST will be handled as a Late Proposal subject to the rules in subparagraph c of FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition. The Government will provide a response to all respondents no later than 6 February 2013.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command, Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201), intends to competitively award a single firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to either ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS INC. (ATK) (CAGE Code: 70272) or KDI PRECISION PRODUCTS, INC/L-3 COM (L-3) (CAGE Code: 66126), for the acquisition of the FMU-139C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze, (NSNs: 1325-01-535-6160, 1325-01-535-6164, 1325-01-517-2822 and/or 1325-01-517-2828) for the United States Navy (USN) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The objective of this effort is to contract with either of the two currently approved and qualified sources to produce and deliver a limited quantity of FMU-139C/B fuzes. This competition is restricted to existing qualified sources and this award will not be delayed to qualify additional sources. Both of the above listed firms are currently under contract to produce and deliver FMU-139C/B fuzes in accordance with FMU-139C/B Electronic Bomb Fuze Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003. In addition, both firms were found, via a previous limited competition effort, to have technically acceptable proposals for the production of FMU-139C/B fuzes produced in accordance with Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003A. L-3 is currently under contract, and in production to deliver, FMU-139C/B fuzes in accordance with Performance Specification PMA-201-03-003A. The production units intended to be procured under this effort shall meet the requirements of the Performance Specification PMA201-03-003A. It is noted that the First Article Test (FAT) requirement is part of the specification. Use of qualified sources will mitigate risk of invalidation of previously obtained FMU-139C/B safety certifications and flight clearances for military aircraft. The above listed firms are the Original Equipment Manufacturers for their respective designs of the FMU-139C/B fuze and all associated technical data is proprietary. As the only designers, developers, manufacturers and suppliers of the FMU-139C/B fuze, the above listed firms possess the peculiar engineering capability, resources, expertise, intricate knowledge and proprietary technical data necessary to satisfy the Government's need and schedule requirements for the FMU-139C/B fuze. Initial production deliveries are required twelve months after contract award. This acquisition is being pursued under the statutory 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A determination by the Government to limit this competition to qualified sources is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data required to purchase this component from other sources. Subcontracting opportunities may be available and should be sought by contacting the above listed firms.</p>
<p>Comments shall be submitted via electronic mail (email) in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel format, or Portable Document Format (PDF). When submitting, please include company name, address, point of contact, email address, phone number and fax number. All responses must be unclassified. If including proprietary information in the response: (1) ensure proprietary information is marked appropriately; and, (2) identify disposition instructions. Any information that is not marked as proprietary will not be considered as proprietary and may be subject to disclosure to third parties. Comments must be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. on XX December 2012 to either Mr. David Andreoli at david.andreoli@navy.mil or Mr. Jamie Billig at jamie.billig@navy.mil or mailed to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT, ATTN: Jamie Billig, AIR 2.4.4.3, SUITE 256, BLDG 2272, Patuxent River, MD, 20670.</p>
<p>The Government will review all comments or requests for information received prior to the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP), but will only post responses if deemed necessary. No response will be provided to any question or comment with proprietary or restrictive markings.</p>
<p>Industry is reminded that responses to this synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective Offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation, though requests for information related to this posting may be considered. This synopsis IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government in determining or planning its acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse interested sources for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in Fed Biz Opps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>Once NAVAIR finalizes its requirements for the subject effort, a prerequisite for receiving a contract award is in the DOD's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. For more information on the CCR, contact the CCR Assistance Center at (888) 227-2423 or website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking information regarding the disassembly and radiological surveying of General Electric LM2500 Marine Gas Generators used aboard US Navy surface ships. NAVSEA seeks to determine the industry capability, estimated costs, and steps required to complete the following: - Receive radiologically contaminated US Navy LM2500 Gas Generator Assets - Establish or possess a facility capable of processing LM2500 Gas Generator - Execute a complete disassembly of the asset in accordance with existing US Navy technical documents governing the depot overhaul of the LM2500 Gas Generator which will be provided. - Radiologically survey and disposition each part according to their level of radiological contamination as either above or below the permissible limits as defined the American National Standard Institute Standard (ANSI) 13.12 and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Regulatory Guide 1.86 (less than 1000dpm per 100 square cm loose or removable contaminants and less than 6000dpm per 100 square cm total).
 - Package uncontaminated parts for shipment to a USN designated repair facility for further processing. - Package contaminated parts for commercial transport and disposal. - Dispose of any radiologically contaminated by-products resultant from the disassembly and survey of the LM2500 Gas Generator. Follow-on efforts will be dependent upon the result of the first asset processed. Description: As a result of operation in radiologically contaminated areas, the US Navy currently has forty-five (45) LM2500 Marine Gas Turbines with Gas Generators operating under radiological controls. Due to the nature of the contamination, no US Navy facility is currently available to process the affected engines either for decontamination or repair following a failure.
 The LM2500 is the main propulsion unit for the CG-47 class cruiser, the DDG-51 class destroyer, and the LCS-2 variant class ship as well as the main propulsion unit for several ships under the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Without a US Navy facility to repair the affected engines, each one must be disposed of as hazardous waste requiring replacement with new assets. The US Navy is seeking to leverage capabilities in commercial industry to determine if either decontamination or repair of these assets is a less costly option compared with new procurement. The Navy anticipates that, should decontamination/repair of radiologically controlled assets prove economically beneficial, a total throughput of forty-five (45) LM2500 assets will be processed.
 All assets would be delivered in US Navy shipping containers. These containers would have to be opened in a radiologically controlled environment and all items inside the container as well as the interior of the container itself subject to radiological controls. All handling and required tooling would similarly be under radiological controls for the duration of work and would require decontamination before a return to regular stock or special disposal if decontamination is not possible. Processing of radiologically controlled items may generate radiological waste products (metal shavings, waste water, etc.) which would also be classified as radiologically contaminated and would require either special packaging or decontamination prior to disposal.
 Handling and disposal of waste products would be the responsibility of the contractor. Repair and overhaul work of radiologically contaminated assets requires a separate working area that meets national and state requirements for the handling of such assets. NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses a facility or would need to construct a facility for this effort. Compliance to Standards: The ANSI 13.12 and NRC Regulatory Guide 1.86 are existing standards that support this effort. Respondents will need to obtain an agreement state license or NRC state license prior to accepting any US Navy radiologically controlled assets. Disassembly procedures for the LM2500 Marine Gas Generator are marked DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D (Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD contractors only; Critical Technology).
 A technical data package can be provided upon request and upon verification that the requestor is a bona fide US Department of Defense (DOD) contractor familiar with the procedures to handle technical data package materials that may include limited distribution information. Evidence in the form of a fully signed and approved DD Form 2345 (MILITARY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT) will be required prior to receipt of the technical data package. Please request the technical data package via email to the following address: mark.e.burns@navy.mil. Responses: NAVSEA is seeking industrys feedback and commentary on the scope, schedule and rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs associated with disassembling and radiologically assessing a single LM2500 Gas Generator as well as rough order of magnitude costs associated with radiologically assessing follow-on LM2500 Gas Generator assets by September 30, 2013.
 The Navy is also interested in responses to the following questions: 1. Disassembly of the LM2500 Gas Generator requires special tooling to complete a full disassembly. NAVSEA requests that respondents indicate whether or not they currently posses the required tooling, have a means to procure the tooling, or would require the tooling be provided as Government Furnished Material. If respondents posses partial tooling, NAVSEA requests a listing or ROM to procure what additional tooling would be required. 2. Identify an existing or develop a ROM estimate for the construction of a facility capable of isolating and disassembling the LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine Engine (MGTE), all associated tooling and equipment, and personnel to maintain radiological controls at all times until all contaminated items are officially cleared by the US Navy for release.
 3. Provide a ROM cost for the recurring engineering costs to continue to process LM2500 radiologically controlled assets. 4. For respondents that need to construct a facility, provide an estimated timeline for construction and state certification of the facility. 5. For respondents that will contract out radiological inspections, provide a ROM for sub-contracted costs and identification of intended performers. 6. NAVSEA requests a notional timeline for the following where applicable: a. Construction and certification of a radiologically controlled facility b. Subcontract award for radiological assessments c. Procurement of required tooling d. Disassembly of an LM2500 Gas Generator asset e. Radiological assessment of LM2500 Gas Generator disassembled components f.
 Cleaning/decontamination of the LM2500 Gas Generator components g. Packaging of uncontaminated/decontaminated parts for shipment h. Packaging of contaminated parts for shipment Responses and comments are requested by 4:00 pm (EST), on February 4, 2013. However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning. Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed. Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files. All inquiries and comment submissions should be emailed to mark.e.burns@navy.mil.
 The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and should not contain proprietary information. However, if some of the background on the comments provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider. This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing future strategies for the handling of radiologically contaminated LM2500 Gas Generator assets.
 Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary. No written responses will be returned.

<DESC>**Purpose of synopsis modification is to correct the performance date.**

NAVSEA Indian Head on behalf of the Joint Staff (JS) intends to award a sole source contract to Grant Thornton LLP of Alexandria VA. The intended contract would be in support of task order N00178-12-D-6886 FG01. Grant Thornton has been performing under this task order since 9/25/2012. As part of their performance, a discovery phase has been completed which identified the need for additional support for Washington Headquarter Services (WHS) and the National Defense University (NDU), of which the JS is the ERP service provider. For another company to provide these services, it would result in a substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through competition.
 In addition, awarding to another vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the audit readiness requirement. It would take another contractor 6 months to get to the point where GT is, resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Therefore, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, the government intends to award a sole source contract for the additional support services to Grant Thornton.

<DESC>This project is 100% Set Aside for Small Business. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction services include strengthening a 3,380-foot section of the Bradley Canyon Levee, Santa Barbara County, CA. The levee will be strengthened by two methods: installing a steel combi-wall and constructing a soil cement revetment. The new combi-wall will connect to an existing combi-wall and will be installed at the crest of the Bradley Canyon levee along a 1,000-foot section. The combi-wall consists of king piles and sheet piles. The king piles and sheet piles will be driven to depths of approximately 64 feet and 52 feet, respectively. The upstream end of the combi-wall will overlap with the downstream end of the soil cement revetment. The soil cement revetment will be constructed against the existing levee at a slope of 2 horizontal: 1 vertical and have a width of 8 feet. The soil cement will extend approximately 2,380 feet and will have a vertical height of approximately 30 feet. Approximately 19 feet of the soil cement height will be buried. A section of the Bradley Canyon levee will be raised with compacted fill by a maximum 1.6 feet. The existing low flow will be diverted during construction and restored after construction is completed. The estimated cost of this project is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.

(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>
