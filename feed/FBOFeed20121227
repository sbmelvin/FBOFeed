<p>It is the intent of the Postal Service (specifically the Western Facilities Construction CMT) to assemble a list of prequalified firms for projects of this type, and that when the need arises, to solicit offers from prequalified firms, and only prequalified firms, based on the specific solicitation requirements of each individual projects as the need arises.</p>
<p>The Scope of Work for any project may include, but is not limited to, roof, boiler, and chiller replacements, other mechanical system-related projects, interior renovations, both industrial in nature as well as administrative office improvements and modifications, pavement replacements and other projects requiring site work, electrical systems including, but not limited to, switchgear repairs and replacements, security system upgrades and installations as well as other large-scale renovations and modifications that can become necessary in a diverse facility portfolio.</p>
<p>The Western Area is generally defined as encompassing the following states, or parts thereof:</p>
<p>Alaska&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nebraska<br />Arizona&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Mexico<br />Colorado&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oregon<br />Idaho&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Dakota<br />Illinois&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Dakota<br />Iowa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utah<br />Kansas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington<br />Minnesota&nbsp;&nbsp; Wisconsin<br />Missouri&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wyoming</p>
<p>The Western Area contains approximately 8,500 Postal Service facilities, of which approximately 116 are in excess of 50,000 interior square feet (sf), and approximately 65 are in excess of 100,000 interior sf.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of any single project is between $3,000,000 and $10 million, with construction completion times based on the specific circumstances and scope of each project.<br />Once assembled, this list of prequalified firms will remain in place for approximately three (3) years, and firms having been prequalified and placed on this list by the Western Facilities Construction CMT will not be required to re-submit their qualifications within the following three (3) years in order to receive such solicitation notices; however, the Postal Service reserves the right to require a firm to re-submit and/or update their qualification statement should inferior contract performance dictate, or any other pertinent information be presented that warrants a re-evaluation of a firm's qualifications.</p>
<p>All prequalified firms will be notified when a project meeting these criteria is being solicited within this geographic area. There shall be no obligation on the part of any prequalified firm to submit an offer to the Postal Service for any specific project, and no firm will be removed from the prequalified list due to that firm having not submitted an offer on any specific solicitation.</p>
<p>While it is the intent of the Western Facilities Construction CMT to solicit specific project offers from only prequalified firms, the Western Facilities Construction CMT reserves the right to solicit offers in the "open market" should it be determined that doing so is in the best interest of the Postal Service.</p>
<p>The exact number of future projects meeting the criteria outlined herein cannot be practically determined; however, it can be stated that approximately ten (10) projects meeting these criteria have been solicited in the Western Area in the past three (3) years. This does not guarantee or necessarily imply that any specific number of such project(s) will be issued within the next three (3) years.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATION: The qualification statements will be evaluated by qualified Postal Service employees and/or Postal Service contracted professionals. Primary factors to be considered are: company background; contract experience; financial stability; capacity to perform - with emphasis on multiple projects at one time; timely completion history; references; bonding capacity; and safety.</p>
<p>TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE QUALIFICATION STATEMENT PACKAGE PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED PDF DOCUMENT:</p>
<p>All contractors will be advised of their status within 60 days after the solicitation closes.</p>

(1) Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. In the event an offeror proposes products that are other than the Brand Name specified, the offeror shall submit with its proposal information sufficient to comply with the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal as follows: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- (1)	Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by- (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. (2) Price - The prices offered shall be submitted in accordance with the Schedule of Supplies and Services contained in the solicitation. Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. (End of Text) <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: (1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the CLIN descriptions, Submission of Quotes, and Evaluation of Quotes and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. (b) The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>R--Facilitator for two graduate level Naval War College classes to be conducted in Pearl Harbor, HI and Newport RI

<RESPDATE>011113
<ARCHDATE>01262013

<DESC>The U.S. Naval War College has a requirement for an individual to conduct a non-resident Combined Force Maritime Component Commander (CFMCC) course in the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii area and an Executive Level Operational Level of War (ELOC) in Newport, Rhode Island. The CFMCC course is taught in this area to support regional maritime commanders and senior leaders attending (as students) and lecturing (as guest speakers) at the course. NWC resident faculty members prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses. Because the course attendees are 1 and 2 star US and foreign flag officers, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course.

The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, operational experience in maritime warfare at senior/executive levels, familiarity with the regional maritime issues, an understanding of Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level.
 The ELOC course is tailored for an officer in the rank/pay-grade of Navy Captain/O-6 on the numbered fleet staff to bridge educational gaps between courses offered for the Flag level and those offered to officers in the pay-grades of O-2 through O-5. The course is taught at the NWC campus in Newport, RI with students assigned TAD for the week long ELOC. NWC resident faculty prepare and coordinate the course syllabus, procure teaching materials, and fund administrative expenses.

Because the course attendees are senior O-6s, it is necessary to contract an individual who can serve as a senior fellow and support faculty for the course. The qualifications for this position are unique and identical to those required to support the CFMCC course.

For these reasons the Naval War College, Contracting Division, intends to award a Sole Source/Firm-Fixed price contract to The Costello Group.
 VADM (Ret) Costello has fleet experience as Third Fleet Commander which gives him the necessary expertise and perspective for facilitating the CFMCC course in Pearl Harbor, HI and the ELOC course in Newport RI. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c) (1) and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), the supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.

A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government. Even though the intent is to award a sole source contract, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
 A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

The solicitation (RFQ) number will be N00124-13-T-0139 and is expected to be issued on or about 12/29/2012 with a closing date of 11JAN2013.

Questions may be directed to sheila.valloney@usnwc.edu

<p class="MsoNormal">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code 541711 (Research and Development in Biotechnology) for food allergen detection from food samples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">An antibody-based technology that has shown a high level of reliability with sensitivities comparable to or better than ELISAs is xMAP technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This bead-based technology has been demonstrated to be reliable in the detection of various proteinaceous toxins in foods (Garber <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman Italic&quot;;">et al</span></em>. 2010) with a throughput exceeding ELISA test kits since each analytical sample can be simultaneously screened for multiple analytes and subjected to a confirmatory test process. Further, by employing antibodies used in ELISA test kits and dipsticks, the properties of the antibodies are already known. This eliminates some of the evaluative processes necessary before a method can be adopted and makes the method compatible with other methods currently being employed by the food industry and contract labs. The instrumentation for xMAP technology, the Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) or Luminex 100/200 System (Luminex Corp., TX, USA) is currently available to most FDA field labs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The objectives for the FDA&rsquo;s Food Allergen Muliplex Assay are as follows:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Establish      a commercial product line for the detection and confirmation of the      presence in food of egg, gluten/wheat, milk, peanut, crustacean shellfish,      soy, or tree nut (e.g., almond, hazelnut, walnut, Brazil nut, cashew,      coconut, macadamia, pistachio) allergens to support the regulatory      enforcement of the Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA)      and the Gluten-Free regulation currently under review by FDA senior      management;</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The FDA is looking for qualified firms willing and capable of assembling these assays to achieve these objectives. Minimum qualifications include:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in;">Demonstrated      evidence of experience employing X-MAP validated methods in application to      food allergens.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in;">Demonstrated      evidence of experience employing ELISA antibodies in relation to the      testing for food allergens.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While a qualified contractor does not have to have prior experience in both of the above areas, it is expected that subcontracting will be utilized in the assembly of the assays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interested SMALL BUSINESS ONLY should submit their capability statements )no more than 10 pages in length to: Christopher R. McGucken, Contract Specialist, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20851, no later than 12pm (noon) EST on January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2013.

<DESC>THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN SOURCES SOUGHT<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (SS-RFI) ONLY <br />AS DEFINED BY FAR 15.201(E)
<p>1.0 Overview:<br />The Department of State (the Department) requests that interested businesses provide specific evidence that they are capable of meeting or exceeding the Department's minimum objectives identified below. The Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), Office of Consular Systems and Technology Services (CST), is issuing this Full and Open Sources Sought/Request for Information (SS-RFI) for planning purposes only in support of the Department's market research. This does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Department does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this SS-RFI, or any subsequent RFP. This announcement is only a request for information and in no way commits the Department to award a contract. Responses to this notice will not be considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Department to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>1.1 Background: <br />The Department (in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has developed and implemented U.S. card-format travel cards: the Passport Card and Border Crossing Card (BCC)-credit-card-size travel documents. The Passport Card has been an accepted alternative to the traditional book-style passport at U.S. land and some sea ports-of-entry (POEs) since June 1, 2009. The Passport Card is functional in the DHS ReadyLane system, an integrated, automated border-crossing identification system including programs such as NEXUS, Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), and Free and Secure Trade Program (FAST). The Department also issues a Border Crossing Card (BCC) to qualified citizens of and residents of Mexico. The BCC allows them to enter defined border zones in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas for business and pleasure. When presented together with a valid Mexican passport, the BCC allows the holder to travel for business or pleasure to anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>1.2 Scope: <br />The Department is seeking information regarding Passport Card stock to continue the production and printing of Passport Cards at projected volumes using current equipment. The Department is also seeking information regarding BCC stock to continue production and printing of BCCs using current equipment. Further, the Department is seeking information on Radio Frequency (RF) Attenuating Sleeves, card printers, card readers, and the available technical support services that could facilitate the production, personalization or intended use of the card.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Department may use the card stock and support infrastructure, such as printers and readers, to create additional types of travel cards. These travel cards would be functionally similar to the Passport Card but would be used to denote other travel privileges.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />2.0 Vendor Submission Instructions: <br />Vendors that believe they possess the expertise and experience to fulfill all or portions of the requirements listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) section, Attachment A, are invited to please:</p>
<p>1.

Submit a written description of technical and management capability and experiences. <br />3. Provide a description of the solutions that deliver the requested components and services or support the development, deployment, and maintenance of the components. As part of your submission, please address the following: (a) solution description and key features; (b) performance characteristics; (c) any security considerations; (d) degree of customization or configuration anticipated to meet the Department's requirements; and (e) cost drivers.<br />4. Discuss any implementation considerations you believe are relevant to the initiative as a whole. This discussion may include salient risks and mitigation measures, lessons learned from other projects or agencies, contracting approaches, or any other pertinent information.<br />5. Provide relevant examples of previous work or solution implementations, to include client points of contact (POCs).<br />6. Do not provide sales brochures, videos, and other marketing information materials. These are not solicited and will not be reviewed.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, submit Non-Proprietary Information. All information received in this SS-RFI that is appropriately marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to this SS-RFI will not be returned nor will receipt be confirmed.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to format their response with the following sections and adhere to the page limits shown:<br />1. Proposed technical concepts, products, and deliverables (not to exceed 15 pages)<br />2. Past performance directly related to the identified products addressed throughout this document (not to exceed 3 pages)<br />3.

<p>&emsp;<br />Attachment A - Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>1.0 Statement of Objectives (SOO):<br />The primary objectives the Department expects to achieve include obtaining information on the following products and services: <br />Cards<br />&bull; Preprinted RFID enabled Passport Card stock, ready for personalization<br />&bull; RFID enabled Passport Card Test stock, ready for testing in Passport Card Personalization System<br />&bull; Preprinted RFID enabled BCC stock, ready for personalization<br />&bull; RFID enabled BCC Test stock, ready for testing in the Passport Card Personalization System<br />&bull; RF Attenuating Sleeves for RFID enabled cards<br />&bull; Automatic Card Inspection Equipment <br />&bull; Card Delivery System</p>
<p>The Department requires that Vendors shall not sell, give, or transfer to any other government, entity, or person, any products, materials, and/or processes unique to United States Passport Card and BCC or their production.</p>
<p>2.0 Technical Requirements:</p>
<p>2.1 Cards</p>
<p>Passport and BCC Stock <br />The Passport/BCC Card shall meet ISO 7810 ID-1 specifications and follow the guidelines of ICAO 9303 Part 3 Volume 1 Sections IV and V recommendations for TD-1 Documents of Identity where applicable. In case of conflict, use ICAO 9303.</p>
<p>Passport/BCC Card will display information similar to that of the data page of the current U.S. Passport book:<br />&bull; On the Passport Card front: citizen facial image and biographic information<br />&bull; On the Passport Card back: MRZ for ID-1 type document compliant with ICAO 9303 Part 3 Volume 1 Section IV part 9, and Section V parts 6-9 and appendices 3 and 6.</p>
<p>The Passport/BCC Card shall have further machine-readable capability with an embedded RFID capable integrated contactless circuit (ICC) and antenna. The ICC shall store only a manufacturer-encoded number that shall be unique to the specific card.</p>
<p>The Passport/BCC Card must serve as a tamper-resistant and physically secure (counterfeit deterrent and alteration deterrent) and durable travel document that will permit Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers to use RFID equipment to read the ICC number onboard the Passport/BCC Card in order to access data from a DHS database, to read the MRZ encoded personalized data on the back of the Passport Card/BCC card using passport readers designed to read ICAO 9303 MRZs, and to confidently inspect the card on its face value.</p>
<p>Card Stock Mandatory Features<br />Card body material shall:<br />a. Be nontoxic (presents no toxic hazard in the course of personalization and normal use).<br />b. Be compatible with ICC components that enable each card to function as a passive RF responder.<br />c. Be compatible with a DataCard MX6000 printer utilizing a first generation laser and have material receptive to laser energy, so that tactile printing can be done per personalization concepts. Material must be deep enough in card to prevent tactile print removal without clear tamper evidence. <br />d. Be composed of polycarbonate layers with no adhesive usage or equivalent for which the Vendor must provide sufficient evidence that alternate will not degrade durability performance compared to polycarbonate. Vendor must provide sufficient evidence that any layers fused in the construction of the card cannot be intentionally split or otherwise compromised to facilitate alteration after production and will meet all other requirements herein.</p>
<p><br />Card Stock Pre-Printing<br />The pre-printing shall not rub off or fade during the life of the Passport Card, nor shall the printing process deposit debris on the personalization printer. Pre-printed card stock pattern and features, offered security features, and the offered personalization process shall not interfere with the ICC and related card components, nor shall it obstruct access to machine-readable information.</p>
<p>RF Attenuating Sleeves and Optional Privacy Features <br />Privacy of citizens is a primary concern of DoS and DHS. Privacy features enable a cardholder to effectively activate and deactivate a Passport Card. The Department believes multiple privacy features maximize privacy protection and prefers a privacy solution that includes both an attenuating sleeve and additional privacy protection features that default to the deactivated state. At a minimum, Vendor shall propose RF Attenuating Sleeves that meet the requirements described below:</p>
<p>RF Attenuating Sleeves shall be of a material that will enclose the card stock, so that the card stock comes out only with manual effort of the holder. The Sleeve material will have RF reading single layer shielding effectiveness of at least 40 dB, compared to unshielded card RF reading for a frequency in the 860 to 980 MHz range. RF Attenuating Sleeves shall not affect the function of a removed card after repeated insertions and removals over the life of the Passport Card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2 Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Transition Plan, Disaster Recovery (DR) plan<br />The Department will require a specific SOP, Transition Plan, and Disaster Recovery plan including plans for a six-month level of emergency stock.</p>
<p>Deliverable Warranties<br />The Department requires details from the Vendor on how they produce a card that will remain fully functional after passing through the personalization process. "Fully functional" means that the card fully communicates and operates in a normal working environment based on the requirements within this document.</p>
<p><br />Respondents are reminded to follow explicitly the instructions provided in the SS/RFI. Your cooperation and compliance will ensure a prompt and thorough review and analysis of your submission.</p>

<DESC><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE<br />12TC004613P0006A
<p><br />The 802d Contracting Squadron, Lackland Air Force Base intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Contract to Nuance Communications, 3984 Pepsi Cola Drive, Melbourne, Florida 32934 for the renewal acquisition of maintenance and services on the Dictaphone Transcription System</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for a commercial service for which the Government intends to award to one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the government will consider all proposals of approved alternate systems, received within five business days after date of publication of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of request for quotation.</p>
<p>The justification for this sole source procurement is that Nuance is the only source that can provide this service for WHASC due to the installation of the Nuance Dictaphone System. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c) (1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p><br />DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE<br />AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND</p>
<p>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />Dictaphone Transcription Hardware, Software and Maintenance Services</p>
<p>I. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: This document constitutes justification and approval for limited sources for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR Part 6. It is executed on behalf of 59 MDSG/TW7/MLRS, Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center (WHASC), Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5300 by the 802nd Contracting Squadron.</p>
<p>II. NATURE OF ACTION: Request for acquisition by limited sources for Dictaphone Transcription Hardware, Software and Maintenance Renewal for WHASC for specific software (Brand Name) through Nuance Communication, 1 Wayside Road, Burlington, MA 01803-4609.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The WHASC Systems Department currently utilizes Dictaphone System by Nuance Communications in its current location. This department's software is up for annual maintenance renewal. Due to the nature of the existing hardware and software, maintenance supplied by other vendors would not be compatible with the existing system. It could create improper functioning of software and hardware. When the equipment functions improperly it could cost the government additional funds for repair. WHASC currently utilizes Nuance Communications Dictaphone equipment for transcription services.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTARY AUTHORITY: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 201 of 40 U.S.C. 501, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Acts of 1949, as implemented in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>V. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE: Nuance Communications is currently the only company that can provide this service, simply because of the hardware, which is a Nuance Product, only serviced by Nuance Communications (proprietary). Subscription available for annual maintenance. Market Research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), advertisements from the Google search engine, and GSA E-buy. No other vendor has retail sales rights due to copyright issues.</p>
<p>VI. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE: Nuance Communications is currently the only known company that has On-Line Database renewal service for the Dictaphone Transcription Service.</p>
<p>VII. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THIS JUSTIFICATION: To use another source for Dictaphone Services, would involve total change-out of the current system (software and hardware); creating additional expense.</p>
<p>VIII. Future Action to Ensure Competition: Will issue sources sought as needed as other requirements are identified.</p>
<p>IX. Contracting Officer Certification: The contents of this justification are accurate and complete to the best of the knowledge and belief of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>X. Technical/Requirement Certification: The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified to be complete and accurate by the appropriate management level of the technical/requirement organization. (See Approval Page)</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is based on and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business and the intent of this procurement is to award based on Sole Source requirement. The proposed contract action is for commercial items which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR subpart 27.4. The anticipated award date is 12 Jan 2013. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63 dated 10 Dec 2012 and DFARS Change Notice 20121116 dated 16 Nov 2012. Standard Industrial Code 7035, North American Industry Classification System Code 511210 and Size Standard of $25 Million apply to this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate and award without discussions on this procurement. The intent of this procurement is to award based on sole source requirement. Quotes are not being requested and written solicitation will not be used.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-186-0859<br />Name:		Cleaner, Marker Board, 16 oz.<br />Description:	16 ounce marker board cleaner in pump spray bottle that cleans and reduces shadowing on all whiteboards, erasable marker boards, melamine and porcelain steel boards. Not intended for chalkboard surfaces. UOI is BT.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			6850-01-186-0859<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	QRT550</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF.

PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 27 DEC 2012 AT 1400 PST. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>ART IN ARCHITECTURE PROJECT<br />GSA Synopsis for Artist Services<br />Artist Services Synopsis Number:  GS-09P-13-KT-C-0003
<p><br />FBO Classification:  R499<br />NAICS:  711510</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the new construction of U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>This project provides for the construction of a new courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, CA. The site/design and construction prospectus will be designed to meet the amended 30-year requirements of the U.S. District Courts and related agencies with the initial build-out to house the 10-year housing requirements.  The Project involves the design and construction of an approximately 600,000 gross square foot courthouse, including 110 controlled-access indoor parking spaces, in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>This Project is an opportunity in design and construction excellence. GSA intends to build a new United States Courthouse that shall be a focus of pride for the community it serves, as well as the nation. The Project shall be a functional, innovative, sustainable, cost-effective, state-of-the-art, court facility that will contribute to the overall design quality of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the new U.S. Courthouse project is currently estimated to be $1,500,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artist Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on January 25, 2013.. &nbsp;Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.  If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at william.caine@gsa.gov or 202.501.4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.  GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Tunis, Tunisia as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Tunisia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2011, long-time President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled Tunisia after one month of youth-led protests fueled by socioeconomic grievances, corruption, and political repression.  The revolution ushered in a wave of political excitement for Tunisia and prompted the initial steps towards democracy and political reform.  USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) seeks to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society and more equitable, responsive, and legitimate governance.  In particular, the program provides material and technical support to communities, civil society organizations, and local institutions to help build democratic resiliency, increase citizen participation in democratic life, and bolster positive change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Country Representative to provide oversight and management of OTI's country program in Tunisia.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Middle East (ME), or his/her designee, as well as to the Chief of Mission or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Tunisia program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>1. The purpose of this amendment is to answer offeror questions and to update the anticipated solicitation release date. <br>  <br> 2. The following questions have been submitted in response to the pre-solicitation notice, accompanied with Government answers: <br>  <br> Question 1: Where will the place of performance be? <br> Answer 1: Performance will occur in Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar and other countries as necessary. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 2: Am I correct that this RFP is not yet available for viewing? <br> Answer 2: Yes, that is correct. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 3: Is this a new effort? What is the current contract number? What is the name of the incumbent contractor? <br> Answer 3: This effort is a follow-on contract to two separate contracts: W52P1J-12-C-0023 and W560MY-12-C-0012. The name of the incumbent contractor is CACI Dynamic Systems, Inc. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 4: Please clarify the Government's plans relative to the use of  quote mark personal services contracts as stated in the pre-solicitation notice. <br> ANSWER 4: As stated in the pre-solicitation notice, resultant contracts will be personal services contracts in accordance with FAR 37.104. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 5: Please clarify if it is the Government's intent to award multiple contracts using lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures and if competitive task orders will then be awarded based on lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures. <br> Answer 5: The Government intends to award multiple contracts using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Procedures. Competitive task orders will be awarded based on LPTA. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 6: Please clarify the use of two NAICS references within the pre-solicitation notice and if they are both applicable: 541611 and 921190 <br> Answer 6: The applicable NAICS for this acquisition is 541611. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 7: We request and recommend the Government consider allowing contractors to propose and execute requirements of the performance work statement based on number of hours rather than number of FTEs. This would allow a smaller, less expensive workforce to execute the work requirements by working for example 78 hours versus 60 hours per week per person.  <br> Answer 7: The Government has extensive experience with the requirements of this acquisition. As such, the Government will direct offerors to provide a fixed number of FTEs per location.  <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 8: Will a security clearance be required? <br> Answer 8: Yes. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 9: Will remote/telecommuting be permitted? <br> Answer 9: Telecommuting will not be permitted.  <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 10: Please let us know how many FTEs are required for this solicitation. <br> Answer 10: This information will be included in the solicitation. <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 11: Does the contractor need to have an office near Rock Island, IL or will telework be an acceptable solution? <br> Answer 11: Offerors do not need to have an office near Rock Island.  <br> ***** <br>  <br> Question 12: Will the Government consider issuing a separate set aside solicitation for qualified 8(a) firms, small disadvantaged businesses, women owned small business, or HUBZone or to support some of the anticipated requirements? <br> Answer: FAR Part 19 does not apply to contracts being performed overseas; therefore, in accordance with ACC-RI practice, the requirement will be solicited as full and open/unrestricted competition.  <br> ***** <br>  <br> 3. The revised date for the solicitation posting is 03 January 2013. <br>  <br> 4. Inquiries and questions shall be e-mailed to Ms. Liz Zaharopoulos at Elizabeth.w.zaharopoulos.civ@mail.mil <br>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing construction services to conduct VOR counterpoise structure refurbishment in Bermuda. The detail requirements are identified in the attached DRAFT Specifications and DRAFT Drawings.  

The anticipated contract period is 125 days.  The FAA estimates the contract value to be between $700,000 and $800,000.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a size standard of $33.5 Million.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 15 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  

PURPOSE:

This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:

All respondents must provide a Capability Statement that addresses the following (in order):

a. Type of services provided by your firm that demonstrate ability to perform the services described in the Specifications.

b. Services provided under previous contracts that are similar in size, scope and complexity to this effort (in this instance, experience in counterpoise structure refurbishment, dealing with U.S and Bermuda import/export laws and operational requirements such as transportation restrictions,  certification of trades, in addition to other regulations  required by the government of Bermuda - See Section 1 of the specification).  Provide detailed information and past performance information for at least three (3) previous contracts including program title, customer name, project dates, project value, customer point of contact, and description of work performed.

c. Respondent's access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, etc, if necessary to perform the contract.  If subcontracting, teaming, or partnering arrangements are anticipated, those arrangements must be identified, as well as the estimated percentage of the total effort that each subcontractor, partner, or team member will provide of the total effort.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:

In order to be considered responsive, organizations expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:

a. Capability Statement (as defined above)

b. Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Allergen Multiplex Assay</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code 541711 (Research and Development in Biotechnology) for food allergen detection from food samples.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">An antibody-based technology that has shown a high level of reliability with sensitivities comparable to or better than ELISAs is xMAP technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This bead-based technology has been demonstrated to be reliable in the detection of various proteinaceous toxins in foods (Garber <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman Italic&quot;;">et al</span></em>. 2010) with a throughput exceeding ELISA test kits since each analytical sample can be simultaneously screened for multiple analytes and subjected to a confirmatory test process. Further, by employing antibodies used in ELISA test kits and dipsticks, the properties of the antibodies are already known. This eliminates some of the evaluative processes necessary before a method can be adopted and makes the method compatible with other methods currently being employed by the food industry and contract labs. The instrumentation for xMAP technology, the Bio-Plex (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) or Luminex 100/200 System (Luminex Corp., TX, USA) is currently available to most FDA field labs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The objectives for the FDA&rsquo;s Food Allergen Muliplex Assay are as follows:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Establish      a commercial product line for the detection and confirmation of the      presence in food of egg, gluten/wheat, milk, peanut, crustacean shellfish,      soy, or tree nut (e.g., almond, hazelnut, walnut, Brazil nut, cashew,      coconut, macadamia, pistachio) allergens to support the regulatory      enforcement of the Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA)      and the Gluten-Free regulation currently under review by FDA senior      management;</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The FDA is looking for qualified firms willing and capable of assembling these assays to achieve these objectives. Minimum qualifications include:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in;">Demonstrated      evidence of experience employing X-MAP validated methods in application to      food allergens.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; text-align: center;" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">-or-</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in;">Demonstrated      evidence of experience employing ELISA antibodies in relation to the      testing for food allergens.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While a qualified contractor does not have to have prior experience in both of the above areas, it is expected that subcontracting will be utilized in the assembly of the assays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interested SMALL BUSINESS ONLY should submit their capability statements )no more than 10 pages in length to: Christopher R. McGucken, Contract Specialist, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grant Services, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20851 or Christopher.Mcgucken@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 12pm (noon) EST on January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2013.

<DESC>United States Marine Corps effort for systems capability upgrades to Live training Gaps within the Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE). The Live training toolkit baseline system is Instrumented Tactical Engagement Simulation System II (I-TESS II). The capability enhancements are not currently available within the I-TESS II toolkit. This effort includes all Program Management, Engineering, Testing, and Logistics tasks associated with developing the capability upgrades. In addition to the development of the system capabilities a verification of the training systems to meet the SITE capability gaps will be conducted upon completion of development. The system upgrades will conform to the Instrumented- Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) specification and ensure compliance with the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA is the foundational architecture for the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS) strategy. CTIA consists of standard architecture services, components and protocols, and it facilitates commonality across the various training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) and joint training environments. The Government seeks suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.
<p>The SITE specific capability enhancements are as follow:<br />1. Mortars - Integrate mortar firing capability, paring sensors, ballistic computer, and forward observer device (M224, 60mm and M252, 81mm) into baseline system.<br />2. Assault-Squads - Integrated MK153 shoulder launched multipurpose assault weapon (SMAW) simulator capability, paring sensors, day/night sighting, and back blast mechanism (non-pyrotechnic) into baseline system.<br />3. Anti-Armor - Integrated M220 TOW and M98A1 Javelin simulator capabilities and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />4. Machine Guns - Integrated MK 19 Instrumented Weapon System (IWS) simulator, Small Arms Transmitter (SAT) and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />5. Close Air Support - Provide a Forward Observer capability to effectively simulate call for fire and provide visual cues to the effect of the munitions. The effect will illustrate persistent CAS weapons impacts. The capability will include audio recordings at the tactical radio for use in the AAR into the baseline system.<br />6. Sniper Marksmanship - Integrated M107 long range sniper rifle (LRSR) and M110 semi-automatic sniper system (SASS)- SAT Sniper rifle capability, paring sensors and the Forward Observers use of existing Fire Control Devices while minimizing laser safety issues into baseline the system.</p>
