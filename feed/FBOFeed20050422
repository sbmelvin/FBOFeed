Considerations include: (1) Educational background; (2) Experience on similar projects in a position comparable to that for which they are being proposed; (3) Certification or professional registration held by the individuals proposed for key personnel positions.  4.  MANAGEMENT PLAN & SCHEDULE . This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.  Considerations include:  (1) Submission of a detailed logic diagram, arrow-on-arrow (minimum 200 activities), illustrating the proposed sequencing of work and clearly defining the critical path.  Submittals, including shop drawings and samples and long lead time items should be indicated as separate activities; (2) Submission of a tabular schedule printout indicating, at a minimum, activity, activity duration and total float; (3) Submission of a narrative management plan describing how the offeror intends to execute the work in the field. Particular attention should be placed on the sequencing of work and on how the offeror intents to manage their subcontractors.

Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.     If selected for award, the offeror’s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  

The GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A-E) Design Services for a new, single tenant headquarters (HQ) building at the St. Elizabeths Hospital West Campus, located in Washington, DC, for the needs and missions of the United States Coast Guard.  The headquarters building will contain approximately 1.1 million gross square feet of space.  The HQ will meet Federal Energy goals & security requirements, will be designed in metric (system international) units, and will be LEED certified.  The HQ building will comply with U. S. Building Codes and U. S. Government requirements, to include Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), as well as applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The Estimated Construction Cost for the HQ building is in the range of $225 million to $270 million.  

The entire site was established in 1855 as a government hospital for people with mental disabilities. Its early mission, as defined by one of its founders, Dorothea Dix, was to provide the most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.  The current site include over 300 acres, is a historic site, and includes a military graveyard for American Civil War Soldiers.  St. Elizabeths Hospital, located on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, bisects the site into a West Campus and an East Campus.  The East Campus was deeded to the District of Columbia in 1987.  The federal government maintains control over the West Campus.  The West Campus is a rich collection of buildings, landscaping and green spaces, plus views and vistas that are extraordinary.  It encompasses 176 acres of land, containing approximately 50 buildings.  The entire West Campus, including buildings and landscaping, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  “Brand Name or Equal”.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center plans to award a five year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for Huntron ProTrack 1 Model 20B Signature Analyzer with Scanner 1 and Carrying Case or a brand name or equal product.  The formal solicitation is expected to be released the week of May 2, 2005.  For each item, we anticipate an estimated quantity of 100 units per year.  The solicitation will be a small business set aside and the size standard is 500 employees. FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items will be used on this procurement.   The Huntron ProTrack Signature Analyzer is the test set used for developing diagnostic repair routines (Gold Disk).  Gold Disks are developed for specific circuit card assemblies (CCAs) or electronic modules (EMs) and provide a standard to which fleet technicians may compare suspected faulty CCAs or EMs.  It is imperative that any test set proposed must be 100% backward compatible with the current Gold Disk library.  Diagnostic routines developed for a new tester must be downward compatible with the current configuration to ensure all deployed test stations are capable of testing all CCAs and EMs for which Gold Disks have been developed or which may be developed.  A more detailed description of the minimum technical requirements, which the proposed tester must meet will be specified in the solicitation document.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government’s requirements, (2) Price, and (3) Past Performance.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>The project will consist of preparation of a suitable seedbed, seed native and non-invasive vegetation, control noxious weeds and irrigate until the plants are well established.  After establishment of native and non-invasive plant species is achieved (2 years) the water rights will be removed.  Irrigation water will be temporarily transferred by the Navy to the 300-acre buffer zone until native plant species are established.  Native and non-invasive plant communities at NASF typically consist of salt desert shrubs, Four-wing Saltbush, Shadscale, Greasewood, Quailbush and perennial bunch grasses such as creeping wild rye, wheatgrass, and alkali sacaton. The precipitation average in this desert is 5 inches per year. To control the soil erosion and restore the native habitat, the weeds need to be controlled and the 300 acres replanted. This project shall convert old agricultural lands, 300 acres, to native and non-invasive vegetation. Irrigation water is available from the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (April-November). Graded border irrigation is the method of irrigation used in this valley. This parcel was irrigated last in 1998. Re-vegetating Agricultural Outleases with native and non-invasive plant species complies with the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Management of the Greenbelt at NAS Fallon, The NAS Fallon Agricultural Outlease Land Management Plan, State of Nevada and Churchill County dust control regulations.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate an award of a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Suburban Hospital, 8600 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. NHLBI initiated four (4) protocols on cardiac diseases in which Suburban Hospital is the sole cohort.  The NIH does not have a sufficient patient population or skilled research nursing staff essential to assure development of theses protocols.  As such, the NIH requires regular access to patient populations that include acute cardiac patients such as those at Suburban Hospital.  The protocols also require the service of skilled research nursing support o provide on-site enrollment, processing, and follow-up of patients at Suburban Hospital.  It is essential that these resources be in close proximity to the NIH campus to facilitate prompt access to NIH investigators and other available NIH clinical resources that may be required, especially in emergency situations.    STATEMENT OF WORK:  To further the clinical, applied, and basic research, training, and education components of its activities the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) requires access to patient populations that include acute cardiac patients such as those at Suburban Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland.  The NHLBI DIR does not have a sufficient patient population or skilled nursing staff essential to conduct multi-center studies and requires these resources to assure protocol development.  The NHLBI DIR requires the services of skilled nursing support staff located at Suburban Hospital to enroll and process patients in the multi-center clinical research protocols listed below that have been approved by the NHLBI and Suburban Hospital Institutional Review Boards:  Protocol 92-H-0189: Evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease (Screening protocol) (NHLBI-Suburban Hospital) The principal mission of the NIH is the conduct of research that elucidates biological mechanisms, pathogenesis, and treatment of disease.  Patients with known or suspected cardiovascular diseases are referred to NHLBI cardiologists for consideration of participation in clinical research protocols.  However, eligibility for participation is often uncertain from referral information or even after an outpatient evaluation.  The purpose of this protocol is to permit inpatient evaluation of patients for whom participation in clinical research protocols is under consideration in order to determine protocol eligibility by means of conventional laboratory and cardiovascular testing.  Protocol 03-H-0250:  Technical Development of Interventional Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NHLBI – Suburban Hospital) Cardiovascular interventional procedures are minimally-invasive, catheter-based treatments such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting.  These procedures generally can be conducted on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional open surgery.  Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by physicians manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic x-ray.  We are developing minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MR Fluoroscopy.  These procedures have the advantage of excellent imaging without surgery and without radiation exposure or toxic contrast agent.  Moreover, because MR Fluoroscopy can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood, and of three-dimensional structures, it may be possible
 to guide minimally invasive procedure not possible even with invasive surgery.  Purpose:  
The purpose of the protocol is to develop and test incremental technical advances in patients. 
Protocol 03-H-0086:  Stem Cell Mobilization for Improvement in Vascular Function and Myocardial Perfusion in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Rehabilitation (NHLBI – Suburban Hospital) This study will look at the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation exercise program on release of stem cells from the bone marrow and on heart function.  Stem cells are primitive 
cells produced and released by the bone marrow, circulate in the bloodstream and develop 
into white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.  Some stem cells may also develop into other kinds of cells, including those that make up heart muscle, especially if the heart has 
been damaged or is not getting sufficient blood.  Stem cells called endothelial progenitor 
cells (EPCs) are thought to form new blood vessels that can carry blood to areas of the heart muscle that are oxygen-deprived because of clogged arteries.  Previous experiments have shown that some EPCs can be forced out of the bone marrow by exercise.  This study will examine whether repeated exercise and lifestyle changes increase the number of EPCs released into the bloodstream and if these cells improve heart and blood vessel function.  Protocol TG001-03: A Phase 1-2, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Prospective Study to Evaluate the Safety and Potential Efficacy of Single, Increasing Doses of TG100-115 in Subjects Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Acute Anterior ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NHLBI – Suburban Hospital) This is an exploratory study designed to obtain preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic date in human subjects with the targeted disease indication.  The subjects enrolled into the study will be undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following
 an acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.  The study is a pilot and is not powered
 to achieve statistical significance but is designed to provide sufficient data for the design of future studies with TG100-115.  Therefore a series of endpoints will be used to help define 
the primary and secondary objectives of future studies.  Of particular interest will be the 
inter-subject variance of infarct size using the two specified methodologies witch will help determine the assessment of infarct size in the pivotal studies. Nuclear imaging studies for 
this purpose will be conducted at the Clinical Center.  Location of Work:  Suburban Hospital 8600 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, Contact Person: Gene Passamani, M.D. Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs, Period of Performance:  One (1) year upon award of purchase order.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS), NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, INTENDS TO SOLICIT PROPOSALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES AS 
RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN COMPLEX DISEASE. THE MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING A UNITED STATES NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY.  A SECOND MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING THREE INDIVIDUAL, DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE).  THIS WILL INVOLVE  RESEARCHING RELEVANT ISSUES AND MAKING A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH.  PREVIOUS TWIN STUDIES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF THIS TYPE OF FAMILY DESIGN IN ETIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.  THE USE OF TWINS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE STATISTICAL POWER OF A GENETIC STUDY BY EXPLOITING THE UNIQUE DEGREE OF SHARING (BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL) AMONG TWINS.  COMPARISON  OF CONCORDANCE RATES FOR A TRAIT OR DISEASE AMONG MONOZYGOTIC (MS) AND DIZGOTIC (DZ) TWINS ALLOW  FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THAT CONDITION IS DUE TO HEREDITARY SHARED OR NONSHARED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE MAJOR TASKS AS FOLLOWS: (1) PROVIDE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT POPULATION OF TWINS IN THE US AND STRATIFY THEM INTO DEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS BASED ON THEIR ZYGOSITY, AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, SES, URBAN LIVING CATEGORIES, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITHIN THE US, ETC.  THIS WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY SUB-POPULATIONS WITH CONSISTENTLY LOW RATES OF RESEARCH PARTICIPATION WHOM MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CONSIDERATIONS. (2) PROVIDE IN-DEPTH CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE U.S. THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TYPE 1 DIABETES, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, OR SYSTEMIS LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  AS PART OF THIS TASK INVESTIGATE AND DESCRIBE THE PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN EXISTING TWIN REGISTRIES AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN TWIN RESEARCH PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY REGISTRIES, ACADEMIC, OR OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  (3) EVALUATE THE ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING A NATIONAL AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DISCUSS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY (HIPAA) AND THE PRIVACY ACTS AND HOW HEY MIGHT AFFECT ESTABLISHING THESE REGISTRIES OR DISSEMINATING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE, AND HOW THESE ISSUES RELATE TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN, SUBJECTS WITH DIMINISHED CAPACITY, WOMEN, MINORITIES, ETC.  (4) ESTIMATE WHAT PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS DESCRIBED IN TASKS 1 AND 2 ABOVE WOULD LIKELY BE WILLING TO ENROL IN A TWIN REGISTRY AND PARTICIPATE IN REGISTRY SPONSORED RESEARCH PROGRAMS.  THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD RECOMMEND VARIOUS ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE RECRUITMENT OF THE GENERAL US TWIN POPULATION, AS WELL AS SPECIAL ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR SUBGROUPS WITH HISTORICALLY   LOW RECRUITMENT RATES (MINORITIES, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING, WOMEN, RURAL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, LOW SES GROUPS, ETC.)  (5) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  IF SUCH A NATIONAL REGISTRY IS NOT DEEMED FEASIBLE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONCEIVE, RESEARCH AND EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OF CREATING US TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES. (6) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING RESOURCES OF TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  BASED ON THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASK 2,3, AND 4, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING THREE NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TWIN AFFECTED WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE.  (7) MEET AND DISCUSS WITH THE NIEHS PROJECT OFFICERS AND A PANEL OF EXPERTS THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  ONCE TASK 1-6 ARE COMPLETED, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COMPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT LISTING AND DISCUSSING HOW THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASKS 1-4 AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NIEHS-SPONSORED PROGRAMS MIGHT AFFECT THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED AND THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  (8) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  THIS SHOULD INCLUDE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES FOR WOMEN AND SUB-POPULATIONS WITH HISTORICALLY LOW RESEARCH  PARTICIPATION RATES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTIONS OF MINORITY SUBGROUPS.  (9) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE NATIONAL REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, SLE AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING AFFECTED TWIN RESOURCES.  FOR EACH CONDITION, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVISE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY BOTH INCIDENT AND PREVALENT CASES.  (10) ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CURRENT AND PROJECTED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE, INDIVIDUAL DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES, OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING U.S. TWINS RESOURCES.  THESE ANALYSES SHALL INCLUDE THE COSTS OF OPERATING SUCH REGISTRIES ON A YEARLY BASIS FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS.  THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS.  THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 5,772 DIRECT LABOR HOURS MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS  PROJECT.  THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODE (NAICS) IS 541710.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS  SET-ASIDE OF WHICH THE SIZE STANDARD IS 500 EMPLOYEES  OR  LESS.  THE  ANTICIPATED  RELEASE DATE OF THE RFP IS FEBRUARY 27, 2004 WITH PROPOSALS DUE BY APRIL 16, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for wind tunnel test services including model fabrication of an airfoil model customized to fit in the OSU model support system. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Ohio State University (OSU). The objective of this wind tunnel test is to compare the performance of a new airfoil design to a previous set of measurements obtained by Boeing in the same tunnel using the same test techniques and test conditions. This allows a direct comparison of data that would not be possible using any other test facility. The wind tunnel model must be constructed by OSU in order to insure compatibility with their wind tunnel model support system.  The OSU Airfoil Wind Tunnel provides airfoil data that can be compared to the previous Boeing test on the VR-7 and VR-12 airfoils in the same wind tunnel under the same test conditions. This is critical to the success of the research program since it provides a direct "apples-to-apples" comparison. The construction of the model includes customized instrumentation specific to the test techniques employed by the OSU wind tunnel. These model construction issues can only be addressed by the staff of the OSU wind tunnel based in their tunnel specifications. The capabilities of the wind tunnel to reach certain test conditions (i.e. high Mach number) make the facility unique. It is critical for the test conditions to match Mach number, Reynolds number, turbulence level, and wall corrections of the previous test. The only way to do this is to test in the exact same facility using the same techniques and model construction.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 10, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA has a requirement for the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Certification and Compliance Division (CCD).  CCD has responsibilities under Title II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of Nov. 1990 (CAAA) which include implementing certification and compliance monitoring programs for mobile source standards and rules. The objective of this solicitation is to provide CCD and other divisions within OTAQ with support in economic, environmental, statistical, financial, evaluative analyses, technical and engineering analyses, communication, outreach, guidance, regulatory program support, web computer system, and database support and development, and support for implementation and compliance monitoring of air pollution regulations and programmatic requirements. Such support may include cost/benefit analysis in support of regulations, support related to conducting voluntary programs and evaluating their results, summarizing and documenting public comments, review of state requirements, support analyzing, characterizing, estimating and presenting fuel economy data, support in developing and maintaining certification fee credit tracking systems, support in evaluating trends in compliance, performing systems design, development, installation, operation, administration, and business re-engineering, and providing support for outreach and communication.   Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor, all motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers, all firms in the field of emission control/reduction, energy efficiency and/or energy technologies, as well as point source emitters of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), air toxics, and/or particulate matter (PM).  Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual Organizational Conflicts of Interests can be either mitigated, avoided, or neutralized.  The solicitation will contain the following provision,  "Prohibition of all motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers, all firms in the field of emission control/reduction, energy efficiency and/or energy technologies, as well as point source emitters of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), air toxics, and/or particulate matter (PM)."  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	"The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the development, analysis, implementation and compliance monitoring of certain air quality regulations and requirements.  Whereas these regulations and requirements directly affect motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,  nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers,  fuel and fuel additive producers, emission control, energy efficiency and/or energy technology firms and firms that are point source emitters of NOx, SO2, HC, CO, CO2, air toxics, and/or PM, the Contracting Officer has determined that a significant potential for an actual or potential COI will result.  Therefore, any firm in an above described regulated industries will be considered ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case by case basis." The solicitation and resulting contract shall also contain the clause, "Limitation on Future Contracting."  The text of this clause will track with Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternative V (Headquarters Support), EPAAR 1552.209-74 (MAY 1994), except for paragraph (c).  Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows: 	"Paragraph c:   Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to the specific activities performed under this contract.  Specifically, enter into contracts or represent motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,  nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers,  fuel and fuel additive producers, emission control, energy efficiency and/or energy technology firms and firms that are point source emitters of NOx, SO2, HC, CO, CO2, air toxics, or PM that are affected by the policy and regulations generated from this contract if the purpose is to shield or protect the company from adhering to EPA's regulations or policies.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contract." The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 14,000 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 50% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 105,000 direct labor hours over five (5) years. THE EPA HAS SET THIS ACTION ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.   Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet.  Offerors should visit the following EPA web page (http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd) for continuous update of RFP's status.  Hard copies will not be distributed. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the EPA site for amendments.  No RFP release or closure dates have been established.  Anticipated release is late June 2005.  The NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6 million in average annual average revenue over the preceding three years.  See Note 1.

<CONTACT>Denny Braccia Contract Specialist 2155975374     Denny_Braccia@nps.gov;
<DESC>This notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source purchase order is not a request for quotes and there is no solicitation available. The Northeast Region of the National Park Service contemplates issuing a sole source purchase order to the firm of Marioff, Inc., of Linthicum, Maryland for the purchase of equipment and associated support services for a high pressure fire suppression system to be installed by NPS staff at the Atwood-Higgins House, Cape Cod National Seashore. Site conditions that require the use of this system are the lack of a water supply, frequent power outages and a lack of storage space.  These circumstances are rectified only by the Marioff GPU Water Mist System that has a water requirement for suppression of about 10% of other sprinkler systems and with no electrical power being required for the system. The system is the only one on the market with UL or Factory Mutual Approvals for Light Hazard Occupancy. 1.	Materials: The fire suppression system proposed for the above referenced project is a Gas Driven Pump (GPU) dry-pipe water mist system, satisfying requirements for NFPA Light Hazard Occupancy.  The system consists of: 1-Gas Driven Pump Unit Model GPU6A/4+4/SC (4); 9-Nitrogen Cylinders, - 300 CF @ 2640 PSI (183 Bar) 9-Nitrogen Cylinder Mounting Adapters (183 Bar) 17-Sprinklers - 1B 1MC 6MC 100A,m Light Hazard, 5m height, 3.5 m spacing 4-Sprinkler Hi-Fog 2000 C10-57 C/O 21-Mounting Adapters - A1000 B1A T1 1 D 12s 10- With check valve 1-Atmospheric Water Tank, sized for at least 270 Gal (1100 L) 21-Test Plugs 1-Air Compressor 2-Selector Valves 5-Air Control valves Support Services:	Engineering and Commissioning 2.	Summary of Work: 2.1.	Provide field engineering and as-built drawings 2.2.	Furnish materials and equipment as indicated on 	drawings and specifications, 	including all pipe 	bending for pipe sizes of 5/8" or greater. 2.3.	Furnish and install site rigging, installation and configuration of GPU system in the basement mechanical room, including mounting racks, pumps, compressors, valves, tanks, cylinders and related equipment and materials.  2.4.	Install, fill, and seal all associated tanks and cylinders. 2.5.	Activate, test and commission completed system. 2.6.	Provide on-site demonstration and training to NPS personnel. 3.	Special Expertise/ experience required 3.1	Contractor must be certified by the system manufacturer for installation and servicing of 	the proposed Marioff GPU Water Mist System. 3.2	Approvals.  The proposed system meets requirements of NFPA 750, for Light Hazard Occupancy with two exceptions.  Discharge time is limited by space available within the building for the water storage tank. Marioff has a Gas Powered Unit (GPU) that drives the System during a release (see 4.2 above) the GPU is the only one on the market with Factory Mutual Approvals for use in Light Hazard Occupancy.   This proposed purchase order is for supplies for which the Northeast Region of the National Park Service intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within forty-five calendar days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

STATEMENT OF WORK - GENERAL:  The United States Border Patrol is tasked with detecting, deterring from entering and arresting those who violate the immigration laws of the United States.  Since its inception the Border Patrol has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Occasionally these service mounts need to be replaced due to injury, disease, age or death.  In replacing service mounts, certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts.  REQUIREMENTS:  Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed.  Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government.  Age- the horse shall have a documented age between five (5) and ten (10) years of age.  (Exceptions to purchasing an older horse will be made on a case-by-case basis.).  Weight- the horse shall weigh no less than 900 pounds and no more than 1250 pounds.  Size- the horse shall measure not less than 15 hands and not more than 16.5 hands in height.  Sex- All service mounts will be altered male horses (Geldings).  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service:  Most riders have little or no experience.  The horse must be capable of carrying 200-250 lbs. of weight for long periods of time (6-8 hours/Day).  Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters.  A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment.  Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program.  SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS:  A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation.  The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition.  Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase.  Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is reviewing and, as appropriate, revising the EPA document, Air Quality Criteria for Lead, EPA-600/8-83/028aF-dF, published in June 1986, and the associated supplement (EPA-600/8-89/049F) published in 1990.  The NCEA Office in Research Triangle Park, NC  is seeking contractors  who can provide expertise and written material for various sections of Chapter 8 of the Lead Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD), which is titled, "Environmental Effects of Lead."  The  requirement was previously synopsized on March 22, 2005.  Due to lack of responses, the Chapter 8 work is being further divided into smaller tasks and subsection. Separate requests for quotation (RFQs)  will be issued for each section/subsection.  Separate purchase orders will be issued for each  section/subsection.  Offerors may choose to quote on more than one section.  The time period for performance of this work is May 2005 through April 2006, with optional tasks continuing the performance until February 2007.  NCEA is under a very accelerated litigation-related time line to produce the  first draft of this chapter by late June of 2005.  RFQs for Chapter 8 are now as follows:  RFQ-OH-05-00070 "Terrestrial Methodologies", Section 8.1.3; RFQ-OH-05-00071 "Terrestrial Species Response/Mode of Action", Section 8.1.4; RFQ-OH-05-00072 "Methodologies Used in Aquatic Ecosystems Research",  Section 8.2.3; RFQ-OH-05-00073 "Aquatic Distribution of Lead", Section 8.2.2; RFQ-OH-05-00074 "Aquatic Species Response/Mode of Action", Section 8.2.4; RFQ-OH-05-00075 "Exposure/Response of Aquatic Species", Section 8.2.5; RFQ-OH-05-00076 "Effects of Lead on Natural Aquatic Ecosystems", Section  8.2.6; RFQ-OH-05-00077 "Critical Loads for Lead in Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems", Section 8.3; RFQ-OH-05-00078 "Terrestrial Distribution of Lead", Section 8.1.2.  Services required include:  (1) preparation and submission of an expanded outline of the chapter section, a JQM/QAPP and list of  key studies; (2) participation in preliminary teleconference meeting for authors; (3) preparation of draft for peer-consultation meeting; (4) review of workshop draft of chapter; (5) attend peer-consultation workshop; (6) preparation and submission of written responses to comments from peer  consultation workshop and  first external review draft (ERD) and references; and (7) review of public comments from ERD and attendance and participation in CASAC meeting.  Optional tasks include: (1) completion of second ERD and (2) completion of final draft of Lead AQCD.  Successful performance  for this contract requires the contractor to have: (1) a strong  publication  record in the area of the section and chapter of the specific request for quotation (2)  past and current leadership positions in an academic or ecological research facility. This procurement is being conducted using  Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, Commercial Item, procedures.  Request for quote packages may be requested from schopler.angela@epa.gov or by telephone 513-487-2036.

All active employees are currently covered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program.  OTS would now like to offer a separate dental and vision insurance program to their active employees and their dependents.  Accordingly, OTS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on a firm fixed price basis for an experienced and qualified dental and vision provider(s) capable of providing and administering comprehensive dental and vision benefits for active employees and their dependents. This is an unrestricted procurement.  The period of performance will be for a base year with four one-year options and an additional period of up to six months in accordance with FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.  We reserve the right to issue one contract for both services or two separate contracts.  The anticipated issuance date for the RFP is May 20, 2005, with proposals due by July 1, 2005.  The RFP will be posted on www.eps.gov under Department of Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision.  It will also be posted on the OTS’s web-site.  All responsible [dental and vision health care providers (not brokers)] offerors having an interest in providing these important services to OTS’s employees may submit both cost/price and technical proposals in accordance with the RFP.  Evaluation will be performed on a best value basis as stated in the RFP.  All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system (www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond intends to acquire Covers through the use of long-term contracts awarded against solicitation SP0412-05-R-2656.  This solicitation is comprised of Government identified groupings of NSNs consisting of 72 individual line items.  The Government will separately evaluate and award each group rather than evaluate and award on a per line item basis.  Assuming the Government receives one or more offers for each group, the Government will evaluate the offers on the basis of the Total Group Price (TGP).  The TGP is the sum of the individual line item prices for the total contract period.  The individual line item price is sum of the unit price multiplied by the anticipated demand quantity for each contract period.  The evaluated price will also include any other price evaluation factors identified elsewhere in the solicitation (e.g. first article costs).  It is anticipated that split awards will be made against this solicitation.  The resultant contracts will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The contracts will have a twenty four month base period and three twelve-month option periods for total maximum period of performance of 5 years if all options are exercised.  The NSNs in this solicitation all fall under FSC’s 1560 & 1620.  Once released (see issue date below) the solicitation will be found at http://www2.dscr.dla.mil/externalweb/UserWeb/FAGA/index.html and on the procurement gateway.  There are drawings associated with some of the NSNs covered by this acquisition.  In order to obtain access to drawings, offerors must be registered on the DSCR Technical Data Management Division website.  It is suggested that vendors who are not already registered access the following web-site to register prior to release of the solicitation http://www.dscr.dla.mil/tdmd/mb_index.asp.   The solicitation will be issued on 13 May 2005 and close on 13 June 2004.  Documents will not be available until the solicitation issue date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Agency, White Sands Missile Range, intends to conduct a full and open competition for the operation and maintenance of foreign ground weapon systems and foreign aviation equipment in support of the Threat Systems Management Offic e (TSMO), Huntsville, AL. The NAICS Code for the full and open competition will be 541330 with a size standard of $23M. The services involve operation and maintenance of foreign ground weapon systems, operation and maintenance of foreign aviation equipment , engineering and technical support as related to corrective maintenance, training support, test support, and marketing.  This will include permitting competition from companies that engage in the design, development or production of aerospace or other sys tems or major subsystems of a type normally developed, tested or evaluated utilizing TSMO assets/equipment. While Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues are a significant consideration, they may be mitigated with an acceptable mitigation plan. In  order for us to resolve any OCI issues as early as possible in the acquisition cycle, we have decided to initiate a process following the principles of FAR 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process and pre-qualify competitors.  Since ensuring the continued trust  of our customers is of paramount importance, we must understand the safeguards and mitigation strategies necessary to ensure any perceived or actual organizational conflict of interest is avoided, neutralized, or mitigated. We encourage every company that  expects to submit an offer as a prime contractor or as a member of a contractor teaming arrangement to review the OCI discussion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5 and 10 USC 2399 and determine the potential for an OCI.  If you dete rmine that there is the potential for an OCI, you should next analyze the situation and decide whether the potential OCI can be mitigated through a particular course of action as stipulated in a mitigation plan.  If so, such a mitigation plan should be dra fted and submitted for evaluation.  If you decide that no real or perceived conflict exists, please tell us the basis for your decision and we will tell you whether we agree.  We intend to evaluate your mitigation plan to assess its risk and content. A tho ughtful, comprehensive plan addressing in detail the elements listed on our webpage at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm is our expectation. Upon evaluation of your submission, we will advise you (solely from an OCI perspective) whether w e believe your company is a viable competitor.  We will publish a list of viable competitors and they will be invited to participate in this acquisition. The Government will treat all submissions as proprietary under 18 U.S.C. §1905 and protect the propose d information accordingly. Your submission must be received by 2:00 PM, MST on 23 May 2005.  Submission must be made electronically to roblesms@wsmr.army.mil and must be in a format that can be read by Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat.

<DESC>This announcement modifies the NOTICE OF SITE VISIT – Due to availability of the aircraft, change the date of the Site Visit from May 4, 2005 and May 5, 2005 to May 11, 2005 and May 12, 2005.  The site visit is scheduled to be at NOAA Aircraft Operations Center 7917 Hangar Loop Drive Hangar 5, MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa FL 33621.  All contractors interested in attending the site visit must provide their names, DOB, SSN, email contact information, Driver’s license number, expiration date and state in which it was issued to Margaret.a.rankin@noaa.gov, betty.jane.wilson@noaa.gov and Alan.s.goldstein@noaa.gov to obtain the necessary clearances for access to the site.  The requested information is required no later April 29, 2005.  ALL VISITORS MUST BE US CITIZENS for this visit.  Visitors will be notified on or about May 6, 2005 of the status update of the aircraft’s arrival to Mac Dill AFB.  Visitors will be required to have photo ID, vehicle registration or rental agreement and proof of insurance.  Access letters will be available at the Visitor’s reception center (VRC) located at Mac Dill AFB.  Visitors must allow for long wait times at the VRC as waiting times over one hour are common.  A suggestion would be to obtain the access letter/pass the night before.  Current VRC operating hours are from 6 am to midnight (subject to change).  Visitors are reminded to wear closed toes shoes during the site visit.  Visitors will be met at the street side of hangar 5 and will be escorted while in the hangar or on the ramp.  Visitors will be permitted to take pictures of any visible part of the aircraft but may NOT take any picture that includes the Air Force flight line, aircraft or facilities.  







The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.

The PRESS contract will be for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) requirements and will use Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procedures.

Correspondence may be sent by post to Mr. Dinwoody at the following address: James Dinwoody AFSAC/PKP 1822 Van Patton Dr. Bldg. 210 Front Wright Patterson, OH  45433-5337 NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of  shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE BUILDING MODERNIZATION PROJECT at the Mary E. Swtizer Building of the GS-11P-05-MKC-0036 

The synopsis posted March 31, 2005 and modified April 19, 2005 is modified to add the following information concerning distribution of plans and specifications.  The plan and specifications are going to issued electronically through secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).   FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.     In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.     The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.     You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.   You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.     At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:     (Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company?s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.     Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>D -- Development of a Common Biospecimen Coordination System and Informatics Infrastructure for NCI Prostate Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs)
<SOLNBR>N02-CO-51018-17
<RESPDATE>051105
<CONTACT>Robin Irving, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-8611, Fax (301) 480-0241, Email ri23j@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a contractor to develop a design plan and budget for system implementation of a common biospecimen coordination system and informatics infrastructure (Biospecimen Coordination System) for multiple NCI Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) in prostate cancer research. This system shall facilitate biospecimen and data sharing among scientific investigators located at different institutions by employing standardized approaches for collecting, processing, storing, annotating and distributing high-quality biospecimens. Initially, this system shall support the Inter-SPORE Prostate Biomarkers Study (IPBS), a validation study of prospective prostate cancer biomarkers. Ultimately, the purpose of this project is to serve as a pilot for the evolving National Biospecimen Network (NBN) by developing an infrastructure to annotate and integrate specimen banks, such as those of the SPOREs, to enhance the quality and availability of various biospecimens and associated data for the broader scientific community.

The Biospecimen Coordination System informatics infrastructure shall promote communication and the exchange of biospecimens and data between participating centers and shall be fully compatible with the NCI’s Cancer Bioinformatics Grid (caBIG) (http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/). Therefore, in addition to serving as a pilot for the NBN, the IPBS infrastructure shall provide the Prostate SPOREs with an integrated, scalable informatics system that may serve as a model for other biorepository networks. The Biospecimen Coordination System described here is not intended to supplant existing resources at the participating SPORE sites, and shall integrate with relevant clinical departments (e.g., surgery and pathology) without interrupting existing workflows. 

The major components of the Biospecimen Coordination System include: (1) Human subjects protection, privacy protection and informed consent processes; (2) Rigorous standard operating procedures (SOP’s) for biospecimen collection, processing, annotation, storage and dissemination; (3) Quality assurance/quality control; (4) Integration with associated clinical data, both retrospectively and prospectively; (5) Informatics system requirements; (6) Biospecimen and data access policies; (7) Biohazard considerations and packing, shipping and storage policies; (8) Intellectual property/Ongoing system oversight and maintenance; (9) Establishment of a common repository for biospecimens unused by the IPBS; and (10) Personnel management. 

Because the Biospecimen Coordination System is envisioned as an ongoing resource with broad applicability to the scientific community, the Contractor shall establish a common biospecimen repository of material not required for the IPBS. Access to this common biorepository will be overseen by an expert committee assembled by the NCI. Prostate SPORE programs may store some biospecimens locally; however, each participating SPORE program will ship a subset of samples (rigorously collected and annotated based on SOPs) to the common repository managed by the Contractor.

This Contract consists of two phases. Phase 1 (4 months) focuses on developing a recommended design plan and budget for system implementation. The Phase 1 design plan shall also describe at least two other viable options and alternatives (including budgets) for implementing the pilot system. Phase 2 (20 months) is the implementation of the plan as a pilot system for the Prostate SPOREs and will be contingent upon review and approval of the Phase 1 design plan and budget by an NCI-convened expert committee. The Contractor shall submit the Phase 1 design plan and alternatives with budgets within three (3) months of the Contract award. 

The expert review committee may accept the Phase 1 recommended design plan, reject the Phase 1 design plan, or suggest changes based on the options and alternatives stated in the design plan. Therefore, Phase 2 is an option to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. An important charge of the expert review committee will be to determine the appropriate human subject provisions for Phase 2 based on the Phase 1 design plan. The contractor shall incorporate all required human subjects requirements before Phase 2 implementation based on the recommendations of the expert review committee. Upon approval of the Phase 1 design plan, the Contractor shall complete system implementation (Phase 2) within twenty (20) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include the following Mandatory Qualification Criteria which must be met in order for an offeror’s proposal to be considered for award: detailed information on the Offeror’s contract(s)/project(s) similar in nature to the solicitation work scope to document at least two (2) consecutive years of experience of the Project Director and the Offeror company/institution in managing, running, and overseeing a multi-institutional human biorepository network within the past five years. Contract(s)/project(s) listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, and commercial concerns. The following information shall be submitted to document this experience: Name of contracting organization; Contract number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number); Contract type; Total contract value; Description of the requirement; Contracting Officer’s name and telephone number; Project Director’s name and telephone number; and Standard Industrial Code or NAICS code. 

The Government will employ a deviated data rights clause for this project. The RFP will provide draft language of what the final deviation may include.

This solicitation is anticipated to result in one (1) award to an offeror (including its qualified consultants and subcontractors) capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the Statement of Work. The contract type is a cost-reimbursement (completion) for a period of 4 months with one (1) option for twenty (20) months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512 with a size standard of $21,000,000. NOTE: THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS REQUIREMENT IS FULL AND OPEN TO ALL SOURCES, BOTH SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-51018-17 will be available on or about March 31, 2005 with receipt of proposals due 35 days after issuance (on/about May 4, 2005). The RFP will contain information relative to a pre-proposal conference that will be held prior to April 15, 2005. Given the anticipated short-turn around between the issuance of the RFP and the pre-proposal conference, potential offerors are encouraged to review the draft statement of work (SOW) that was used for the Sources Sought/Request for Information SS-NCI-ESS-2005 and begin to formulate questions concerning the SOW. For the most part, the draft SOW for SS-NCI-ESS-2005 is substantially the same as the SOW to be used for this RFP.  The RFP will contain specific instructions concerning the submission of your questions and the date/location/time for the pre-proposal conference.  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR PROPOSAL MUST BE COMPLIANT WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK CONTAINED IN THE RFP. The draft SOW is located on NCI’s website as specified below. The RFP will only be available electronically and may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute’s Research Contracts Branch (RCB) Home Page at http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/ Once at the RCB Home Page, select Current Request for Proposals. All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in the electronic RFP package. POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE RFP AND ANY AMENDMENTS. NCI plans to make an award on or before September 30, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN COMPLEX DISEASE. THE MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING A UNITED STATES NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY.  A SECOND MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING THREE INDIVIDUAL, DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE).  THIS WILL INVOLVE  RESEARCHING RELEVANT ISSUES AND MAKING A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH.  PREVIOUS TWIN STUDIES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF THIS TYPE OF FAMILY DESIGN IN ETIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.  THE USE OF TWINS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE STATISTICAL POWER OF A GENETIC STUDY BY EXPLOITING THE UNIQUE DEGREE OF SHARING (BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL) AMONG TWINS.  COMPARISON  OF CONCORDANCE RATES FOR A TRAIT OR DISEASE AMONG MONOZYGOTIC (MS) AND DIZGOTIC (DZ) TWINS ALLOW  FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THAT CONDITION IS DUE TO HEREDITARY SHARED OR NONSHARED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE MAJOR TASKS AS FOLLOWS: (1) PROVIDE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT POPULATION OF TWINS IN THE US AND STRATIFY THEM INTO DEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS BASED ON THEIR ZYGOSITY, AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, SES, URBAN LIVING CATEGORIES, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITHIN THE US, ETC.  THIS WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY SUB-POPULATIONS WITH CONSISTENTLY LOW RATES OF RESEARCH PARTICIPATION WHOM MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CONSIDERATIONS. (2) PROVIDE IN-DEPTH CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE U.S. THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TYPE 1 DIABETES, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, OR SYSTEMIS LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  AS PART OF THIS TASK INVESTIGATE AND DESCRIBE THE PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN EXISTING TWIN REGISTRIES AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN TWIN RESEARCH PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY REGISTRIES, ACADEMIC, OR OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  (3) EVALUATE THE ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING A NATIONAL AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DISCUSS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY (HIPAA) AND THE PRIVACY ACTS AND HOW HEY MIGHT AFFECT ESTABLISHING THESE REGISTRIES OR DISSEMINATING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE, AND HOW THESE ISSUES RELATE TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN, SUBJECTS WITH DIMINISHED CAPACITY, WOMEN, MINORITIES, ETC.  (4) ESTIMATE WHAT PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS DESCRIBED IN TASKS 1 AND 2 ABOVE WOULD LIKELY BE WILLING TO ENROL IN A TWIN REGISTRY AND PARTICIPATE IN REGISTRY SPONSORED RESEARCH PROGRAMS.  THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD RECOMMEND VARIOUS ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE RECRUITMENT OF THE GENERAL US TWIN POPULATION, AS WELL AS SPECIAL ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR SUBGROUPS WITH HISTORICALLY   LOW RECRUITMENT RATES (MINORITIES, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING, WOMEN, RURAL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, LOW SES GROUPS, ETC.)  (5) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  IF SUCH A NATIONAL REGISTRY IS NOT DEEMED FEASIBLE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL CONCEIVE, RESEARCH AND EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OF CREATING US TWIN RESOURCES FOR FUTURE STUDIES. (6) COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE TO ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING RESOURCES OF TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES.  BASED ON THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASK 2,3, AND 4, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING THREE NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRIES FOR TWIN AFFECTED WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, AND SLE.  (7) MEET AND DISCUSS WITH THE NIEHS PROJECT OFFICERS AND A PANEL OF EXPERTS THE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  ONCE TASK 1-6 ARE COMPLETED, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COMPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT LISTING AND DISCUSSING HOW THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASKS 1-4 AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NIEHS-SPONSORED PROGRAMS MIGHT AFFECT THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED AND THREE DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  (8) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING TWIN RESOURCES.  THIS SHOULD INCLUDE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES FOR WOMEN AND SUB-POPULATIONS WITH HISTORICALLY LOW RESEARCH  PARTICIPATION RATES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE REPRESENTATIVE PROPORTIONS OF MINORITY SUBGROUPS.  (9) OUTLINE METHODS REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE NATIONAL REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DM, MS, SLE AND/OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING AFFECTED TWIN RESOURCES.  FOR EACH CONDITION, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DEVISE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY BOTH INCIDENT AND PREVALENT CASES.  (10) ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL CURRENT AND PROJECTED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING A NATIONAL POPULATION-BASED TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE, INDIVIDUAL DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES, OR ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CREATING U.S. TWINS RESOURCES.  THESE ANALYSES SHALL INCLUDE THE COSTS OF OPERATING SUCH REGISTRIES ON A YEARLY BASIS FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS.  THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS.  THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 5,772 DIRECT LABOR HOURS MAY BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THIS  PROJECT.  THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION CODE (NAICS) IS 541710.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS  SET-ASIDE OF WHICH THE SIZE STANDARD IS 500 EMPLOYEES  OR  LESS.  THE  ANTICIPATED  RELEASE DATE OF THE RFP IS FEBRUARY 27, 2004 WITH PROPOSALS DUE BY APRIL 16, 2004.

<SUBJECT>72 -- FPI Sales in FSC Code 7210 - Updated
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RACS-12-2005
<CONTACT>Yvette Hairston-Mercer, Industrial Specialist, Phone 202-305-3862, Fax 202-305-7358, Email ymercer@central.unicor.gov
<DESC>Modification: The following paragraph is being changed as follows. Notwithstanding the fact that customers are no longer  required to purchase products from FPI as a result of the Board resolution waiving FPI’s mandatory source for products in which FPI has at least a 20 percent market share, there is absolutely no restriction or prohibition against the customers continuing to purchase from FPI, should they choose to do so of their own volition.  Thus, customers that currently rely on FPI to meet their product needs may continue to utilize FPI under the Board’s resolution.

On October 2, 2003, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding a decision by the FPI Board of Directors to waive FPI’s status as a mandatory source of supply for items within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7210 – Household Furnishings.  This notice clarifies the language in the original notice.  FPI will continue to produce items within FSC code 7210, however, all sales FPI obtains for those items will be through non-mandatory means.  This decision was effective on October 2, 2003.  This decision was the result of an earlier resolution by FPI’s Board to limit the application of FPI’s mandatory source to products for which FPI’s share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent.

Mandatory source is prescribed by law.  In the past, the Board has exercised its authority to administratively determine how the statute should be applied.  It is within the Board’s authority to determine the conditions under which waivers of FPI’s mandatory source are to be applied. The following guidance is being provided to facilitate the customer implementation of this action.

	&#8729;	For products where FPI has waived the application of mandatory source, the market share acquired by FPI without the benefit of the mandatory source is considered a reasonable share.

	&#8729;	For those FSCs where FPI’s mandatory source is waived, FPI must be given full visibility of the requirement and afforded a fair and equitable opportunity to submit an offer to meet the customer’s requirement, to include being provided by Federal agencies the same information and specifications (as are afforded to any private sector offeror).

	&#8729;	Such waiver is contingent upon FPI’s ability to submit an offer for these procurements.  Thus, consistent with the provisions of the Interim Rule Implementing  Sections 811/819 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2003 (Federal Register, November 14, 2003), such procurements must not be set aside for other programs, e.g., small business set-aside, nor may FPI be otherwise precluded from being able to submit an offer.

	&#8729;	Notwithstanding the fact that customers are no longer  required to purchase products from FPI as a result of the Board resolution waiving FPI’s mandatory source for products in which FPI has less than a 20 percent market share, there is absolutely no restriction or prohibition against the customers continuing to purchase from FPI, should they choose to do so of their own volition.  Thus, customers that currently rely on FPI to meet their product needs may continue to utilize FPI under the Board’s resolution.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention:  FPI Board of Directors.

Work to be Accomplished The Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region seeks a  contractor to prepare an environmental document that shall fulfill the legal requirements for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The EIS will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 40 CFR 1500-1508,  Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning the Council on Environmental Quality's CEQ's National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/40/40p3.htm and CEQ - Regulations for Implementing NEPA http://ceq.eh.doe.gov/nepa/regs/ceq/toc_ceq.htm ) and the Departmental Manual 516 DM 1-15.  Additionally, the information will be prepared to meet all Federal, Reclamation, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and applicable State of California environmental laws, regulations and policies including the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the National Historic Preservation Act.

Project Description  Reclamation seeks to improve public safety by modifying Folsom Dam and its appurtenant structures (Folsom Facilities) to mitigate potential safety concerns identified in previous and ongoing corrective action studies.  Analytical studies of Folsom Facilities have identified potential safety concerns related to structure stability under hydrologic, seismic and static loading conditions.  Current ongoing studies are being conducted to determine corrective action alternatives (modifications) to address loading conditions.   Possible modification alternatives are currently under consideration inclusive of the alternatives summarized below. Studies being conducted to determine preferred alternatives are ongoing and will be concurrent with this scope of work.  This scope of work shall be inclusive of all facilities with the understanding that many appurtenant structures have common designs and safety concerns and generalized modifications may be applied to these features. Some appurtenant structures have unique designs and safety concerns, which may require unique modification alternatives.  A brief generalized summary of the project is presented below, as well as, an outline of all alternatives currently under consideration.   Potential Alternatives A.  Potential structural alternatives to the Folsom Dam and appurtenant structures include, but are not limited to:   1)	Construct Auxiliary Spillway Option  2)	Dam Raise Option  3)	Reinforcement of Structures Option  B.  Folsom Dam and Embankment Hydrologic Alternatives include, but are not limited to:   1)	Embankment Raise Options 2)	Auxiliary Spillway on the Left Abutment Options C.  Additional potential alternative include, but are not limited to: 1)	Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam Seismic Alternatives  2)	Concrete Dam Seismic Options 3)	Folsom Dam and Embankment Seismic Alternatives 4)	Folsom Dam and Embankment Static Alternatives Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/GRC to post a Request for Information (RFI) and solicit responses from interested parties relative to the development of a future requirement for oil-free turbochargers.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  Information gathered by this synopsis will help in determining if a call for proposals for a future competitive procurement package will be initiated.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to: Kevin Radil, no later than May 13, 2005 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.	When responding to this notice, please reference “NNC05ZCH015L” and “Oil-Free Turbochargers.” Description: THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The government requests information from industry to assist in estimating the cost of designing, constructing and delivering six Oil-Free turbochargers to the U.S. Government and to submit comments on the draft requirements.  At this time, the Government requires Oil-Free turbochargers sized as direct replacements for the oil-lubricated version (Borg Warner S300) being used on Caterpillar’s I6, 7-Litre, C7 diesel engine that powers the U.S. Army Stryker and FMTV’s (Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles).  The turbocharger is rated at 357kw with an operating speed of 108krpm and a compressor air mass flow of .52 kg/s.  The turbochargers should utilize only foil air thrust and radial bearings as the support components for the rotating shaft.  Utilization of existing hardware from the lubricated version, such as the turbine, compressor and housing is expected and encouraged.  The turbocharger should be a self-sufficient unit that relies only on diesel exhaust gas to drive the turbine and bleed air from the compressor for bearing cooling if needed.  The turbocharger shall be instrumented with thermocouples to measure bearing and cooling air temperatures, vibration sensors for shock load measurements and proximity probes to measure shaft orbits.  Turbocharger orientation will initially be horizontal but may be tested in a vertical mode at a later date.  Before delivery, the manufacturer shall demonstrate each turbocharger to the government at speed and temperatures simulating a diesel engine environment (gas stand or engine test stand).  Once delivered, the government intends to distribute the turbochargers to various government and industrial financial contributors who will subject them to field trials to validate the technology and assess their performance.  Afterward the users of the Oil-Free turbochargers shall document the field trial tests by submitting a report to the government that outlines the test results.  The reports shall be made available to the manufacturer of the turbochargers for review. Responses can be made through verbal or written communication and should be submitted no later then May 13, 2005. Submittal Instructions: 1. Please send relevant literature and information to: Kevin Radil NASA-Glenn Research Center Attn: Kevin Radil M/S 23-2 21000 Brookpark Road Cleveland, OH 44135-3191 (216) 433-5047 E-mail address: Kevin.C.Radil@grc.nasa.gov 2. Such information shall be included in electronic files in either: Microsoft Word, PDF or Postscript (PDF is preferred) with your comments to the System Requirements and Design Concepts.   As part of your information package, please include company Technical Point(s) of Contact including address, telephone number and e-mail address. 3. At its discretion, NASA may request further discussions and/or clarification of the information submitted.	If agreeable to both parties, such discussions may take place via teleconferencing or on-site visit to NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio at the responder’s expense.  If they do occur, discussions will be constrained to a two hour time duration, and will consist of vendor presentations and subsequent discussions of the presented material only.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that will be initiated in the near future.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.

The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) in the Precision Engineering Division (PED) of the Manufacturing and Engineering Laboratory (MEL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland is the primary calibration laboratory for the United States.  As part of this effort, EMG has developed specialized software to implement its Measurement Assurance Program (MAP).  This software is an integrated set of programs that manages the complete calibration cycle, including customer information, data taking and analysis, report writing, statistical process control, and management of the master gauge system.  Currently there are versions for gauge blocks, thread wires, angle blocks and sphere diameter.  All of these will be merged into a single lab system.  There are also auxiliary programs to interface a number of instruments into this system as well as those of the M48 CMM and dilatometer.  

The current MAP system is in Hewlett Packard BASIC, and has been used and occasionally modified for over 20 years.  These changes need to be integrated into a single system, and to ensure future changes can be made and supported, EMG has decided to rewrite all of its systems in Visual Basic.  Because of some limitations in our instrument interfaces the software system National Instruments LabView software will be used for communicating to instruments.

In order to proceed to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy to accomplish the above, NIST seeks information on potential sources with experience and current expertise in some the following areas:

HP Basic
Visual Basic
SQL
National Instruments LabView software
Statistical Process Control

IF YOUR COMPANY HAS RECENT (IN THE PAST THREE YEARS) EXPERIENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN SCOPE TO WHAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW MAP SYSTEM, THEN PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION BY EMAIL TO JOSEPH.WIDDUP@NIST.GOV NO LATER THAN MAY 6, 2005:

1.  Description of each similar project completed by your company as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including as much of the following information as possible:

 (a) dollar amount of the contract;

 (b) brief description of the technical requirements of that project;

 (c) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.);

 (d) indication of how long the project took to complete from start to finish;

 (e) how many Contractor and, if applicable, subcontractor full time equivalents were required to complete the job; and

 (f) name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done.

2. Current socioeconomic status of your company as it relates to NAICS 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services (see NAICS table at http://www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html); also, whether your company is currently certified as an 8(a) company or a service-disabled veteran-owned company.

3. Indication of whether your company currently has its own GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract and whether your company currently can provide IT developmental services under that contract (include the contract number for that contract);

4.  Indication of whether your company has its own Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) and whether your company can provide IT developmental services under that contract (include the contract number for that contract);

5. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>DRMS is a primary level field activity of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Its mission is to provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with services for the disposal of material no longer needed for national defense, comply with legislative and regulatory requirements, protect the public good from dangerous defense items, and to pursue maximum value for tax dollars.  This mission includes responsibility for property reuse (including resale), hazardous property disposal, demilitarization, precious metals recovery and recycling program support.  In performing this mission, DRMS receives a wide variety of property in twenty-three (23) commodity groups involving hundreds of federal supply class (FSC) categories, which can be found at the following web site http://www.drms.dla.mil/asset/fsclist.html.  When DRMS receives property, a DRMS form 1348-1 is filled out by the owner of the property when it is turned in to DRMS.

DRMS has a requirement for contract support to assess the data accuracy of property received by DRMS field offices.  As part of the data accuracy testing, DRMS would like a contractor to evaluate the effectiveness of controls for assuring the accuracy of excess commodity inventory data, and the reliability of key data elements: condition codes, the stock number used (local stock number (LSN) versus national stock number (NSN), and the assigned demilitarization (demil) codes.  Additionally, the contractor will determine the impact of inaccurate data on property reutilization.  

This sources sought announcement is intended to solicit interest from commercial firms with the capability and expertise to provide this contract service.  DRMS is interested in determining whether this type of service can be provided by one firm for all of the property DRMS may receive, or whether this type of service may need to be broken out into separate contracts for various commodity classes.  If DRMS issues a solicitation for these services, it is anticipated that it will be initially for reviewing the accuracy at 10 field offices located in the continental United States.  Information on DRMS, including the types of property that may be received, can be found on the DRMS web site at www.drms.dla.mil.  

It is requested that interested firms provide information on their capabilities to perform this type of service for DRMS and what type of commodity classes their firm would be able to assess for accuracy.  Also include the average annual receipts of your firm over the last three years.  

Please provide this information to Mr. Darran G. Duncan at Darran.Duncan@dla.mil and Mr. Bernie Solovey at Bernie.solovey@dla.mil.  If you have any questions, Mr. Duncan is the primary POC.

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Space Environment Center (SEC) to continue to acquire space data acquisition and transmission services from the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire, England.  As part of a joint NOAA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and United States Air Force (USAF) program, NOAA paid for modifications of NASA’s ACE scientific spacecraft to have a continuous RTSW data broadcast capability.  On August 21, 1997 ACE was launched into a unique orbit, about one million miles from Earth, called L1, where there is a balance of forces between the Sun and the Earth.  From this vantage point, ACE would continuously monitor the Solar Wind by directly measuring the plasma, magnetic field, and low energy particles, and would broadcast the data in real time toward Earth.  For a brief three and one-half hour period each day NASA would download its stored science data and simultaneously the current RTSW data is sent to NOAA.  The data received from the special RTSW broadcast is intended for operational use by NOAA’s SEC and is made available to cooperating International Space Environment Services (ISES) Centers throughout the world.  The data are used for generating real time forecasts and warnings of impending solar storms that will produce large geomagnetic disturbances at Earth.  In order to receive the RTSW data continuously at SEC at least three dedicated ground stations distributed equally around the Earth are required.  (As seen from the ground, ACE appears to circle the Sun, thus you can only track it at a given station during daylight hours.)  The Communication Research Laboratory (CRL) located in Tokyo, Japan, has installed an 11 meter dish ground station which is dedicated to tracking ACE.  However, the European sector was not well covered and had an unacceptable large tracking gap.  In the Summer of 1997, after making inquires to the United Kingdom (UK) and European space communities, SEC found that a ground station located at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK was not being used.  RAL has provided its 12 meter dish ground station available for ACE RTSW data acquisition.  This tracking network has grown with the addition of the NOAA tracking station (Wallops Command and Data Acquisition, Wallops Island, VA, and backup tracking by Indian Scientific Research Organization in India.  These additional stations have been built around the existing two dedicated stations, RAL and CRL.  The present international ground tracking network can now meet the operational requirement of at least 96% coverage per day with no gap longer than 15 minutes.   The Contractor shall be located in Western Europe or in the United Kingdom and shall provide data from the NASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft in the Real Time Solar Wind (RTSW) format to the NOAA/SEC in Boulder, CO, via the Internet.  The Contractor shall operate its existing 12m satellite ground station to receive the S band 996sps RTSW Telemetry signal from the NASA ACE spacecraft located one million miles from the Earth whenever the spacecraft is visible from the site, is transmitting data in RTSW format, and the data is not scheduled to be acquired at any other ground station.  The Contractor shall monitor the operation of the facility continuously during times of scheduled operation and be able to respond to unexpected signal loss or communication problems within 15 minutes of occurrence.  During those scheduled times, the Contractor shall provide NOAA/SEC with a guaranteed telephone point of contact with a Contractor staff member for the SEC to report problems observed from the SEC.  On weekends and national holidays the Contractor shall operate the ground station on a best effort basis by providing a guaranteed telephone point-of-contact for NOAA/SEC to reach a member of the Contractor staff when problems are observed from the SEC.  The Contractor will attempt to correct the problem on a best-effort basis.  The Contractor shall provide the ACE RTSW operational ground station network by email with projected schedules for the operation of the ground facility at least 48 hours in advance.  The Contractor shall notify the ground station network as far in advance as possible when scheduled maintenance down-time cannot be carried outside of scheduled operational time.  The Contractor shall notify the SEC as soon as it is known whenever unscheduled down-time due to equipment failure or any other problem occurs to permit possible rescheduling of other stations.  The Contractor shall maintain the ground station S Band receiver performance with a target G/T of greater than 26dB/K and provide the NOAA/SEC telemetry decoder and communications system with a 1 V pk-pk PM demodulator output from the ACE RTSW telemetry signal.  The Contractor shall maintain the antenna pointing loss of less than 1dB.  The Contractor shall provide physical space and conditioned electrical power for the installation of NOAA provided telemetry decoding and communication equipment implemented in software on a general purpose computer.  The Contractor shall provide a standard UTP computer network connection for the NOAA/SEC equipment.  This shall be a TCP/IP network and shall be capable of providing continuous TCP and UDP connectivity to the NOAA/SEC network via the public Internet at speeds of greater than or equal to 1 Mbps.  This contract is proposed for a base period and three one-year option periods.  This is not a formal notice of a solicitation.    See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>D -- Performance Decision on Streamlined Public-Private Competition for Information Technology Technical Services by the Administration Office, Office of Management and Budget
<DESC>This notice constitutes OMB’s formal announcement of a performance decision on its streamlined public-private competition involving information technology (IT) technical services performed by its Administration Office (AO).  Through competition, OMB determined that it is more cost-effective to continue having these services performed by government personnel.

The activities studied include desktop and network printer services, server support, and other technical services to assist OMB’s IT manager.  These activities fall within function code W826 (systems design, development and programming services) on OMB’s Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act inventory.  The manpower currently used to provide these activities is approximately 1.4 FTEs. The work is performed by employees at the GS-14 grade level in the 2210 Computer Specialist job series.

The competition was announced in FedBizOpps on January 31, 2005.  Following this announcement, and in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, the cost of performance with government personnel was compared to the cost of performance by the private sector to determine which sector is more cost-effective.  The cost of government performance was evaluated based on the AO’s current organizational structure.  The cost of private sector performance was determined based on market research conducted by the Federal Technology Service of the General Services Administration on OMB’s behalf.  The market research was based on a review of pricelists published by six different IT contractors (three small businesses and three large businesses) who offer support services through GSA’s Multiple Award Schedules Program.  The highest and lowest estimates were dropped to determine a composite estimate for private sector performance.

The cost of continued in-house performance was estimated to be about $1.1 million over a five-year period.  The cost of private sector performance over the same performance period was estimated to be around $1.5 million.  Costs were determined using COMPARE, the software prescribed by the Circular for calculating the cost of government and private sector performance in accordance with the Circular’s costing procedures.  Based on this analysis, OMB determined that the competed work should continue to be performed by federal employees.

Costs have been documented on the streamlined competition form prescribed by the Circular.  The form is attached to this notice.

OMB’s Competitive Sourcing Official is Mr. Robert A. Burton.  The Agency Tender Official is Ms. Lauren Wright.  The Contracting Officer is Ms. Lesa Scott, FTS.  Questions should be directed to the point of contact.

<SUBJECT>D -- Decennial Applicant, Personnel and Payroll System (DAPPS)
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) intends to enter into sole source  negotiations with PeopleSoft/Oracle to increase the user base from 6000 to approximately 78,000 under a perpetual software license already owned by USCB for its Decennial Applicant, Personnel and Payroll System (DAPPS).  This purchase only covers the maintenance costs (software releases, tax updates and documentation) associated with the increased user base.  Based on our market research, we have determined that the Government would incur a substantial duplication of costs to develop this application using another vendor solution.  Our market research determined no other COTS product could meet the need of the USCB without extensive customization and development costs.  The DAPPS system consists of several high-level requirements that can be summarized as follows: The system must comply with statutory and regulatory requirements for recruitment (applicant processing), personnel (hiring), time and attendance and payroll meeting Title 5, United States Code (5 USC) and other relevant sections of law, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR) and other relevant regulatory requirements, Title 6, of the US Code of Federal Regulations and the GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies regarding pay, leave, and allowances, OPM Guide to Processing personnel Actions, OPM Guide to Personnel Data Standards, OPM Federal Work Force Reporting Systems Manual, Executive Orders, Public Laws, and Federal overtime, compensatory time, and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime calculations. The DAPPS application must have Recruitment, Human Resources, Time and Attendance and Payroll components integrated into one seamless application.  The system must provide all tax updates for all taxing authorities of the United States and Puerto Rico.  This system must present accounting data and financial information through the creation of cost information from the Employee Payment function. This function must also provide production information to managers/users, financial data to Federal and state/local taxing authorities and output to the USCB Core Financial System. The DAPPS system must provide a means to electronically-capture applicant biographical data, testing results, language capabilities, and other employment-related criteria will be submitted to the OPM and FBI for suitability/clearance checks. The system must be capable of interfacing with multiple systems including (but not limited to) Workman’s Compensation, Unemployment Compensation, U.S. Treasury, General Ledger, National Registry of Bank Routing Numbers, Social Security Administration, and Bureau of Labor Statistics. The system must produce numerous reports supporting recruiting, human resources, time and labor and payroll operations. The system must meet and pass Federal FISMA Certification and Accreditation criteria, including all relevant Department of Commerce and U.S. Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies, and the Federal security standards and regulations for data being stored or transmitted according to NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems" and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 "Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories."  Additional security standards and regulations that must be complied with include NIST Special Publication 800-53 for security controls, NIST SP 800-18 for security plans, NIST SP 800-18 for electronic authorization, NIST SP 800-47 for interconnecting information technology systems, as well as the Clinger Cohen Act of 1966, and OMB Circulars A-11, A-94 and A-130. The database supporting the current DAPPS application is Oracle 9.2.05, with operating system Unix Tru64 5.1.b. The software must be programmable to meet requirements for processing Decennial Census forms and business practices.

It has taken four years to develop the current PeopleSoft solution and considering the upcoming mission-critical 2006 Census Test, 2008 Dress Rehearsal and the 2010 Decennial Census. It would not be feasible to develop a new product.  Further, the costs associated would not be competitive with the current system.  While this is not a request for competitive proposals, responses received within 15 days from the posting of this notice will be reviewed and evaluated for technical merit.     No telephone requests will be accepted.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of the statements received in response to this notice, however the statements will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the USCB.  If no responses are received, a sole source contract with PeopleSoft/Oracle will be pursued without further notice.

8.    STATEMENT OF WORK

A.	Background: 

Title II of the Agricultural Trade and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480), as amended, appropriates resources intended to combat hunger and malnutrition through support to activities that raise the level of availability, access, and utilization of food in recipient countries.  Title II programs are the responsibility of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance, the Office of Food for Peace (DCHA/FFP) in USAID.  The Office is comprised of three divisions; Emergency Programs (FFP/EP), Non-emergency or Development Programs (FFP/DP), and Programs Operations (FFP/POD). Under the guidance of the Office Director and his Deputy, DCHA/FFP manages the largest budget in USAID (over $1.8 billion in FY 2004) of this amount, FFP/EP is responsible for the management and accounting for over fifty per cent of overall Title II resources.  

The incumbent Food for Peace Officer will assume responsibility for approximately 3-5 activities in 1-2 countries with a resource budget of $20 million annually.  These funds are being expended in realization of DCHA/FFP’s First Strategic Objective (SO#1); namely critical food needs of targeted groups met. Title II emergency activities are normally implemented by eligible organizations, namely private voluntary and cooperative development organizations (PVOs/CDOs) and the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP), termed cooperating sponsors (CSs), under the mandate of Title II of the Agricultural Trade and Development Act of 1954 (as amended).  In rare cases, emergency food aid activities are implemented on a Government-to-Government basis.  USAID’s Strategy, Food Security Policy Paper promulgated in February 1995 and Emergency Title II proposal preparation guidelines serve as programmatic guidance for CSs. 

Specifically, the incumbent must have demonstrated ability to perform analytical and evaluative work associated with management of emergency program activities.  The necessary analytical skills require the ability to prepare and process approval documentation, activity tracking and briefing materials, write reports, letters, and other documents.   The work requires knowledge and understanding of pertinent program and budget principles in order to establish, review, and administer non-emergency development activities. 

The work requires a high degree of initiative and judgment to assure effective implementation of the purposes of P.L 480.  The incumbent must have the ability to interact with a broad range of internal and external partners and clients and function successfully as a member of a multi-functional team. The incumbent must also have demonstrated initiative and ability to manage competing work priorities and work independently when required.

The incumbent of this position will carry out the following functions and specific duties:

Further, the incumbent will also analyze budgets and allocate resources for complex emergency food assistance programs working in the areas of Therapeutic and Supplementary Feeding, Food-for-Work, Refugee and Internally Displaced Feeding, and general relief, where appropriate, to meet program objectives.  

•	The incumbent will ensure that emergency proposal activities are consistent with Agency Food Security Policy guidance, Strategic Objective One’s (SO#1) intermediate results packages, Regulation 11 and DCHA/FFP budgetary and financial guidelines, and support the total U.S. emergency response effort in the recipient country.  The incumbent will analyze results reports, resource requests, and recommend approving or not approving CS activities.

•	The incumbent will work to build the capacity of cooperating sponsors and others to plan, manage, and evaluate Title II emergency food aid programs utilizing Title II food commodities.  

•	The incumbent will establish and maintain effective collaboration and productive working relationships with the staff of CSs proposing and implementing Title II activities, international organizations, USAID field Missions, other donors, USDA, and U.S. interest groups, effectively interpreting and communicating program guidance.

•	In conjunction with the team leader, the incumbent must analyze U.S. and international agricultural markets and interests, and interpret Bellmon and Usual Marketing Requirement analyses to correctly advise cooperating sponsors, USAID, USDA, and U.S. interest groups on the appropriate U.S. commodities and tonnage for individual and country activities.  

•	The incumbent will provide support to the SO#1 team leaders for central functions such a budgeting, planning and evaluation.

•	The incumbent will ensure that Title II resources are properly and efficiently programmed to derive the greatest benefit and recover to the maximum extent the costs to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the March 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Joan Mathys, Washington, DC  20008 to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under an existing purchase order number 467-MZ-302338.  The contractor will continue to provide a range of copyright and permissions services to the History of Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Library of Medicine, including obtaining permissions from rights holders, preparing required documents for securing permissions, and negotiating license fees and agreements for multimedia material used in the library's exhibition program and Web sites.  Joan Mathys has successfully negotiated copyright and licensing agreements for the use of materials by HMD's Exhibition Program and Prints and Photographs Division, as well as other areas of the Library.  In doing this work, she has established contacts with rights holders and has customized forms for seeking and tracking permissions for a variety of projects.  Ms. Mathys experience working with international copyright issues and fees has been and will continue to be an asset to the Library.  She did considerable work, for example, on the "Strange Hells Within the Minds War Made: War and Trauma in the 20th Century" exhibit, which featured several objects from outside of the United States.  She has over twelve years of experience, including four working as a contractor with NLM, conducting picture and film research and clearing rights for imagery for major museum exhibitions, Web sites, books, documentaries, and other multimedia projects.  The program area has determined that the project requirement is significantly more complex than originally anticipated.  Consequently, additional funds, time and effort are needed in order for the contractor to continue this ongoing work.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time and government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate the following criteria for award.  Criterion A:  (40 points) Vendor must have 5 years of successful experience determining copyright status, identifying copyright holders, and securing permissions and rights for reproductions (including photographs, film, documents, and graphics) for use in exhibits, online displays, and printed material.  Criterion B:  (40 points) Vendor must have 5 years of successful experience maintaining databases of contact information for tracking permission sources for materials used on exhibits, online displays, and printed material, and monitoring the expiration of all permissions.  Experience should include communication with registrars, collections managers, curators, private collectors, publication firms, photo stock houses, and other sources for permissions.  Criterion C: (20 points) Vendor must have experience working on at least two (2) major exhibitions researching and tracking contact information for potential lenders of materials for display.  This requirement is for a base year with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  ** The Statement of Work (SOW) of this requirement is immediately followed below **.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The FAR provisions and clauses sited herein are incorporated by reference into this solicitation.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-5017. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-3 dated 4/11/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 1 (one) lot of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items; FAR52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price. By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall have posted their FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items at website http://orca.bpn.gov.

Questions 22 Apr 05

1)  The budget seems to be $50-$60K and I am unclear as to whether or not the trash cans, squeegee, and the fencing with access gates needs to be included in the budget price?

The budget includes all tear down and clean up.  We will not have huge trash cans in the area.  Not sure what the need for squeegee’s are.  The company will have to take the current fence off (or a portion of it) in order to get the equipment in and set up.  They will be responsible for putting the fence back on as well. 

 
2)  The dimensions are listed as "two end-to-end tennis courts".  Would you have the exact dimensions because even "official" sized tennis courts vary in size.  Our recommended design may change even if there are only a few feet difference in pad dimensions.

The dimensions are 100 ft long by 45 ft wide

 
3)  Do you have a design that you currently like or a list of ramps that you would like to see in the design?

  We do have a design that we like – we can show it on the site visit. 

 
4)  We will give a design and quote for the requested specification. We also want to know if we can submit another quote for a different option.
 
   We would like to see a quote for all designs, and we will accept different options as long as minimum requirements are met.

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.  The Contractor’s visit shall consist of approximately 10-14 days in Afghanistan.  The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s);

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

According to the World Bank, the health status of Afghans is among the worst in the world, with infant mortality rates of 165 per 1,000 births and maternal mortality rates of 1,600 per 100,000 live births.  Communicable diseases such as malaria, measles, and tuberculosis are prevalent and contribute to a life expectancy at birth of only 43 years.  A survey of existing health facilities showed that most Afghans do not have access to basic medical services.  Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide the bulk of health services, with 80% of health facilities operated or supported by NGOs.

In order to address this urgent problem, the Government of Afghanistan (GOA) has developed a Basic Package of Health Services, including maternal and newborn health, child health and immunization, public nutrition, and communicable disease control.  The GOA plans to deliver the Basic Package to 90% of the population by 2010.  By contracting with NGOs and private sector providers and increasing funding to government-run service providers, the GOA plans to achieve this goal.  

The World Bank is helping to fund the expansion of healthcare services with $60 million in grant and loan financing.  USAID is also working to improve the healthcare infrastructure by constructing and rehabilitating up to 400 health facilities and to improve vaccination rates through a national immunization program for measles and polio.

The GOA is also looking at a number of other projects to improve the provision of health servcies in Afghanistan.  The Ministry of Public Health of the GOA has requested USTDA-funded feasibility studies on the following healthcare sector projects:
·	Inventory Control Systems
·	Health Facilities Standards and Accreditation
·	Mental Health Delivery and Management
·	Drug Rehabilitation
·	Nutrition
·	Biomedical Engineering and Medical Equipment Maintenance
·	Capacity Building for the Ministry of Public Health Construction Department

The DM consultant would need to travel to Afghanistan in order to properly assess which, if any, of the above projects meet USTDA criteria.  As part of its review process, the DM would contact other U.S. Government agencies, such as USAID, and international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a Definitional Mission (DM) team to travel to Guatemala to investigate energy security and natural resources regulatory reform projects, for potential USTDA funding.  The DM will provide technical assistance to Guatemala’s Ministry of Environment and Mining (MEM) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) in two programs: 1) increasing trade capacity by developing the regulatory and investment environment for mineral and hydrocarbon resource development, and 2) information technology and regulatory reforms for reducing energy theft and smuggling.  Overall, the resulting technical assistance recommendations are designed to improve the business climate for domestic and foreign investments in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors within the CAFTA framework.

The Definitional Mission is focused on opening the investment climate for developing Guatemala’s mineral and hydrocarbon markets.  Guatemala has large, yet undeveloped metallic and non-metallic resources, not to mention being the only Central American country that has a significant reserve of hydrocarbon fuels.  The development of these two sectors represents a great opportunity for economic growth in Guatemala, and a significant opportunity for foreign investment and trade.  The technical assistance will help the capacity within the government of Guatemala regulate the natural resource development industry and provide ongoing oversight of existing extractive operations.

The DM shall specifically investigate two separate (yet related) activities:

Natural Resource Regulatory Reform: Conduct a fact-finding investigation and perform technical review of a Dorey & Associates, LLC proposal on behalf of MEM for regulatory reforms and institutional development within the Guatemalan mining and hydrocarbon sector.  The proposed deliverables of this project would include recommendations for new regulatory reforms in the mining and hydrocarbon sector, new permitting documents and procedures, and training seminars/workshops to increase the institutional capacity of the MEM and MARN to ensure effective management of increased investment in the sectors.  The details of each of these proposed outcomes/deliverables is described in greater detail in the MEM proposal, which will be provided to the winning bidder.

Energy Security: Evaluate a request from the MEM and the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala to provide technical assistance to assist Guatemala in decreasing the negative impacts of current fuel smuggling and alteration.  In order to realize new commercial and investments flows, along with new conditions created by commercial instruments, there is a need to strengthen the capability of public institutions responsible for policy, regulation, oversight and compliance, to ensure that counter-competitive practices, disrespect towards property and tax evasion caused by smuggling and fuel alteration are eliminated.  The desired outcomes of this project include new legislation to regulate the operation of the hydrocarbon sector and the development of increased capabilities and tools within the MEM to monitor the quality and quantity of commercial fuels in the country.  These tools would include a variety of training and information technology solutions to better track and control fuel resources in the country.  It is also important to note that this activity will not be supporting any police or military activity, but rather a list of technological solutions to develop a better management and regulation of this important sector.
