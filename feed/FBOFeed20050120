<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement to assist CDC in its evaluation of research applicantís responses to peer review assessments which were submitted under CDC program announcement 04003.  CDC supports 33 Prevention Research Centers associated with schools of public health, medicine, or osteopathy throughout the country.  Each center conducts at least one core research project with an underserved population that has a disproportionately large burden of disease and disability.  The following evaluation is required by March 15, 2005:  1.  A report on each applicantís response to the summary statement weaknesses; 2. A recommendation report about the summary statement weaknesses that can be shared with CDC and applicant staff; and 3. A recommendation report concerning each applicantís first-year work plan.  Contractor will also participate in telephone conferences and in-person meetings with CDC staff as needed.  A copy of the Statement of Work will be provided, if requested.  Performance will be at the contractorís facility.  The CDC is announcing its intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Battelle Memorial Institutes (BMI), Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation (CPHRE), Seattle, WA, to provide support of our review efforts of applications.  BMI Scientists have significant past experience with community-based public health program assessments, chronic disease prevention program evaluations and with various stakeholders, coalitions and partnerships related to CDC sponsored prevention research..  Because the CDC needs someone who can immediately respond to the critical performance requirements, and being a small effort, we believe the time and cost involved to bring another organization up to speed would not result in cost savings to the government.  This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; a request for quotation is not available.  Responsible organizations that feel they have the expertise to perform this work should submit a Capabilities Statement that provides a list of any past experience and publications relating to public health.  Responses should be submitted to Kim Groves at the above address and please reference 000HCL31-2005-18471 on your request.  The agency will consider all response(s) to this announcement in determining whether or no to compete this requirement.  Respondents would need to demonstrate 10-14 years of experience in public health disciplines and program assessment and evaluations and an understanding of CDC Program Announcement 04003 requirements.   Responses must be received within fifteen days after posting of this notice.  If the agency determines to compete this requirement, any RFQ will be posted at this FBO site, and a no subsequent presolicitation notice will  be issued.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Completion time is 715 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the four state region  consisting of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project ñ defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (3) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (4) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14 and miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stairway tower upgrades on floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 13 and 14 initially will be vacant; floors 11 and 12 will be vacated when the tenants from those floors move to 13 and 14.  Base Bid contract work includes demolition, asbestos and lead paint abatement; tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; building signage/graphics; new above ceiling HVAC; new lighting; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; new power distribution and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Option Bid work includes tenant improvements; meeting certification standards to qualify for LEED certification; stairway egress and pressurization infrastructure improvements from floors 11-18; and Building Automation System work.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the ìtrade-off processî in selecting the prime contractor.  The ìtrade-off processî is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and an optional in-person interview.  For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages.  Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about 01-24-05.  The RFTP will consist of technical evaluations to establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  Offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Pricing, a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements. Offerors whose technical evaluations do not meet minimum requirements will be notified by phone or letter that they will not be allowed to submit a price proposal. Offerors whose technical evaluations are not in the competitive range will also be so notified; however their price proposals will still be received and evaluated. Pricing Packages will be issued on or about April 11, 2005.  Initial Price proposals will be received in this office on or about May 20, 2005. Offerors should submit Stage Two price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposalís acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A request for final price proposals will be issued on or about May  29, 2005.  The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are approximately equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous. As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.  

THIS IS THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  The Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP), to be issued on or about 1/24/05, will include a general scope of work, completed Design Development level drawings and outline specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.

<SOLNBR>HSHQPA-04-X-00344
<RESPDATE>102504
<CONTACT>Charlotte Rupprecht, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5856, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Charlotte.Rupprecht@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in projects offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and development of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperatives agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

The emergency responder community has a need to acquire, synthesize, communicate and share critical information. These abilities are key elements in an effective response to
any emergency situation. This need has become more critical as the emergency responder community prepares to employ more coordinated responses to emergency situations and
new terrorist threats facing our nation. It is crucial to ensure that all information flowing into and out of the focal point of incident command is managed properly to ensure optimal use in supporting command and control and decision support.
This BAA seeks proposals to develop an innovative new architecture to support the information management and sharing requirements of the emergency responder community. After the completion of these studies, HSARPA anticipates competing and
funding a follow-on program to develop and field test technologies and systems which are found to be most advantageous during the architecture study phase.

The ability to manage personnel, direct equipment, and seamlessly communicate, gather, store, redistribute, and secure any mission critical information needed by incident
commanders and emergency responders during an emergency situation defines Unified Incident Command & Decision Support (UICDS). At present, the emergency responder community, composed of law enforcement, fire departments, emergency medical teams,
chemical weapons response teams, radiation and nuclear specialist, etc. have had limited success in the area of coordinated response due to inadequate, insecure, and incompatible training tools and information technologies. The full capabilities of information management technologies should be brought to bear on behalf of the emergency responder community in the form of a system that allows incident commanders and emergency responders to manage the flow of data, voice, and video information in addition to other forms of information. The very nature of emergency situations and the
complexity and volume of information flowing into and out of incident command positions demand a more integrated information management architecture. UICDS systems based on this highly interconnected and integrated architecture should meet the
needs of the entire emergency responder community and its design should allow for integration, when needed, between local, state, and federal information management,situation awareness and C4ISR systems. The integration of individual local, state, and/or
federal information management systems should create an interconnected, information sharing ënetwork of networksí whose overall capabilities are greater than the sum of its
individual parts.

The research, development, and launch of a UICDS information management system is crucial to the future operations of incident commanders and emergency responders. The goal of this BAA is to harness innovative ideas in an effort to create an information management and sharing architecture specifically designed to meet the needs of incident commanders and emergency responders throughout the nation and realize a robust, fully
functional UICDS information management system to enhance the safety and effectiveness of this nationís emergency responder community.

<DESC>GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION This is a pre-solicitation notice/synopsis to be issued as a request for proposal of a Government requirement.

The proposed procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business Administration (SBA) Certified 8a Small Business Companies in the State of Alaska only and will be conducted using source selection procedures.  The award will be based on the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  The importance and weighting of the non-price and price factors has yet to be determined by the Source Selection Authority.  However, potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the Government since they are subject to change.  An example of non-price evaluation factors are as follows: EVALUATION FACTORS:  PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT TEAM; EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE OF THE PROJECT TEAM; PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE KEY PERSONNEL; EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE OF THE KEY PERSONNEL; PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PROCEDURES OF THE FIRM.   OPTIONS:  The Government will evaluate price proposals for award purposes (inclusive of  options) by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement(s) to determine the overall evaluated price.  The estimated range of this project is $1,000,000 - $3,000,000.   The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Government system prior to award to be eligible for a Government contract - the CCR link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete, correct and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the Contracting Officer is ready to award the contract, the Contracting Officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered  in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror".  Offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>Please download complete (DRAFT) BAA.  Synopsis is as follows:

The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS), in conjunction with the DOD Office of Force Transformation (OFT), is requesting proposals (technical and cost/business) in response to this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  The primary objective of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate modular bus standards, interfaces, and processes to advance Operationally Responsive Space modular bus capabilities in order to meet rapidly evolving and unanticipated tactical military needs.  This requires that useable, tactically relevant space system performance be delivered much faster and at lower cost.  This adaptable, low-cost modular bus enables the tactical warfighter to rapidly deploy tactical satellites as low-cost consumables to fill critical sensing requirements.  These tactical satellites become additional sensor nodes within a tiered network of tactical and national sensor systems comprised of ground, air, and space assets.  The goal is to move toward an  adaptable modular bus development process that leverages plug-and-play standards and interfaces and incorporates the latest bus component technologies, supports multiple payloads and orbital mission profiles, and has minimal non-recurring engineering for successive satellite builds.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Eglin AFB, FL intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) to ANZUS, Inc., San Diego, CA to incorporate Weapon Data Link Network (WDLN) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) developed J and K series messages into existing Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Modernization Programís Close Air Support System (CASS) mission software.  The CASS mission software, developed under the TACP Modernization Program, includes ANZUS, Inc. proprietary components that will require modification under this effort.  The WDLN ACTD TACP CASS software modification effort will include (1) adding WDLN ACTD Interface Control Document (ICD) defined, new and/or modified, J and K series message capability to existing TACP mission software (ROSETTA); (2) graphically display target tracks and weapon information included in the WDLN ACTD ICD messages on Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Moving Map Tactical Information Display System (JMMTIDS); and (3) participate in two planned flight test demonstrations at Eglin AFB, FL.   The goal is to demonstrate the utility of WDLN ACTD J and K series messages by having a TACP transmit target updates to surrogate weapons in flight and for the TACP to receive and display status and bomb impact assessment information transmitted by the surrogate weapons.  The deliverables of the contract will be modified software and supporting training documentation.  Software may be provided in incremental releases to meet flight demonstration timelines. The software will be compatible with PRC-117F radios, JTIDS 2M and MIDS LVT 1 and 3 terminals, and Air Defense Systems Integrator and Improved Multi-Tadil Translation and Display System Link-16 hosts over various interfaces, such as MIL-STD 1553 data bus message set, Joint Range Extension Application Protocols (A/B/C), and others as appropriate.  To support planned flight demonstrations, an initial software release is required by 15 April 2005 with a subsequent release required in September 2005.  The modified software will then be validated by the 46 Test Squadron and Air Combat Command TACP Modernization Office (ACC/DRR/JAGO-TACP).  The period of performance will not exceed 12 months with a dollar value of less than $400K.  For technical information contact Kevin Sura, AAC/XRS 850-883-3256.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Bill Powell, Purchasing Specialist, Phone (703) 526-2764, Fax (703) 526-2747, Email bpowell1@email.usps.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification of construction contractors. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify construction contractors on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified contractors by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested construction contractors must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: CONSTRUCTION ONLY(3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 40 million, $40 to 100 million, $100 million and above. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified construction contractors in each of the defined geographical areas. 

The Postal Service will select the most qualified construction contractors utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Construction contractors that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.  A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a construction contractor and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million.

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR and completion or ongoing of one (1) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects over $100 million. 

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution: For projects over $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution or other projects of similar or greater complexity - New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the construction contractor are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.


Prequalified construction contractors will be automatically sent a notice for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. A solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at itsí sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Contractors shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firmís prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness. 

A preproposal meeting will be held at 1:00 PM on February 22, 2005 at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.
 
Qualification packages are available now and may be obtained by email request to Bill Powell at bill.powell@usps.gov or Tim Bonsall at tbonsall@email.usps.gov or written request to either at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840. You also may FAX your request to either at 703-526-2747. Qualification Statements are due March 15, 2005 by 3:00 P.M. EST. The completed statements should be delivered via one of the many services provided by the Postal Service or hand delivered to Bill Powell, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840. Qualification Statements will not be maintained or returned.  Contractors will not be reimbursed for any expense(s) incurred in developing their Statement

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide clarification of the following points related to the original BAA:  

1) Provide a strategy and architectural framework for interoperability with existing legacy communications (e.g. dispatch) and information management systems (e.g.
GIS) in current use in incident command and emergency management. Include support of commonly used and accepted standards as well as systems.
2) The UICDS architecture has both information management and communications aspects. A proposal should address both aspects.
3) Any anticipated restrictions on supplied or utilized intellectual property should be stated. The Government expects that a UICDS architecture will be open and nonproprietary.
4) In addressing collaboration in a UICDS architecture, issues of information/data discovery, invitation, access control and multi-level security must be addressed.
5) HSARPA provides a teaming portal via www.hsarpabaa.com that enables teams to be formed. Teams looking for complementary partnerships should use this portal.
6) Organizations/teams should contain subject matter experts in incident command and emergency management as well as information management and communications.
7) Proposals must address satisfaction of the NIMS requirements. The focus should be on ICS (Incident Command System) and MACS (Multiagency Coordination System) and on communications and information management. Cognizance should be taken of other NIMS requirements.

GENERAL
     This Section includes surface preparation, field cleaning and sealing of exposed exterior building surfaces.  

INTRODUCTION
Many of the problems of brick masonry, brought to the attention of the Brick Institute of America over the past years, have resulted from improper cleaning methods. Some walls have been irreparably damaged as a result of a lack of attention to cleaning details and procedures.
Cleaning failures generally fall into one of three categories: 
1. Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of the cleaning solution and may result in "mortar smear", "white scum", or the development of efflorescence or "green stain". Saturation of the surface prior to cleaning reduces the absorption rate, permitting the cleaning solution to stay on the surface rather than be absorbed.
2. Failure to properly use chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid solutions can etch or wash out cementitious materials from the mortar joints. They have a tendency to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently termed "acid burn" and can also promote the development of "green" and "brown" stains. 
3. Failure to protect windows, doors, and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions, have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials, such as limestone and cast stone.
Before the actual cleaning of a project begins, all cleaning procedures and solutions should be applied to a sample test area of approximately 20 sq. ft. (1.9 m2). The effectiveness of the cleaning agent should be judged by inspection of the sample test area after a period of not less than one week after application. The size of the test area may be larger, depending upon the cleaning procedure. The indiscriminate use of muriatic acid or the wrong proprietary compound can cause unsightly, difficult-to-remove stains. Reactions of brick and cleaning solutions are not always predictable and thus it is safer to use a trial-and-error method on a small test area before committing the entire project to a set procedure. Minute quantities of certain minerals found in some fired clay masonry units and materials, such as manganese, added to color brick may react with some solutions and cause staining. Sample testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that will closely approximate the conditions under which the brickwork will be cleaned. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature is 50 oF (10 oC) or above. 
Pressurized Water Cleaning
To cut labor costs, many cleaning contractors utilize pressurized water. Some pressure systems feature a pressure gun and nozzle equipped with a control switch. This setup permits the operator to apply solutions to a wall over 100 ft. (30.5 m) from the base unit. Other systems have two separate hoses - one with plain water and the other with a cleaning solution. Low pressure has been defined as 100 to 300 psi (700 to 2100 kPa), medium pressure as 300 to 700 psi (2100 to 4850 kPa) and high pressure as 700 psi (4850 kPa) or greater. A sand finish or a surface coating may be removed by pressurized water cleaning, resulting in a different appearance. Nozzle pressure in excess of 700 psi (4850 kPa) may damage brick units and erode mortar joints.
The following procedure is suggested:
1. Select and test the cleaning solution on a sample area. Check the equipment for cleaning solution compatibility. For proprietary compounds, mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Presoak wall.
3. Protect metal, glass, wood, limestone and cast stone surfaces. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions.
4. Presoak or saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water, from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below should also be saturated in order to prevent absorption of the run-off from above
5. Application of cleaning solutions may be by a low pressure sprayer, 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa), or through the high pressure cleaning unit.
6. Permit the cleaning solution to remain on the wall for approximately 5 minutes.
7. Starting at the top, flush the wall down, as in the previous procedure.
Caution: It is possible for solutions to be driven into the masonry when applied under high pressure, and become the source of future staining. However, if the walls are sufficiently saturated with water before the solutions are applied, the risk of penetration is reduced. Experience has shown that this cleaning method has a high probability of changing the appearance of sand molded brick, sand- faced extruded brick, and brick with glazed coatings or slurries applied to the finished faces. The brick manufacturer should be consulted on the use of high pressure water cleaning of such brick.


SURFACE PREPARATION
 
********************************
Specifier Notes: Describe surface preparation of substrates required before application of water repellents.
********************************
 
A. Clean all dirt, oil, grease, mold, mildew, efflorescence, or any other coating or material from surfaces that interfere with penetration, performance, adhesion, or aesthetics of water repellents. Rinse thoroughly, using pressure water spray to remove cleaner residues. Allow surfaces to dry completely before application of water repellents.
 
B. Repair, patch, and fill all cracks, voids, defects, and damaged areas in surface as approved by the COR. Allow repair materials to cure completely before application of water repellents.
 C. Seal all open joints.
 D. Allow new masonry and concrete repairs and repointed surfaces to cure before application of water repellents

WATER REPELLENTS
. This specification covers preparation, materials, services, and equipment required for the application of Water Sealant products for projects involving either old or new construction.  Any substantial deviations shall be referred to the manufacturer or authorized representative. Product is manufactured in three strengths, which vary in solids content.  The determination of which formulation is appropriate is dependent upon the porosity of the substrate. Surface type may be concrete, brick, block, stone, stucco, wood and other porous building materials, which allow penetration of the sealant.

A. Surface Preparation: Contractor or Applicator shall be responsible for providing a clean, dry substrate free from oil, dirt, grease, efflorescence or any other coating which may inhibit penetration and adhesion of water repellent.  This requirement applies to new construction, renovation or remedial projects. Substrate must be completely dry prior to applying product.
B.  Environmental Requirements:
1. Temperature: Product may be applied at any temperature providing that there is no frozen moisture present in the substrate.  When applied at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the product may cure at a slower rate. Optimal temperatures should be above 40Ña F (5Ña C) or below 95Ña F (35Ña C).
2. Do not apply material if the substrate is wet or contains frozen moisture. Allow substrate to dry for a minimum of 48 hours after rain or power washing.
3. Do not apply material during inclement weather or if precipitation is expected within 12 hours.
4. Do not use spray methods of application under windy conditions.
 
C.     Protection:
1. Special precautions should be taken to avoid fumes from entering the building being treated. Ventilation systems and fresh air intakes should be turned off and covered.
2. Protect shrubs, metal, glass, vehicles, and other building hardware from overspray.

TEST PANELS
 
A. Before full-scale application, review manufacturer°¶s product data sheets to determine the suitability of each product for the specific surfaces. Apply each water repellent to test panels to determine appropriate strength, coverage rates, compatibility, effectiveness, surface preparation, application procedures, and desired results.
 
B. Apply water repellents to test panels in accordance with manufacturer°¶s written instructions. Allow 24 hours or until test panels are thoroughly cured before evaluating final appearance and results. Do not begin full-scale application until test panels are inspected and approved by the COR.

Submittals: For each paint system specified, provide the following:
1.   Material List: Provide an inclusive list of required coating materials. Indicate each            material and cross-reference specific coating, finish system, and application.

GENERAL
     This Section includes surface preparation, field cleaning and sealing of exposed exterior building surfaces.  

INTRODUCTION
Many of the problems of brick masonry, brought to the attention of the Brick Institute of America over the past years, have resulted from improper cleaning methods. Some walls have been irreparably damaged as a result of a lack of attention to cleaning details and procedures.
Cleaning failures generally fall into one of three categories: 
1. Failure to thoroughly saturate the brick masonry surface with water before and after application of chemical or detergent cleaning solutions. Dry masonry permits absorption of the cleaning solution and may result in "mortar smear", "white scum", or the development of efflorescence or "green stain". Saturation of the surface prior to cleaning reduces the absorption rate, permitting the cleaning solution to stay on the surface rather than be absorbed.
2. Failure to properly use chemical cleaning solutions. Improperly mixed or overly concentrated acid solutions can etch or wash out cementitious materials from the mortar joints. They have a tendency to discolor masonry units, particularly lighter shades, producing an appearance frequently termed "acid burn" and can also promote the development of "green" and "brown" stains. 
3. Failure to protect windows, doors, and trim. Many cleaning agents, particularly acid solutions, have a corrosive effect on metal. If permitted to come in contact with metal frames, the solutions may cause pitting of the metal or staining of the masonry surface and trim materials, such as limestone and cast stone.
Before the actual cleaning of a project begins, all cleaning procedures and solutions should be applied to a sample test area of approximately 20 sq. ft. (1.9 m2). The effectiveness of the cleaning agent should be judged by inspection of the sample test area after a period of not less than one week after application. The size of the test area may be larger, depending upon the cleaning procedure. The indiscriminate use of muriatic acid or the wrong proprietary compound can cause unsightly, difficult-to-remove stains. Reactions of brick and cleaning solutions are not always predictable and thus it is safer to use a trial-and-error method on a small test area before committing the entire project to a set procedure. Minute quantities of certain minerals found in some fired clay masonry units and materials, such as manganese, added to color brick may react with some solutions and cause staining. Sample testing should be performed under conditions of temperature and humidity that will closely approximate the conditions under which the brickwork will be cleaned. Chemical cleaning solutions are generally more effective when the outdoor temperature is 50 oF (10 oC) or above. 
Pressurized Water Cleaning
To cut labor costs, many cleaning contractors utilize pressurized water. Some pressure systems feature a pressure gun and nozzle equipped with a control switch. This setup permits the operator to apply solutions to a wall over 100 ft. (30.5 m) from the base unit. Other systems have two separate hoses - one with plain water and the other with a cleaning solution. Low pressure has been defined as 100 to 300 psi (700 to 2100 kPa), medium pressure as 300 to 700 psi (2100 to 4850 kPa) and high pressure as 700 psi (4850 kPa) or greater. A sand finish or a surface coating may be removed by pressurized water cleaning, resulting in a different appearance. Nozzle pressure in excess of 700 psi (4850 kPa) may damage brick units and erode mortar joints.
The following procedure is suggested:
1. Select and test the cleaning solution on a sample area. Check the equipment for cleaning solution compatibility. For proprietary compounds, mix in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Presoak wall.
3. Protect metal, glass, wood, limestone and cast stone surfaces. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions.
4. Presoak or saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water, from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below should also be saturated in order to prevent absorption of the run-off from above
5. Application of cleaning solutions may be by a low pressure sprayer, 30 to 50 psi (200 to 350 kPa), or through the high pressure cleaning unit.
6. Permit the cleaning solution to remain on the wall for approximately 5 minutes.
7. Starting at the top, flush the wall down, as in the previous procedure.
Caution: It is possible for solutions to be driven into the masonry when applied under high pressure, and become the source of future staining. However, if the walls are sufficiently saturated with water before the solutions are applied, the risk of penetration is reduced. Experience has shown that this cleaning method has a high probability of changing the appearance of sand molded brick, sand- faced extruded brick, and brick with glazed coatings or slurries applied to the finished faces. The brick manufacturer should be consulted on the use of high pressure water cleaning of such brick.


SURFACE PREPARATION
 
********************************
Specifier Notes: Describe surface preparation of substrates required before application of water repellents.
********************************
 
A. Clean all dirt, oil, grease, mold, mildew, efflorescence, or any other coating or material from surfaces that interfere with penetration, performance, adhesion, or aesthetics of water repellents. Rinse thoroughly, using pressure water spray to remove cleaner residues. Allow surfaces to dry completely before application of water repellents.
 
B. Repair, patch, and fill all cracks, voids, defects, and damaged areas in surface as approved by the COR. Allow repair materials to cure completely before application of water repellents.
 C. Seal all open joints.
 D. Allow new masonry and concrete repairs and repointed surfaces to cure before application of water repellents

WATER REPELLENTS
. This specification covers preparation, materials, services, and equipment required for the application of Water Sealant products for projects involving either old or new construction.  Any substantial deviations shall be referred to the manufacturer or authorized representative. Product is manufactured in three strengths, which vary in solids content.  The determination of which formulation is appropriate is dependent upon the porosity of the substrate. Surface type may be concrete, brick, block, stone, stucco, wood and other porous building materials, which allow penetration of the sealant.

A. Surface Preparation: Contractor or Applicator shall be responsible for providing a clean, dry substrate free from oil, dirt, grease, efflorescence or any other coating which may inhibit penetration and adhesion of water repellent.  This requirement applies to new construction, renovation or remedial projects. Substrate must be completely dry prior to applying product.
B.  Environmental Requirements:
1. Temperature: Product may be applied at any temperature providing that there is no frozen moisture present in the substrate.  When applied at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the product may cure at a slower rate. Optimal temperatures should be above 40Ña F (5Ña C) or below 95Ña F (35Ña C).
2. Do not apply material if the substrate is wet or contains frozen moisture. Allow substrate to dry for a minimum of 48 hours after rain or power washing.
3. Do not apply material during inclement weather or if precipitation is expected within 12 hours.
4. Do not use spray methods of application under windy conditions.
 
C.     Protection:
1. Special precautions should be taken to avoid fumes from entering the building being treated. Ventilation systems and fresh air intakes should be turned off and covered.
2. Protect shrubs, metal, glass, vehicles, and other building hardware from overspray.

TEST PANELS
 
A. Before full-scale application, review manufacturer°¶s product data sheets to determine the suitability of each product for the specific surfaces. Apply each water repellent to test panels to determine appropriate strength, coverage rates, compatibility, effectiveness, surface preparation, application procedures, and desired results.
 
B. Apply water repellents to test panels in accordance with manufacturer°¶s written instructions. Allow 24 hours or until test panels are thoroughly cured before evaluating final appearance and results. Do not begin full-scale application until test panels are inspected and approved by the COR.

Submittals: For each paint system specified, provide the following:
1.   Material List: Provide an inclusive list of required coating materials. Indicate each            material and cross-reference specific coating, finish system, and application.
     Identify each material by manufacture°¶s catalog number and classification.
     2.   Manufacture°¶s Information: Provide manufacture°¶s technical information,
      including label analysis and instructions for handling, storing, and applying each  
      coating material proposed for use.
     
Water Sealant: Penetrating silicone rubber water repellent for use on vertical or horizontal concrete, dense brick, and granite. Penetrates without altering the natural appearance of the substrate.  Will not form a surface film or gloss.  Inorganic, it is not affected by UV rays, salts, acid rain, etc. Breathable, it allows moisture vapor to escape while preventing liquid penetration. Flexible, it bridges hairline cracks and allows for building movement.  Provides superior waterproofing protection.
1.      Form: Liquid
2.      Color: Clear
3.      Active Substance: RTV Silicone Rubber
4.      Percent Active Material: 5-15%
5.      Flash Point: 105Ña


General Requirements      
     All materials shall be approved by the CO or COR prior to purchase and installation. Materials delivered to the project site must be in manufacture°¶s original, unopened packages and containers bearing manufacture°¶s name and label.   
     Alcoholic beverages shall not be permitted on premises. Anyone smelling of or impaired by, alcoholic beverages shall be immediately removed from premises and bared from working on this project.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to an electronic Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Variable Tilt Terrain Platform (VTTP) for the Mars Science Laboratory Touchdown Dynamics Testbed. JPL, located in Pasadena, California, will launch a rover to Mars in 2009. The rover is expected to arrive in 2010 and will be delivered to the Mars surface using a new Entry, Descent and Landing System. The rover will use a rocket powered descent stage to lower the rover safely to the surface directly onto its wheels. The VTTP to be procured will provide the terrain conditions for testing the rover's new landing technique. The VTTP is needed to quickly and accurately vary the terrain characteristics that the test system will encounter during the touchdown event. A competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort was posted electronically to JPL's web site on January 19, 2005.  The RFP, related documents and attachments (e.g., specimen contract, exhibits, etc.) can be access at:	    http://acquisition.jpl.nasa.gov/rfp/       RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the RFP are due no later than February 14, 2005.

<DESC>Review of Bids Submitted by Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plan Sponsors

Background

The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)  has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries.  First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D (ìPart Dî), that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs).  Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) ìlocal plansî, formerly Medicare Plus Choice (M+C) plans, and creates a new type of private plan, ìRegionalî MA plans.  Finally, the legislation specifies that, beginning with contract year 2006, organizations bidding for contracts or with contracts that offer PDP and MAs must annually submit bids that support the actuarial basis of its pricing.  The 2006 bids are to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by June 6, 2005.

CMSí Office of the Actuary has been assigned the responsibility to review the submitted bids for reasonableness against CMS guidelines and instructions, conformity with the statute, and compliance with the appropriate Actuarial Standards of Practice.  Given the required coordination of the actuarial bid reviews with related activities to be performed by other CMS components, OACTís assessment of the bids must be completed in relatively short timeframe (approximately 6 weeks).  However, OACT does not have adequate number of staff members required to review and approve the anticipated volume of bids within this timeline.  As a result, CMS/OACT intends to procure advisory and assistance services from independent actuarial firm(s) to assist with the review of the 2006 MA and PDP actuarial bids.

Contractor responsibility

Contractor will review the reasonableness of assigned bids in consideration of (i) CMSí bid submission instructions, (ii) CMSí bid review guidelines, and (iii) professional actuarial standards.

The reviews will be performed within a set bid review process to be established by CMS.  Some of the main components of the process are listed below. For each assigned bid, the process will contain a representation of the original submitted bid supplemented with additional data such as statistical distribution of key values across all peer plans and an overview of the filed benefit package.   Additionally, the bid review process will provide an e-mail communication link to actuary that developed the bid.  Finally, contractor is to communicate to CMS the result of his reviews by completing the appropriate status section of the review process.

CMSí review guidelines highlight the most important areas for the bid reviews for both Part D and other benefits (that is, Part A, Part B, and non-Medicare covered).  The most important areas to be examined are the (i) base period data, (ii) projection of base period data to the contract year, (iii) manual projection data if base period data is absent or deemed to be less than fully credible, and (iv) components of resulting bid for the contract year.

The review of the bids will take place between June 8, 2005 and September 2, 2005, with the bulk of the work to be completed by July 30, 2005.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to attend a training session in May 2005 (date TBD) and provide CMS with a written evaluation of their experience with the bid reviews by September 30, 2005.

At this time, neither the bid form nor the bid review specifications are available for release.  However, the draft bid form will be posted on CMSí web site on or about November 29, 2004 at http:/cms.hhs.gov, or may be obtained by sending an e-mail request to actuarial-bid@cms.hhs.gov.  Additionally, the specifications for the bid review system process will be contained in the Request for Contract package (to be sent in early 2005).

Type of Procurement 

CMS anticipates issuance of multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts under the forthcoming single solicitation to two or more sources using Firm Fixed Price task orders with a minimum order to gear up and complete training requirements and a maximum order limitation to be determined based on feedback from this RFI.   It is also anticipated that these awards will be issued with a base year and 3 options.  However, CMS does reserve the option to use any other procurement instrument as deemed appropriate at the time of the official solicitation.  

Response requested from prospective contractors

CMS would like you to respond to this RFI with the following information.  

1.	Your firmís experience, establishing and reviewing pricing of managed health care plans, including prescription drug benefits.  Please provide examples of establishing and reviewing pricing by specifying the type of health care plans (for example, Medicare Advantage programs, Medicaid, commercial, and retiree health).  Also, if applicable, please provide a description of your experience in subcontracting with other actuarial consulting firms.

The proces s of inspection involves the use of X-ray and gamma radiation inspection methods, therefore the source sought will be licensed for work on such equipment by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The International Harvester truck bed that carries the inspecti on equipment is also included in the maintenance plan and the source sought will be responsible for acquiring and providing the necessary spare parts and consumables required for routine preventative maintenance and unscheduled repairs due to break down fo r the truck as well as for the inspection devices and systems.  The Mobile VACIS are scattered throughout SWA and movement from one location to another may require armed security escorts.  The source sought will be a proven supplier of professional logisti cs services related to nuclear grade equipment and wheeled vehicles and have experience working in a hostile environment with limited or no infrastructure for support.  The requiring agency is not in a position to provide technical details regarding either  the truck or its inspection system.

<SUBJECT>Achieving Interoperability with Digital Signature Standards
<DESC>January 19, 2005 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Sponsoring Organization:	Office of the Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer On behalf of:	Department of Defense Digital Signature Interoperability Team Subject:  ACHIEVING INTEROPERABILITY WITH DIGITAL SIGNATURES Introduction: This is a request for industry comments synopsis and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal, award a contract or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis is for information gathering only and does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate technical policy is may choose to implement or, if applicable the acquisition procedure it may choose to pursue.   General Background: Over the last 3-4 years, the Department of Defense has aggressively deployed an identity management system that combines the use of hardware token (e.g. the Common Access Card (CAC)) and public key technologies (e.g. DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)).  These components are envisioned to be used to provide non-repudiation and secure authentication to unclassified network and web-based services.  The Department has issued over 5 million CACs, installed hundreds of thousands of smart card readers/middleware, and enabled thousands of web sites to utilize public key technology for authentication.  However, the linchpin to these initiatives is the ability of the Departmentís business owners to re-engineer their business processes to become more efficient and paperless by using CAC, PKI, and digital signatures. Problem Statement: To fully leverage the use of digital signatures across the Department of Defense, it is necessary that digitally signed transactions can be shared with different areas of the Department that very likely will have different desktop configurations.  It has become apparent that current implementations do not provide this flexibility.  Vendor implementations of industry leading digital signature standards (Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #7 and Extensible Markup Language Digital Signature (XML Dsig)) appear to be not interoperable within each standard. To alleviate this concern, a small team of subject matter experts within the DoD has developed implementation guidance (i.e. profiles) of these standards.  This RFI is centered around the attached Draft DoD Profiles for PKCS #7 and XML Dsig.  It is our intent to require all applicable desktop applications (e.g. mostly web-browsing and document processing applications) to implement PKCS #7 and XML Dsig in accordance with these profiles for all future and potentially current product releases.  It will be used to digitally sign documents, electronic forms, and web objects. Specific Questions: Please review the attached draft Profiles and provide any recommendations as desired.  Additionally, if each respondent can address the following specific questions, it would be greatly appreciated. 1.	In your opinion, would these profiles cultivate interoperability as outlined in the problem statement?  Do you have any suggestions on how to improve these profiles? 2.	In your opinion, are there any viable alternatives to providing implementation guidance (i.e. profiles)? 3.	What are your current and future planned implementations?  Do they address the concerns expressed in the problem statement?  Would they meet the requirements outlined in the implementation profiles? Submissions: General comments and questions regarding this RFI shall be directed to Mr. Bill Huber, Contracting Officer, at William.huber@navy.mil or (717) 605-3210.  Specific technical comments and questions should be directed to Mr. Jonathan Baldwin, DoN CIO, at jonathan.Baldwin@navy.mil. Please provide all responses via e-mail to jonathan.baldwin@navy.mil. by COB 03 February 2005

----------3. 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)  

     (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- 
     "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. 
     "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 
     "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. 
     "Registered in the CCR database" means that- 
          (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 
          (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record "Active". 
     (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 
          (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 
     (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 
          (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- 
               (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or 
               (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
          (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 
               (i) Company legal business. 
               (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 
               (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. 
               (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). 
               (v) Company Telephone Number. 
               (vi) Date the company was started. 
               (vii) Number of employees at your location. 
               (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. 
               (ix) Line of business (industry). 
               (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 
     (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 
     (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 
     (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
     (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 
               (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
          (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
     (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. 
                                                           (End of clause)

1.	How long is the workshop and training seminar expected to last (days)?

We expect the actual workshop to be from the evening of the 6th through 18th.  However we will have some individuals arriving and departing at various times throughout the period of March 2nd through March 18th due to airline schedules. 
 
2.	What are the expected start and end times each day?

8:30am to 5:30pm

 
3.	How many breakout sessions take place each day?

There will be one (1) main session with four (4) breakouts.  However, there will not be breakouts each day.
 
 
4.	Is the conference being held at the same hotel where the participants will be staying?

YES

If not is the contractor responsible for transporting the participants to and from the event facility?

The intent is for the conference and lodging to be located at the same hotel.  
 
 
5.	Does the contractor have the responsibility of providing registration services for participants during the event? 

No registration requirements
 
 
6.	Does the contractor have responsibility for identifying and purchasing conference bags, banners and signs? 

No. 

 
7.	What type of administrative support is required from the contractor for on-site conference logistics? 

As identified in the criteria for evaluation we will need a liaison between ADF and the hotel, administrative setup for producing (typing) printing, copying, and distributing certain material for use by conference participants.

 
8.	How many supplies do we need? Up to 50 participants max?  

Currently 50 participants

 

9.	This bid is only for one event coordinator, correct?

We are not specifying the staff.  We leave that to the vendor to identify the number of staff persons that will be needed to provide a timely and complete deliverable.

10.	Please confirm that the contractor should price one set of simultaneous translation services for the entire length of the conference (i.e., 16 days). By one set, I mean translation in one conference room for each day.

ADF is requesting simultaneous translations in the main English/French and French/English conference room for the entire period of the conference. We do not expect translation services for all the breakouts.
