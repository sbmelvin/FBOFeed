<p>Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting office. Interested parties are invited to contact the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.</p>

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01915 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13) exceptions: (i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. A request for quote solicitation will be made through Federal Business Opportunities website and offerors will be able to respond electronically.

 Statement of Work for Services 

Design and Create Wayfinding Visitor Guides and Interactive Map on the Web 
for Syracuse VA Medical Center 

Objective: 
The goal of this project is to enhance the wayfinding ability of Veterans and visitors. An objective of the project is to provide Veterans and visitors easy-to-read guides with accurate map rendering of the campus. Also, prior to visiting the campus, patients would be able to obtain information from the Syracuse VA Health Care System s public website about driving, parking and locations/destinations around campus. The Veterans and visitors must see the same floor design that they see on the interactive map on the web as they will see in hard copy format when they arrive to our campus and any future kiosks or screens around the campus. This provides consistency in the entire wayfinding experience and ensures a more positive patient experience. This is a phased project, and this first portion must be scalable to any future expansions. The system must include a kiosk option for future consideration 
Work Scope: 
Planning begins with a site visit to review and define the scope of the project in greater detail and review the responsibilities of the Vendor and VA facility staff regarding input, design, documentation, coordination, direction and approvals. A project schedule will be established which relates to the project s sequence of events and priorities of importance. Vendor to conduct a site visit to access best wayfinding approach. 
a. Deliverables: Vendor provides meeting minutes and a project schedule 

Vendor to create aerial photographs for map rendering 
Vendor to participate in four conference calls or as needed for the remainder of the work scope to present deliverables, review status, phasing and scheduling updates. 
Vendor to provide the floor design that is to be shown on the interactive map on the web. This first portion must be scalable to any future expansions. Vendor will provide VA Interior Designer with layout, design and details for review, comment and approval. 
a. Deliverables: Hard copy paper and interactive map floor design and details. 1 electronic file. 

The VA Interior Designer will return the design development maps and brochure drawings to the Vendor with final comments and final revisions. Vendor refines and finalizes the physical design of the maps and brochures, based upon client input from VA. 
Vendor to create layout, design and development of visitors guide in the following formats: 

a. Campus Map Booklet: 12 Pages, 4 x 9  Folded Brochure/ 16 x18  Flat, Self-Cover Booklet; Vendor to provide  file only  of the Campus Map Booklet for GPO to print. 
b.  You are Here  Wall Maps - Vendor will provide the  file only  for  You are Here  wall maps to be used throughout the facility. 
c. Interactive map accessible on the desktop/mobile: Specifications provided. 

Selection Criteria: 
Vendor will be selected for the best wayfinding experience for Syracuse VA Health Care System. Vendor will have experience ( 5 + years with sites of similar size and scope ) in producing visitor guides and interactive maps for VA Medical Centers and will have successfully met VA design and Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, section 508 accessibility guidelines 
This is a phased project, and this first portion must be scalable to any future expansions. 
Vendor will outline their approach and recommendations for best practices with examples of similar sized VA projects. This is a phased project, and this first portion must be scalable to any future expansions as all floor designs and renderings can be used for other wayfinding solutions, such as: 
a.  You are Here  Wall Maps 
b. Specific Directional Maps   To help Veterans find hard to find departments.

<DESC><p>Project Overview<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) operates high-containment laboratories (HCLs) to study some of the most virulent threats to public health. Outbreaks involving pathogens such as the Ebola and Zika viruses place increased pressure on our national research resources to maintain appropriate biocontainment environments. CDC's need for continuous high-biosafety level (BSL) containment laboratory space is growing as the threats from existing and emerging high-consequence pathogens are discovered. The design and construction of the High-Containment Continuity Laboratory (HCCL) on the Roybal Campus in Atlanta, Georgia will meet these needs.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation includes full and complete Architectural/Engineering (A/E) design and related services. The Architect-Engineer shall furnish architectural, laboratory planning, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, structural, civil, and any other design disciplines required to perform pre-design studies, program development, investigations, evaluations, design and construction document production, cost estimates, construction administration services, commissioning support, participation in an independent value engineering process, and other related professional services. The Government will utilize the services of a Construction Manager as contractor (CMc) for pre-construction and construction services. The A/E will be required to work with the CMc firm at the pre-design phase through project completion and will agree to accept the relationship of trust and confidence, and covenants with the Government, to furnish the requisite skill and judgements and to cooperate with the CMc in furthering the interests of the Government.</p>

<p>Description<br />The HCCL will be a highly flexible biological laboratory comprised of BSL-3E and BSL-4 laboratories and associated support. The multi-story research building will house adequate laboratory space for eighty laboratorians. The HCCL will have gross building area of approximately 100,000 square feet.</p>
<p>All biosafety features and systems of high containment laboratories will be included such as HEPA filtered supply and exhaust air, air pressure resistant doors, pressure cascade zoning, effluent collection and treatment, pressure decay tested coatings and penetrations, and other systems such as high purity breathing air and chemical decontamination showers that support BSL4 workers donning air pressure resistant suits. The HCCL's architectural character and massing will complement the finishes, textures, and colors of the adjacent Roybal Campus laboratory buildings. The Project includes utility infrastructure extensions necessary to connect the building to existing Roybal Campus utility systems with below grade utility tunnels for chilled water and steam services.</p>
<p>Phase I Solicitation<br />Phase I process requires the potential Offerors to submit their past performance and capability information, including Standard Form 330, for initial review and short-list selection of the Offerors that will be invited to participate in the Phase II Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Government.

<SOLNBR>80HQTR19SOA01
<CONTACT>Bonnie F. James, Senior Acquisition Manager, NASA STMD, Email HQ-STMD-ACO@nasaprs.com
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, anticipates a release of a Space Technology Announcement of Collaborative Opportunity (ACO) on or about October 2, 2018. Once the announcement is posted, complete details (to include due dates) can be accessed via the following steps:
<div><br />1. Open the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ <br />2. Select "Solicitations" <br />3. Select "Open Solicitations" <br />4. Select "80HQTR19SOA01"</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continues to embrace partnerships to achieve its strategic goals for expanding capabilities and opportunities in space. STMD has formulated five strategic thrusts that represent STMD's understanding of the vision for the future of civilian space relative to STMD space research. These thrusts represent major lines of investment within STMD's portfolio that are expected to have major impacts on space through 2040 and beyond. The strategic thrusts are:</div>
<div><br />&bull;	Go: Enable Safe and Efficient Transportation Into and Through Space<br />&bull;	Land: Increase Access to Planetary Surfaces<br />&bull;	Live: Enable Humans to Live and Explore in Space and on Planetary Surfaces<br />&bull;	Explore: Expand Capabilities Through Robotic Exploration and Discovery<br />&bull;	Prosper: Accelerate the Industrialization of Space</div>
<div><br />To support these strategic investment area thrusts, STMD is considering the following Exploration Campaign key technology focus areas for ACO 2019: Advanced environmental control and life support systems &amp; in-situ resource utilization; Power and propulsion technology; Advanced materials; Communications, navigation and avionics; Entry, descent, and landing; Autonomous operations; In-space manufacturing and on-orbit assembly; and Research to enable humans to safely and effectively operate in various space environments.</div>
<div><br />NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) is seeking partnerships that will focus on advancing technologies that can benefit both the commercial and government use of space. NASA is seeking to provide technical expertise, facilities, hardware, and software to accelerate the development and availability of these technologies.</div>
<div><br />NASA will solicit proposals that are led by a U.S. for-profit entity to partner with one or more NASA Centers as a team member(s) to enter into non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements (SAA) to support the accelerated development and testing of critical technologies for space system capabilities. A "U.S. for-profit entity" is a commercial firm or business incorporated in the United States (or an unincorporated U.S. firm with its principal place of business in the United States) that is controlled by U.S. citizens or by another U.S. entity. In addition to one or more NASA Centers, team members may include other U.S. for-profit entities, U.S. non-profit entities (including universities and educational institutions), and/or U.S, Federal, State and local government agencies, as appropriate to optimize the potential for rapid development and commercialization of the space technology. See Section 3.0 of the Announcement for complete eligibility restrictions. These non-reimbursable SAAs will serve to implement the awarded support/collaboration with participating NASA Centers and the awardees to implement a series of mutually beneficial activities consistent with NASA's 2018 Strategic Plan. The final announcement will provide additional information on technology areas being solicited.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />NASA anticipates using a two-step proposal process where a short mandatory preliminary proposal (MPP) is submitted in step one. NASA anticipates providing feedback on the MPP and inviting only the most highly rated/ranked participants to submit a final proposal (step two).&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;   <br />All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an authorized organizational representative (AOR). Registration Information and NSPIRES tutorials can be found at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/ under Getting Started. Potential participants and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system, ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. Interested proposers should monitor the NSPIRES website or subscribe to the electronic notification system for release of this solicitation and any amendments.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />Technical, programmatic, and procurement comments and questions must be submitted in writing by e-mail to: <br />HQ-STMD-ACO@nasaprs.com</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Any documents related to this procurement will be available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ by selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting "Announcement of Collaborative Opportunity (ACO)."</p>
<p><br />It is the participant's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the final solicitation and amendments (if any).</p>

<SOLNBR>80HQTR19NOA01
<CONTACT>Bonnie F James, STMD Senior Acquisition Manager, Email HQ-STMD-SpaceTech-REDDI@mail.nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will be releasing an umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion-2019 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2019)" on or about October 1, 2018. The NRA will be accessible from the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) website, (http://nspires.nasaprs.com ) by clinking through the menu listing "Solicitations", and then selecting "Open Solicitations" and finally selecting "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion-2019 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2019)." Under SpaceTech-REDDI-2019, proposals will be solicited through separate Appendices as funding becomes available for new opportunities. Once new Appendices are released, interested parties will be able to access them by clicking through the Open Solicitations link, then selecting "NRA 80HQTR19NOA01", and then selecting "List of Open Program Elements". It is anticipated that this umbrella solicitation (SpaceTech-REDDI-2019) will be open for one year (through September 2019) and follow-up umbrella SpaceTech-REDDI solicitations will be issued annually on or about October 1 of each year.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The STMD portfolio supports a combination of early-stage studies, for assessing the feasibility of new technologies (which corresponds to a technology readiness level (TRL) range from 1 to 3); maturing feasible technologies through rapid competitive development and ground-based testing (TRL 3-5); and flight demonstrations in relevant environments to complete the final steps prior to mission infusion (TRL 5-7). This technological TRL diversity range results in a sustainable pipeline of revolutionary concepts. STMD seeks aggressive technology development efforts that may require undertaking significant technical challenges and risk to achieve a higher potential payoff.</p>
<p>Directorate level solicitations, as well as specific STMD program solicitations, will be included in the SpaceTech-REDDI-2019 umbrella. Refer to the posted SpaceTech-REDDI-2019 umbrella for the 2019 planned solicitation releases.</p>
<p>Additional information about the STMD Programs is available at http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech . The SpaceTech-REDDI-2019 solicitation will contain target release dates for the Appendices that will be solicited in that year.</p>
<p>To the greatest extent practicable, participation will be open to all categories of organizations, domestic and foreign, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. Foreign entities may also partner with US proposers, but only without the exchange of funding. The Appendices will provide details of the solicited opportunities including: specific scope of the work solicited, anticipated budget for new awards, number of awards anticipated, proposal due dates, and specific instructions about proposal content and evaluation criteria. The number and value of awards will depend on the availability of funds and the quality of proposals received. This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 and NFS 1835.016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov and Grants.gov, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to the NRA.</p>
<p>Information concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be found in the Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Funding Announcement, revised March 2018 Edition located at <br />http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/</p>
<p>Proposals must be submitted electronically using either NASA's proposal data system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com ) or Grants.gov. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g., co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend on submitting proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov, in addition to being registered with NSPIRES. Registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.</p>
<p>Interested proposers should monitor the NSPIRES website or become a registered NSPIRES member and sign up for email notifications for release of the Space Tech-REDDI-2019 umbrella solicitation and Appendices. Further questions concerning the Space Tech-REDDI-2019 solicitation may be submitted to: HQ-STMD-SpaceTech-REDDI@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</p>

<p>Data Quality Analysis &amp; Interpretation Branch, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Surveillance Research Program at the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) of NCI, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E148, Rockville, MD 20850, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Central to the NCI's surveillance enterprise system is the population-based high-quality SEER Program that covers 34% of the U.S. population. SEER collects information on incidence, survival, and prevalence from specific geographic areas and compiles reports on all of these areas plus cancer mortality for the entire U.S. Through special studies, linkage to regional and national data sources, as well as collaborations with other surveillance partners, senior leaders in the SEER Program have been at the forefront of the development and deployment of innovative data coding systems, applied information systems and technical tools, and analytical methodology to advance operations, quality, utility, performance, and interpretation of national cancer burden and progress built on the SEER Program. It also provides essential data to support research and decision-making across the NCI and collaborating organizations in the U.S. and around the world. SEER is recognized internationally as the gold standard for cancer surveillance systems. As our understanding of the biological and genetic determinants of cancer evolve, terminology and classification systems for characterizing the diagnosis and therapy for cancer will continue to change. The NCI SEER Program and associated surveillance systems will need to adapt data collection processes and cross-walks appropriate for the emerging clinical care, translational research, and public health infrastructure. Developmental and pilot studies will need to be designed and implemented to assure relevance, compatibility, interoperability, and evidence-based informed decision making within the SEER Program and across the broader national and international cancer registry-based surveillance community.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541715 and the business size standard is 1,000 Employees.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>

<p>SEER works with other organizations involved with cancer surveillance, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Program of Cancer Registries, the American College of Surgeon's National Cancer Data Base, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), and numerous international organizations and agency partners. These partnerships have resulted in the establishment of a number of ongoing committees charged with the development of data collection standards, oversight of their implementation, and continuous improvement.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order to David Perkins Enterprises (CAGE Code 1J0J6). NSWC-PCD has an emergent need to modify two ISU90 units including doors (8 each), A/C Unit (2 each), build and install customized racks and TRC configuration, compressed air and gas racks, lightning and electrical panel (2 each of each) to support forward deployed warfare units in theater. Awarding to any other source would result in added costs and delays to schedule unacceptable for this requirements. Each unit is significantly large and requires delivery to the vendor's facility along with progress inspections and continuous support communication between vendor and technical liaison. The completion of both units is estimated at $50,000. Based on market research, the completion of work per requirements and any potential savings, are not expected to be recovered through competition. Any other source would have to inspect and pickup units at source or destination to properly submit a quote and complete a deadline of no later than 120 days after award returning to Panama City Florida for inspection and deployment. Based on the complexity of this requirement and continuous need for performance monitoring, the government would be affected as aforementioned. Therefore, it is in the government's best interest to award on a sole source basis to David Perkins Enterprises.

<CONTACT>Samantha Jonjo, Purchasing Agent, Phone 4109655775, Email samantha.jonjo@ssa.gov
<DESC><br />[NOTICE OF INTENT] - The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to solicit Argent, Inc. on a sole source basis for the purchase of Argent Software maintenance. Argent. Inc. is located at 30 Wall Street, 8th Floor New York, NY 10005. SSA conducts this acquisition pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting from a single source, which states, "[c]ontracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization)."
<p>Argent Inc. is the copyright holder for Argent software. Only Argent Inc. has the right to issue an enterprise license for this software.</p>
<p>Continued maintenance of these products is essential. Access to upgrades, updates, and fixes and patches ensures software continues to be compatible with the operating system and is in good working order. Without maintenance, there is potential for a major eDIB infrastructure workload disruption. Argent Inc. provides unique patches and technical assistance necessary to support the eDIB infrastructure. Any interruption to maintenance can severely affect our service to the public.</p>

<DESC>This is not a Request for Prototype Projects, but for planning purposes only. A project will not be awarded from this announcement. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic would like to announce a Request for Prototype Projects through the Information Warfare Research Project (IWRP) Consortium.  In order to obtain more information regarding the below projects, you must be a member of the IWRP Consortium.  For more information on becoming an IWRP consortium member, please visit https://www.theiwrp.org. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the IWRP Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. The Government anticipates four (4) projects for white papers and full proposals to be solicited via N65236-18-9-0001 - consisting of the following: 1.  USMC Multi-Cloud  This request will seek to develop a prototype to rapidly develop a Commercial Service Provider (CSP) agnostic write-once/deploy-many type capability, in an Agile Software Development Framework. It will enable developers to code description of virtual networks, hosts, load balancers, virtual private networks (VPNs) in one location and have CSP specific classes translate the environment and call upon CSP's specific Application Programming Interfaces to deploy environment to a single or multiple concurrent cloud providers.  (This was previously synopsized as the Universal Cloud Infrastructure Deployment Capability.) 2. Enterprise Network & Internal Private Cloud -  This request will seek to develop a prototype for the: (a) creation of an enterprise network to link multiple, independent & geographically separate work centers together with a multi-site, multi-tenant internal private cloud that utilizes Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies to automate network operations, minimizing required manpower to operate the network; (b)Provide seamless workload mobility between work centers and for the ability of a user at one work center to utilize computing resources at another work center and internet access at another work center; and (c) creation of a two-location global network operations center (NOC) that will operate & maintain the enterprise network/private cloud. (This was previously synopsized.) 3. Low Altitude Range Communication System (LARCS)  This request will seek to rapidly prototype an enterprise LARCS solution which satisfies United States Marine Corps (USMC) range communication requirements and addresses the existing interoperability and maintainability challenges. 4. Security Operations Center (SOC) of the Future  This request will seek to create a prototype for a next-generation SOC. The SOC will encompass an enterprise network, utilizing Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies to link multiple, geographically- separated SOCs which will all control their own individual operational, stand-alone networks, also utilizing SDN. Additional information on IWRP or to become a member, please refer to the following link: https://www.theiwrp.org

<DESC>This work is necessary to repair Union Village Dam's East Access Road at 12 separate locations along its 3 miles. The road sustained substantial damaged during a high intensity storm event that dropped roughly 4.5 inches of rain in a short period of time on July 1, 2017. The damage sustained includes, but is not limited to, extensive washout and collapse along portions of the road, displacement of culverts, erosion along road edges, clogging of several culverts, sediment and debris deposits at inlet and outlet of several culverts, scouring at outlet end of culverts, sediment and debris deposits adjacent to the road, and the filling of roadside drainage ditches with sediment, debris, and brush. The road is currently closed and will remain closed until completion of the repairs.
<p>The construction work will consist of the full depth rebuilding of approximately 900 feet of gravel road with new roadside drainage ditch; the full depth rebuilding of approximately 700 feet of bituminous concrete paved road with new roadside drainage ditch; the removal and offsite disposal of one 48-inch diameter bituminous coated corrugated metal pipe (BCCMP) culvert and its replacement with 54-inch reinforced arch concrete pipe; the removal and offsite disposal of five 15-inch to 30-inch diameter bituminous coated corrugated metal pipe (BCCMP) culverts and their replacements with high density polyethylene (HDPE) corrugated pipes; the removal, offsite disposal, and replacement of four existing concrete block drop inlets and their iron castings with precast reinforced concrete drop inlets; the installation of three dry fieldstone headwalls and one precast reinforced concrete headwall; the placement of rock-lined inlet and outlet protection at each new culvert; the cleaning, regrading, and rock-lining inlet and outlet swales at several culverts to remain in place; the import and placement of approximately 500 cubic yards of beach sand and the grading of the material to reestablish a 5,400 square foot beach adjacent to the Ompompanoosuc River; the removal and offsite disposal of sediment, debris, and brush from approximately 2,000 feet of existing 3 foot wide by 2 foot deep roadside drainage ditches and their regrading and hydroseeding; the removal and offsite disposal of washover material consisting of sediment, cobbles, debris, and brush from a 4,000 square foot area; minor repairs at eight locations along the gravel road by filling and compacting eroded areas and washed out road edges; the cleaning and flushing of four existing 15-inch to 30-inch diameter HDPE pipe culverts; the rock-lining of two large slope areas with 24-inch riprap with a portion of the toe work to be within the Ompompanoosuc River; the removal and offsite disposal of 12 linear feet of existing gabion wall and the installation of 42 linear feet of new gabion wall to widen gravel road; and the installation, maintenance, and removal of erosion and sediment controls. The road repair work will also require gravel road maintenance work by repairing, grading, and compacting ruts and potholes with 250 cubic yards of gravel fill at specified locations along the 2.5 miles of gravel road, and the resetting of a property boundary marker by a professional land surveyor licensed in the state of Vermont. As part of this work the contractor will be required to schedule and maintain continuous hauling of large quantities of offsite borrow and gabion fill materials via numerous dump trucks so as not to disrupt offsite traffic or violate any transportation rules and regulations.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
INTEGRATIVE HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM: 
ACUPUNCTURIST

Background Information/Purpose 
The Integrative Health & Wellness Program (hereafter  IHW Program ) in Washington, DC offers holistic complementary and integrative medicine interventions to Veterans in a comprehensive clinic setting. Currently, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, qigong, integrative nutrition, massage, tai chi, meditation and integrative health education courses are offered to Veterans from across the hospital. The services rendered by the IHW Program have been well-received thus far by not only Veterans but providers and staff within the Washington, DC VA Medical Center (hereafter  DC VAMC ).  It has become evident that an acupuncturist is necessary to perform services to Veterans. In addition to serving as an acupuncturist, the individual will contribute as needed to help foster the growth of the IHW Program at the DC VAMC. The acupuncturist will also support wellness or research endeavors, as requested, in other areas or services within the DC VAMC.  


Information Security 
The acupuncturist may be required for storing or maintaining VA sensitive information. According to VHA Handbook 6500.6, Appendix C (3) (h),  the contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.   The Acupuncturist shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. See the related clauses at the end of this document.

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program and VHA Directive 1605.01, Privacy and Release of Information.. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: (1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior , which will be provided during the kick-off meeting; (2) Successfully complete the  VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior  training and annually complete required security training (see Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) #6) ; (3) Contract is aware of and will successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy/HIPAA training and annually complete required privacy/HIPAA training (see CLIN #6); and (4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access (see CLIN #6). 


The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the contracting officer representative (COR) a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.


Clinical Requirements
The individual must be licensed in acupuncture (L.Ac.) and have a masters in acupuncture (M.Ac.). The individual must have at least five (5) years of experience providing acupuncture. The individual must demonstrate the ability to work with a Veteran population that is ethnically diverse and disadvantaged. The individual must adhere to VHA policies for clinical providers, as delineated by the credentialing staff at the DC VAMC. If the acupuncturist is not a licensed clinician (i.e. MD, PhD, PsyD), the acupuncturist must have a clinical supervisor within the DC VAMC identified by the IHW Program Director, unless otherwise directed or notified. Any additional credentialing/certification and licensing necessary to offer these services must be maintained.


Implementation 
The acupuncturist will work at the DC VAMC with an agreed upon schedule. The acupuncturist will require a desk, and access to a phone and/or computer. The acupuncturist will work under the guidance and supervision of the IHW Program Director, unless otherwise noted.  


Significance of this Project 
As demand continues to grow in the medical center, and as more Veterans request increased access to complementary treatment options, the work that is being done by the IHW Program has become a necessity. The acupuncturist will not only meet the demand of increased Veteran care, but will work with the staff of the IHW Program and elsewhere within the Medical Center, subject to IHW Director s approval. The combined effort of the IHW Program and acupuncturist will lead to an increase in access and quality of care for Veterans.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside.  This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research.  No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p>The 422St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below.  The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements exist and can be located in FedBizzOps.  A Source Approval Request (SAR) package must be submitted for approval determination to the Oklahoma City Small Business Office.   Consequently, potential sources for this effort are companies who have a licensing agreement with the Data Rights Holder or Original Equipment Manufacturer.   The company must have manufactured the Subject or Similar item within the past 36 months for the Original Equipment Manufacturer or Department of Defense and intends to produce Subject item to the Subject technical data.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1250 employees.
