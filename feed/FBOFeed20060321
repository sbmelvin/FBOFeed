<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the BURNS PAIUTE TRIBE to trap and transport bull trout at Agency Valley Dam. The deliverables under this contract will address certain terms and conditions of the 2005 bioligical opinion and maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act.  The opinion directs Reclamation to implement measures to minimize the effects and or amount of take associated with operation of Agency Valley Dam.  The requirement - Trap and return bull trout that are entrained at Agency Valley Dam back to Beulah reservoir or the north Fork Malheur River upstream from the dam.   All bull trout entrained below the dam will suffer take through death due to poor habitat conditions in the river. Services required are for the trap and transport of federally protected animals to reduce take and maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act for federal actions.  This is an exclusive governmental service requiring a federal permit that mandates expertise in care and handling of federally protected animals.  The Tribe has done the most advanced fisheries work in this remote area of Agency Valley Dam and therefore is the most knowledgeable entity to trap and transport federally listed bull trout. The Tribes employ staff members who are trained and federally permitted for the capture and handling of ESA protected species and have completed these activities for Reclamation each spring since the listing of bull trout in 1998.  The BPT currently holds a permit to capture and transport fish in the State of Oregon.  Parties who believe they have knowledge sufficient to respond may e-mail their firm's qualifications to the following address.  mday@pn.usbr.gov   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

The first vessel (in conjunction with a vessel currently under contract) will commence survey operations on or around May 23, 2006 and complete survey operations approximately sixty-seven (67) days later on or around July 28, 2006.     The second vessel (in conjunction with a vessel currently under contract) will commence survey operations on or around August, 15, 2006 and complete survey operations approximately sixty-seven (67) days later on or around October 20, 2006.     The charters will begin in Newport, OR and end in San Diego, CA.     Each charter period will be broken into five to six cruise legs of seven to ten days each with a two to three day port call between legs for refueling, re-provisioning, personnel changes, and landing the catch.     A minimum of 33 working days at sea with a Government option for 10 additional working days will be required for each charter, not including port calls, time spent running to and from towing sites, or days when operations must be suspended due to bad weather, break downs, or other contingencies.     Each vessel will conduct an independent survey of the shelf and slope zone from 30 to 700 fathoms, extending from the Canadian border around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, CA.     Survey stations will be designated in the sampling manual to representatively sample this range of depths, and will be randomly pre-selected within an INPFC area and depth strata.     Each of the vessels will be allocated approximately 180 of these stations.     An average of four to five tows will be conducted per day.       

Trawl gear to be used during this survey will be supplied by the NWFSC.     The Government furnished trawls, rigging, and accessories will be of a type commonly used in slope and shelf fisheries, scaled to fit vessels ranging from 425 to 800 horsepower.     The vessel’s main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower of 425 while not being rated more than 800 horsepower.     The vessel must be capable of towing the experimental gear at a minimum speed of 2.2 knots at a fishing depth of 700 fathoms.     The vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of at least eight (8) knots in low sea states.     Trawl cables runs must be directly from the winches to the towing blocks.     The vessel must be at least sixty (60) feet in length and must be seaworthy and suitable for trawling operations in the above region during the season indicated.     The vessel must be completely rigged for stern trawling and must also allow for thru-hull cabling for acoustic transducers that will be installed in dry dock.     At the end of the charter period, transducers will be removed and the perforation will be secured with two caps.     The working deck must be a clear, open space 12 ft x 8 ft for location of a NWFSC-supplied 8 ft x 4 ft sorting table.     Vessel must be equipped with a working railing height of no less than 38 to 42 inches (OSHA).     There must be berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and three (3) scientists, one or more of which may be female.     

Two awards will be made resulting from this solicitation.   Awards will be made utilizing the best value continuum. Evalution will be based on Vessel Characteristics, Vessel Configuration, Vessel’s Commercial Fishing History, Master/Crew Work Experience, Offeror Qualifications, Desirable Items, and Evaluated Price.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Louisiana is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements (BPA’s) for technical review of appraisals.  BPA’s will be established for a 5 year period (base year and 4 option years).  A BPA does not obligate the Government to order or the vendor to furnish any articles of any quantity except to the extent that may be agreed upon in connection with individual transactions or BPA calls.  Obligations are made at the time of each call.  Appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of Louisiana that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) or related program(s).  The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.  The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.  Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser in Louisiana.  The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards.  This action is a 100 % set-aside for small business concerns under NAICS Code 531320, which has a small business size standard of $1.5 million.

<CONTACT>Cathy Mirra, Contract Specialist, cathy.mirra@hanscom.af.mil, (781) 377-5998 or Priscilla Busa, Contracting Officer, priscilla.busa@hanscom.af.mil, (781) 377-8673
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action for the proposed purchase of a Terrain Following Deployable Intrusion Detection Sensor for test and evaluation by the United States Air Force.  The acquisition is to include all tasks needed to procure production representative pieces of hardware, develop contractor test plans and procedures, perform an evaluation/test with results documented, prepare technical installation and operation input material, source control drawings to establish a configuration baseline and support a test at Eglin AFB (i.e., train initial test cadre and set-up sensor).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Senstar-Stellar Corporation (SSC), under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The requirement is for an above ground line sensor that can be installed in less than 20 minutes per 50 meters by two personnel without specialized equipment. The installation area can vary in terrain and the sensor should be suitable where there is uneven terrain or vegetation that prevents effective use of line of sight microwave sensors, short distance breakwire or breakbeams. The sensor will also meet the Integrated Base Defense Security System (IBDSS) and Tactical Automated Security System (TASS) requirements for probability of detection, low invalid (combination of nuisance and false) alarm rate, and can be rapidly deployed. Specifically, this requires at a minimum, a probability of detecting an intruder of 0.90 at the 90% lower confidence limit.  This probability of detection is 0.95 for fixed site applications.  The sensor will also operate with a rate of two or less invalid alarms per sensor per twenty-four hours.  System shall operate in the range of temperatures between -40 to +70 degrees Celsius (-40 to +158 Fahrenheit). System shall operate satisfactorily in non-condensing relative humidity ranges up to 95% and condensing relative humidity up to 100%.  This deployable sensor shall meet performance requirements in sustained winds of up to 55.6 Km per hour (34.5 mph), without the aid of anchoring devices.  Equipment shall survive sustained winds up to 90 knots (103 mph) (mounting devices shall provide a means to be secured with sandbags, weights, stakes, etc., to withstand more severe environmental conditions, as practical).  Sensor shall operate in sustained rainfall of up to two (2) inches per hour, shall not be damaged by exposure to blowing dust or sand, shall be protected against the effects of lightning, surges and stray electrical charges, and shall withstand exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation without performance degradation for a period of 10 years.  The sensor is required to report alarms of an attempted tamper.  Sensor shall operate with a nominal 12 VDC supply and be operable with a Relocatable Battery Module (RBM) from the TASS equipment suite.  With an RBM, each sensor shall operate without AC power for at least 72 hours when operated at temperatures between 0 and 60 degrees Centigrade.  The RBM shall power the sensor for at least 48 hours when operating temperatures are between -30 and 0 degrees Centigrade. A further goal is for deployment of the sensor to be permitted without the need for radio frequency (RF) spectrum assignment/approval.  Additional goals for sensor set-up are for variable sensitivity, incorporation of a remotely activated self-test and alarms that provide indication of any equipment fault.  The unit cost objective is that a sensor will not exceed $7,500 for a 100 meter sensor segment.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. This acquisition is to be accomplished under FAR Part 15 with an awarded value of less than $500,000. Any firms that believe they can meet the above requirements may identify their interest and capability to the Contract Specialist via email within 15 days of this notice. Responses shall be limited to ten pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Contact Ms. Cathy Mirra, Contract Specialist, at Cathy.Mirra@hanscom.af.mil or (781) 377-5998 with questions regarding this notice.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 5600,has been tasked to provide support of at-sea testing of FSF-1, SEAFIGFHTER (X-Craft) and has created a requirement for technical and engineering support services. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego under the authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplier of services will satisfy agency requirements. The objective of the at sea FSF-1, SEAFIGFHTER test is to measure ocean surface waves near and around the ship while it undergoes at sea evaluation of slamming loads and statistics. The vessel tests are anticipated to include high speeds and rough seas to measure and characterize the ship response to wave impacts and slamming, for comparison to predictive computational tools being developed by the Office of Naval Research. Specialized technical assistance is required in test planning and at sea testing on board the X-craft  (SEAFIGHTER FSF-1) including the preparation of test plans, participation in sea trials and post trials which are essential for ship safety. Vessel tests are anticipated to be conducted from the current berth within San Diego and will include high-speed maneuvers and rough seas trials.  Due to the nature of this specific task, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD is the only source that can provide the Carderock Division with the necessary expertise and instrumentation in order to successfully and safely test the SEAFIGHTER FSF-1. Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego has Dr. Eric Terrill, Ph.D. who is the Director and Chief Operations Officer of the Coastal Observing Research and Development Center located in San Diego, is uniquely qualified technically and is familiar with the immediate area of the testing, familiar with the test methods, data and intent of data collection through participation in past DDX Large Scale Demonstrator, and work with the R/V ATHENA.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Anticipated award date is on or around 4/14/06. Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the point of contact by no later than 4/05/2006.

<SOLNBR>N0016706Q5090
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Dynamic Measurements Branch Code 663, has a requirement for a quantity of ninety-two (92) Endevco 2262A accelerometers to measure acceleration on ships in the navy fleet and on full-scale models of ships during underwater explosion tests. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with the Endevco Corporation of SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, CA under the authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplier of services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Endevco 2262A accelerometer is required to maintain compatibility with the current units now in place. Mechanical filters and foundation blocks were specifically designed to allow use of Endevco 2262A accelerometers. Use of another type unit would require modification to existing equipment which would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) has been tasked to assist in the procurement of an advanced communications system for navy units including submarines.  The communications system, the Navy Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Multiband Terminal (NMT), is currently in the downselect phase of the program.  NUWCDIVNPT intends to award on a sole source basis, a Firm Fixed Price type contract to Linquest Corp. for technical support to assist in this downselect process because Linquest has subject matter expertise in Extremely High Frequency (EHF) terminal configuration and operations.  There are currently no other contractors or government personnel available with the EHF/NMT expertise and knowledge of the system that can perform the requested analysis and review while meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements.  A technical evaluation of the proposals submitted concerning the design, fabrication, assembly, integration, documentation, testing and delivery will be conducted.  Due to the complexity of this procurement, an unusually large team is required to complete this evaluation and a sufficient number of government personnel with required expertise are not readily available.  Contractor support personnel will be used as non-voting members.  The Statement of Work (SOW) contained in the solicitation will identify the technical support that the contractor shall accomplish.  The solicitation will be released on or about 04/05/06.  The level of effort is for 703 man-hours and the period of performance will be six (6) months.  All other timely offers will be considered.  NAICS Code is 541330 and size standard is $25M.  For information on this acquisition contact EILEEN EMOND at 401-832-1482.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) has a requirement to structurally upgrade the ADM-1 and ADM-2 Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to allow for launch and retrieval operations and safe storage onboard a sea frame to support fleet tests and exercises.  Currently the crafts’ lift points and slings are qualified for hoisting weight in accordance to navy practice.  The full load condition weight is higher than the hoisting weight of both crafts, thus the requirement for upgrade.  These upgrades will increase structural integrity of both USVs as well as ensure safe storage of these USVs onboard a sea frame.  NUWCDIVNPT intends to award on a sole source basis a firm fixed price type contract to Willard Marine because they are the original equipment manufacturer of these crafts and uniquely qualified to perform this work.  They designed, installed, tested and certified the craft lift points in accordance with Navy standards and they possess unique knowledge of their craft’s hull structure and its integrity.  The Statement of Work contained in the Request for Quote will provide further detail of the requirements.  The solicitation will be released on our website or about 04/05/06.  All other timely offers will be considered.  NAICS Code is 541330, size standard is $25M.  For information on this acquisition contact EILEEN EMOND at 401-832-1482.

(BAI), Santa Barbara, CA.  The procurement for additional effort is required because there is not available ceiling in the current contract to accommodate the expected increase in requirements for NavMPS support.  As TAMPS is replaced by JMPS, now in transition, an increase in the requirements for NavMPS engineering services and technical support will result as JMPS provides its mission planning capabilities to numerous aircraft types, ship and shore sites, including FMS customers. The period of performance will also be modified for a basic period of five years vice the now four years. Individual Task Orders will be in support of developing and sustaining Naval Mission Planning System!  s (NavMPS), including Foreign Military Sales support pertaining to NavMPS.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

NOAA’s Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI), to assist CO-OPS in drafting a Request for Proposal (RFP) for re-engineering and expanding certain software systems that CO-OPS uses to collect environmental observations and to manage its observing equipment.  CO-OPS will not be awarding a contract as a result of this RFI. This RFI contains preliminary information to serve as a vehicle for CO-OPS to gather information about similar projects that have been accomplished and the practices that have been applied to produce high quality software systems of similar scale and complexity.  This information will be used to help determine the requirements for the RFP in terms of scope, project organizational structure, deliverables management, software lifecycle management, technical requirements and contract cost structure

Technical and background information is contained in the attached document entitled “Support of the CO-OPS Computer Based Information Systems.”  Interested parties should review this material to determine whether sufficient information is contained in it to develop a technical work plan and budget to meet the requirement.  Or, should the document be modified for clarity, expanded to provide more information, or changed in other ways to enable the preparation of a responsive technical proposal and budget. Current estimates are that the period of performance should be approximately 3 years from date of award.

GenVec is the source of a proprietary packaging cell line (293-ORF6) that has a demonstrated safety profile in the production of adenoviral vectors for use in human clinical trials.  In addition, product produced by GenVec has been used in previous clinical trials and is scheduled to be used in an upcoming Phase II trial.  Regulatory requirements indicate that the material for later phase clinical trials must be produced in the same cell line as that used for the initial studies, or the trials will likely need to be repeated at a substantial cost to the government.  Switching to a different packaging cell line or manufacturing technology would require a repeat of a substantial number of previously conducted pre-clinical and clinical studies at a significant and unnecessary duplicative cost to the government.  It is anticipated that any award issued from this solicitation will be a combination firm-fixed and cost reimbursement type contract.  Requests for information or questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing, and can be directed to LaDonna Stewart at ladonna_steawart@nih.gov by May 4, 2006.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Solar Program and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are interested in the development and commercialization of parabolic trough solar power plant technology.  Through a Letter of Interest (LOI), we are seeking to expand U.S. industry involvement and competitiveness in worldwide trough development activities and to help advance the state of parabolic trough technology from a U.S. knowledge base through the USA Trough Initiative. Currently, the USA Trough Initiative is concerned with cost-effective production of components or subsystems for large-scale (1 MWe and up), parabolic trough solar thermal electric power production plants.  This solicitation is intended to better position U.S. industry to manufacture and sell parabolic trough solar thermal electric components and subsystems.  The following components are understood to be of high priority, but are not meant to be exclusive topics for this solicitation: glass or alternative reflector panels, receiver tubes, collector structure, collector heat transfer fluid interconnection (e.g. flexhoses, ball joint assemblies or alternatives), drive systems, and collector or field electronics or controls.  It is expected that the FY06 program funding available under this LOI will be approximately $250,000.00.  Fiscal year 2007 funding availability is not yet determined for this project, however, it is anticipated that a similar level of funding will be available in FY07.  Full text of the solicitation will be available on the NREL web site http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html on or after 03/23/06.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a three year contract with options for two-one year extensions for the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program. The  JRMP will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

Four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas are anticipated within the JRMP. They are:      

o	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR); 

o	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM); 

o	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ); and

o	    IR 1.1.4:  - Enhanced Civil Society Roles in Justice Reform and Modernization (CS-JRM).    

For all of the above, assistance will be emphasized in extending justice services to rural, conflict affected, and marginalized populations.

In addition to the above, the USAID program should also be programmatically positioned and structured for possible implementation of an additional future Program Modifier (contingency) intermediate result; implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. This program modifier would be implemented only if future programmatic authorization and additional funding is provided for implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.  

The estimated ceiling amount of the contract is not to exceed $20.5 million. The Contingency Modifier shall not exceed $2 million. 

The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFPs will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), has a need to lease with the option to purchase an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD SL core system.  The acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. The North American Industry Classification code is 532490 and the business size standard is $6.5M. 

Period of Performance: Base Year: May 1, 2006 – April 30, 2007 with 2 option periods.  

Background:  Instrumentation is required for scientific research and techniques that must be carried out. Cell proliferation is a critical component of immune cell homeostasis and reconstitution.  Current methods to measure this are limited with respect to data interpretation.  Published data have demonstrated the utility and superiority of deuterated glucose measurements by LC/MS technology in measuring cell turnover.  Additionally, unlike current methods to measure dynamic changes in cell turnover, LC/MS based methodologies to measure cell turnover are applicable to both pre-clinical (e.g. murine) and clinical samples.  It is anticipated that the LC/MS system would augment the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) Pre-Clinical Core Service, which is being developed to provide experimental support for pre-clinical and translational research related to Branch activities.  It is anticipated that utilization of the LC/MS system would include laboratories/research activities outside of the ETIB.

Requirements:  Lease with the option to purchase the Agilent 1100 LC/MSD SL core system shall include one (1) each of the following: 1100 LC/MSD SL, API-ESI source, LC/MSD ChemStation software, PC and laser jet printer, 17 hours I&F, Image recovery service with the following configuration: Windows Operating System: Windows XP, Ship-to Country: USA, Installation (44K), Familiarization at Installation (44L), 1 Year SW Upgrade/Phone Assist (44W), 1 YR PC Repair Recovery Service (OTP), 6 fused silica/PEEK connecting capillaries and 100ul flow sensor for use with G1376A and, 500 nL Flow Cell for 1100 DAD/MWD.  The equipment will be used for analysis of pre-clinical and clinical samples for measurements of immune cell turnover using deuterated glucose measurements.  Pre-clinical studies would involve murine models of perturbed T-cell homeostasis and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).  Patient populations from which clinical samples will be obtained include, but not be restricted to: hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT), HIV infection, immunodeficiency, graft-vs.-host disease, and autoimmunity.

Solicitation: The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or facsimile only. Telephone requests will not be accepted. Requests for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax at 301-402-4513. Requests shall include name of the point of contact, DUNS number, telephone number and fax numbers, complete US mailing address, business size standard, and identify the RFQ requested as RFQ-NCI-60050-NG. The estimated issue date of the solicitation package is April 3, 2006 and the estimated due date is April 15, 2006.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) www.bpn.orca.gov.

<DESC>1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement for one (1) machining center for nonferrous metals/woods/plastics in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and specifications.  The specifications are to be used as a guide only; however,  the machine must meet or exceed those specifications that are listed     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number F3P3BD6031A100.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  For small business set-asides other than construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333512; size standard 500 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, Boston College Office of Sponsored Programs, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, on a sole source basis under the authority of Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to assist in funding technical assistance to and oversight/monitoring of states that have received private foundation grants to implement Medicaid program options based on the “cash and counseling” model of consumer-directed home and community-based services.  The contract will enable ASPE to partner with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in funding a research and technical assistance center (RTAC) at Boston College whose principal purpose is to diffuse the specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services gained through the implementation of the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and ASPE.  In 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund awarded grants to twelve new states to design and implement “cash and counseling” options within their Medicaid programs similar to those previously implemented in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Florida under the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration.  Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of the CCDE.  Boston College has, on staff, the project director for the CCDE, who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund have already awarded grants totaling $7.5 million for this initiative to the Boston College School of Social and the participating states.  Any other contractor proposing to bid on this contract would have to have 1) expertise and experience with respect to the “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states on replicating the “cash and counseling” innovation in their states and 2) provide a source of funds for approximately half the cost of supporting technical assistance to states around implementing “cash and counseling” replication programs.    The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE AMENDS THE CLOSING DATE TO FEBRUARY 15, 2006.
USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a three year contract with options for two-one year extensions for the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program. The  JRMP will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

Four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas are anticipated within the JRMP. They are:      

o	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR); 

o	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM); 

o	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ); and

o	    IR 1.1.4:  - Enhanced Civil Society Roles in Justice Reform and Modernization (CS-JRM).    

For all of the above, assistance will be emphasized in extending justice services to rural, conflict affected, and marginalized populations.

In addition to the above, the USAID program should also be programmatically positioned and structured for possible implementation of an additional future Program Modifier (contingency) intermediate result; implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. This program modifier would be implemented only if future programmatic authorization and additional funding is provided for implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICITY AND TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE.  The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate a 90-day sole-source extension of an existing contract (50DGNW-1-90004) with Sypris Test & Measurement, Inc., Orlando, Florida for continued on-site mobile calibration of Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE).  The period of performance will be 1 April 2006 through 30 June 2006.  This extension is being provided until the completion of the competitive follow-on process.  The three (3) categories of TMDE that may be presented by the Government for calibration include:  NEXRAD CONUS (Contiguous United States) TMDE, Miscellaneous CONUS TMDE, and Miscellaneous Outside CONUS TMDE (see Attachment 1 for specific model numbers).  The TMDE are located in 38 sites in CONUS and 2 sites outside CONUS - one in Tiyan, Guam and one in Lihue (Kauai) Hawaii (see Attachment 2 - Calibration Schedule).  The CONUS sites average about 54 items of TMDE (approximately 37 NEXRAD, 17 Miscellaneous).  Approximately 40 TMDE items are in Tiyan and 15 in Lihue (approximately five (5) NEXRAD, the rest Miscellaneous).  The vendor must provide and use a self-contained, generator powered mobile calibration facility at the CONUS sites because there is no room in the Government facilities to bring in calibration equipment and the TMDE must be readily available for immediate Government use.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government=s requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A fixed-price, commercial purchase order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received by close of business 27 March 2006.  See Note 22.

USAID/Colombia is currently working to define the terms of the Request for Proposals or “RFP” that will be issued later this year with respect to the 2006-2010 Human Rights Program in Colombia. We believe it is vitally important to consult Civil Society Organizations on this key issue. A number of consultative meetings are ongoing both in Colombia and in U.S, of which the recommendations and conclusions will be posted to this website. Input received will assist in determining if any Statement of Work (SOW) clarification/changes are needed. Please submit comments only by e-mail to sxavier@usaid.gov and ovallejo@usaid.gov no later that 10:00 a.m. on March 1, 2006. We will only respond to questions received after the RFP is released.  The RFP is expected to be issued on or about mid April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Nanonis GmbH, Technoparkstrause 1, 800 S. Zurich, Switzerland for an oscillator control module (OCM) for research on micro electromechanical resonators similar to cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM). Over the last two decades electronic OCMs for detecting and controlling the amplitude, phase, and frequency of micro resonators have been developed and are offered by several commercial vendors.  The research of NIST requires a better frequency stability not usually available in typical OCMs to afford measurements traceable to the SI unit system. Market research has shown Nanonis GmbH to be the only source capable of meeting all the requirements. The control module shall generally operate in the typical dynamic control modes based on amplitude, frequency, or phase of a vibrating cantilever and measure multiple parameters including amplitude, frequency, and phase in real time.  Methods for auto and manual tuning of the cantilever, determining Q, and performing phase and frequency sweeps shall be integral with the OCM. In addition, oscilloscope mode, FFT mode, and data logging modes shall be provided. The input and output signals should be available digitally as well as through BNC analog outputs. The system shall provide a software package compatible with a PC XP Windows operating system. Note that often the oscillator control module is offered by vendors as an add-on to an AFM. NIST requires that the oscillator control module operate independently from any AFM control system. Specifically, the OCM shall meet the following specifications.  
Input stages: 16 bit with A/D at 10 MS/s or better, 14 bit; 
Frequency range and resolution: 1 kHz to 1 MHz or better, less than 1 microHz resolution; 
Frequency stability: plus or minus 5ppb (referenced to an atomic clock), phase register 48 bit; 
Demodulator: 32 bit, up to 1 kHz BW, less than 10 mdeg phase resolution (16 bit); 
Output stage: D/A 14 bit at 10 MS/s or better; AM 16 bit 1 kHz BW or better; 
Feedback controllers: lock-in and PLL PID 32 bit with 1 kHz BW or better.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. No Solicitation is available. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before April 5, 2006. Anticipated award date is April 6, 2006.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Aeromedical Evacuation Electrical Power Source

The Human Systems Group is seeking information from sources that can provide a small, portable Electrical Power Source for the Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) mission to eliminate dependence on aircraft power.  The preferred sources include rechargeable batteries, fuel cells or other sources that do not emit dangerous exhaust products.

The electrical power source should have as a minimum the following capabilities:

1. 	The volume of the electrical power source must enable the device to fit on the Air Force’s Patient Support Pallet with the patients.  Free space is at a premium.    

2.	The product’s overall weight should be minimized.  Responders should specify whether their device provides power to each individual patient or can serve multiple patients simultaneously. 

3.	   Power (per patient):  300 W continuous, 400W peak (several seconds).  Electrical power should be renewable either by the addition of new fuel or by recharging.

4.	Energy (per patient):  3600 W•hr total capacity (for a 12-hour mission).  This may be distributed over multiple fuel cartridges/battery packs/other energy sources.

5.	Energy density: Greater than 150 W•hr/kg for entire system (i.e. unit plus fuel/batteries) for a 12-hour (3600 W•hr) mission

6.	Provide both 12 VDC and 120 VAC @ 60 Hz via high-efficiency DC-AC converter (> 85%).  Provide output connectors that support a current load of up to 7.5 A.  Provide a design for single or multiple patients with connections to power up to 6 devices per patient.

7.	The electrical power source will operate in an atmosphere where there may be jet fuel vapor present.  The product must not spark for any reason and must not use high volumes of potentially explosive fuel.

8.	If power system emits exhaust products other than water, must demonstrate its safety for use in aircraft cargo bays

9.	It is desired that the technology be ready for production within one year.

10.  	The electrical power source will operate in aircraft at altitude. During an in-flight rapid decompression the expansion in air volume will not diminish the electrical generation capacity of the product. The product should be able to work in a high altitude chamber to 15,000 feet above sea level. The product should be able to undergo a rapid decompression to 45,000 feet above sea level.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_500.4 ) 

11.   	The product will withstand exposure to humidity levels from 5% to 95%.

12.  	The product shall be able to recover after being subjected to high temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 501.4.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_501.4 )

13. 	The product shall be able to recover after being subjected to low temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 502.4.  (See URL: http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_502.4 )

14.	The product shall meet all applicable OSHA standards for safety and EPA standards for disposal.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business organizations including 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veterans as defined by the Small Business Act.  This is a new procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the size is $5 million which is the conversion of  SIC code 8741. Sources are sought that possess the capability to provide support services for the NHLBI.

The NHLBI supports and/or sponsors a variety of task forces, conferences, and workshops and prepares numerous reports and technical documents.  Many of these activities are related to assessment of the state of knowledge in a particular disease or problem area, identification of progress in that area, and formulating recommendations for future research.  Support services are required to assist in conducting such activities and in preparing resulting reports and proceedings.

The work to be performed for this program is an ongoing requirement.  The current contract, N01-HO-29230 with the American Institutes for Research (Prospect Center), was awarded on February 1, 2002.  The current expiration date is January 31, 2007 and a no-cost extension is expected to carry the contract through May 31, 2007.  Past attempts to make this requirement either a small business or 8 (a) set-aside were unsuccessful. Small business offerors proposed to subcontract large parts of the workscope to large businesses and the technical review determined that the proposed management and coordination of these subcontracting arrangements were unworkable and therefore unacceptable.  This synopsis has been prepared to retest the marketplace and determine if it is feasible to conduct the acquisition of the new program as a small business set-aside.
	
There are three basic services to be provided in this program.  The first service is to provide administrative support to scientific working groups.  This work shall include the making of logistical arrangements for scientific meetings of technical experts; design and maintenance of a registration database; development, preparation, and distribution of technical and other support materials for meetings; documentation of meetings; and preparation of summary materials.  The second major service is to provide documentation support to the NHLBI.  This work shall involve the preparation and reproduction of briefing materials, including required editing.  Specifically, documentation services are required to assist in preparation of the NHLBI Fact Book, the NHLBI Chart Book, the routine program and fiscal reviews presented to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council and a variety of special purpose scientific reports including various activities being undertaken by NHLBI extramural program divisions and the Office of  the Director.  The third major service involves provision of analytical support to the NHLBI. This task includes compilation and interpretation of scientific and administrative data and development of suitable graphs, tables, and narratives.  This task also involves analysis and documentation of existing programs and support systems and shall be followed by development and implementation of new or updated systems.

Interested small business firms that are classified under NAICS code 561110 should furnish capability information and appropriate work samples addressing the following:  (a) the status of the organization as a small business, (b) the experience of the organization in performing other similar contract programs, (c) the ability of the organization to perform the entire workscope with a minimum of required subcontracting; offerors should address the administrative and management structure of any proposed subcontracting arrangements to demonstrate that small primes can maintain complete and effective labor, technical, and management control of the program, (d) the ability of the organization to write and edit scientific materials so that the resultant text is scientifically accurate and presented in clear, expository, proper English, (e) the ability of the organization to prepare documents in final form in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including a discussion of alternatives to printing that still provide a high quality product, (f) the ability of the organization to prepare high- quality graphical design services, (g) the ability of the organization to arrange and support professional meetings in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including consideration of travel and other meeting-related tasks and expenses, (h) the ability of the organization to meet with NHLBI staff at the NIH in Bethesda, MD with as little as two hours advance notice, (i) the ability of the organization to conduct analyses of program data and provide clear and concise presentations of results, (j) demonstrated knowledge of the organization of data sources available to, and relied upon by, the NHLBI in performing analytical studies of the performance of Institute research and research training programs, (k) the organization’s access to facilities and other material resources for performance of the workscope, and (l) the ability of the organization to adapt quickly to different workload levels over time.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and none is available. An original and two copies of the capability statement are requested to be submitted to: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Dr, RKL2/Room 6127 MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902.

<RESPDATE>040506

<CONTACT>Billy.J.Durrett, (502) 315-6184
<DESC>The Army is considering ways to implement performance-based contracts for remedial action operations/long-term management (RAO/LTM) activities required at its installations.  This includes but is not limited to treatment systems, maintenance of insti tutional controls, grass cutting, long-term groundwater monitoring and reporting, and other activities associated with maintaining protectiveness of human health and the environment once a remedy is in place and/or has achieved its intended objectives.   A pproximately 55% of the current life cycle environmental liability is made up of RAO/LTM activities.  The percentage will continue to grow as sites achieve Remedy In Place/Remedy Complete (RIP/RC).    The Army is seeking input from large and small businesses on creative ways to structure RAO/LTM PBCs so that the Army can ensure each remedy is effectively making progress toward site cleanup objectives and remains protective of human health and the enviro nment while achieving a reduction in overall cost and/or schedule.  Input can be on the feasibility of the requirement, contract type including use of fixed-price incentive contracts, use of existing Army ID/IQ contracts for procuring RAO/LTM activities, s ize and duration of the contract, data requirements, value engineering to develop options for achieving the remedial objective at the lowest life cycle cost, use of incentives to optimize current remedies, etc.  Suggestions are desired on ways to structure  contracts to incentivize contractors where risk requires bolder decisions, etc.  Input is needed on ideas focusing on what can and should be incentivized, such as RAO optimization performance, new technology applications, reductions in monitoring requirem ents, frequency and schedule reductions, etc., which effectively aid in reducing the overall life cycle costs of the operation and focus on closeout.  The Army intends to award RAO/LTM Task Orders or possibly initiate new LTM PBC contracts during FY06 and wants to obtain market information for planning purposes. As such, any/all input from the contractor community needs to be received by April 5, 2006.  This is not a request for proposal, and as such, no formal questions will be addressed in this effort. Re sponses to these notices are not offers and will not be accepted by the Army to form a binding contract.  It is not mandatory that your firm responds to this RFI.   All information submitted will be held in confidence, and may be used to help structure the  performance work statement (PWS) structure and scope.   If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me for clarification.  Your prompt assistance and input will be greatly appreciated. All responses should be sent to: SHELTON M. POOLE c/o U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District 600 Dr. Martin L.

<SUBJECT>A -- DTIC's IAC Industry Day
<DESC>The 55th Contracting Squadron cordially invites all interested parties to the Defense Technical Information Center’s (DTIC) Information Analysis Centers (IACs) Industry Day.  The Industry Day will be held to provide businesses with information on the IACs contracts and to enhance business relationships.

DoD IACs function as specialized subject focal points for scientific, technical and operational support information (STOSI).  Each of the IACs operate with a core budget for basic operations, including library operations, responses to data inquires, and several technology assessment products per year.  A special feature of these contracts is the ability to perform Technical Area Tasks (TATs) in the area of the IAC’s specialization.  These tasks can be extensive technical assessments, support for workshops and conferences, or bench research and development.  TATs are customer funded and can be awarded non-competitively during the life of an IAC contract.  Several IACs have very extensive (multiple millions of dollars per year) TAT funding.  Customer TAT volume has become one way for DTIC to assess and communicate the value of IACs to the DoD.

Some of the products produced by the IACs are State-of-the-Art Reports (SOARs), Abstracts & Indexes, Bibliographic Search Records, Critical Technical Reviews & Assessments (CRTAs), Newsletters & Current Literature, Referrals to Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) and Scientific & Engineering Databases, Handbooks and References Works.  The IAC program operates in accordance with DoD 3200.14, Principals and Operational Parameters of the DoD Scientific and Technical Information Program, 13 May 1997.  This document may be accessed online at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/ corres/html/320014.htm.  Enclosure 5 of DoD 3200-14 provides a formal overview of the IAC program including the functions and responsibilities of IACs.

Industry Day will be held on April 20, 2006 at the Peter Kewitt Conference Center, in Omaha NE.  Registration is required due to space constraints and will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  No more than two individuals from each company will be allowed to attend and the government may close registration when attendance nears capacity.  Registration form requests can sent to Alan.Brady@offutt.af.mil and Sarah.Davis@offutt.af.mil or faxed to (402) 294-7280, and must be returned with registration $45 fee no later than close of business, 13 April 06.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BIOAEROSOL MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
BIOAEROSOL MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license the technology to build a BioAerosol Mass Spectrometer (BAMS) system.

Background: Researchers at LLNL have developed a BAMS system which permits the real-time analysis of the chemical composition of single cells or other aerosol particles.

Description:  The BAMS system is a collection of hardware and software which analyses aerosols.   The system consists of several processing stages that work in series as a single flow through, real-time analyzer.  Aerosol is first drawn into the system and the particles are focused into a particle beam while the gas is pumped away.  Each individual particle is then analyzed for aerodynamic size, laser induced fluorescence, particle charge, and finally by laser induced desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to determine the chemical composition of the particles.   

Advantages:  The system can sample particles directly from air or from a suspension. It can identify bioaerosol particles of interest among the numerous background particles sampled and identify the nature of these bioaerosol particles of interest.

Potential Applications: Applications include biological defense, fundamental cell biology, and biomedical research.

Development Status:  LLNL has a portfolio of intellectual property covering the BAMS system.
LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's BioAerosol Mass Spectrometer (BAMS) system should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.
Written responses should be submitted by completing our online Company Contact form.

All interested vendors should contact Erika McCallister or Hildy Ferraiolo 
PIVTestBed@nist.gov by April 10, 2006. 

******

We will provide the standard agreement to each vendor by email. Two signed originals of the agreement must be submitted via postal mail by April 17, 2006. To guarantee your agreement is executed in time for participation, we recommend that you submit the agreement immediately after receipt. We expect the demonstration period to begin in late April. This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government will not award any contract on the basis of information or specifications provided by the potential vendor. 
 
******

Please note that NIST is now permitting vendors to provide enrollment systems in the PIV Demonstration. If you have already submitted or executed an agreement, please contact us about amending the agreement to include an enrollment system. 
 
******

Vendor selection criteria are as follows: 

**Interested vendors must have products related to card issuance and management, front-end components, and/or the access control components described in the FIPS 201 Part 2. 
**Products must be capable of demonstrating FIPS 201 Part 2 functionality. 
**Vendors must supply all of the components required to make their products functional within a FIPS 201 implementation. 
**All PIV card applications and middleware solutions must be certified PIV-conformant or be pending certification through the NIST Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP) test labs prior to April 2006. 
**Interested vendors must be willing and able to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NIST.
 
******

The following are suggested categories of products for inclusion into the demonstration. 

**1. Card Issuance and Management Components: 
i. Card printers capable of performing PIV card personalization and initialization. 
ii. PKI solution providers that are interoperable with the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework.
iii. Biometric solution providers that capture biometric data for comparison with real-time biometric samples. 
iv. Enrollment systems capable of capturing and storing PIV data elements. 


**2. Front-end Components: 
i. Smart card contact readers capable of reading PIV cards. 
ii. Smart card contactless readers capable of reading PIV cards. 
iii. Biometric readers capable of performing real-time biometric scans. 
iv. PIN pad devices capable of interoperation with logical and physical access control systems. 
v. PIV cards that are NPIVP certified or pending certification. 

**3. Access Control Components: 
i. Complete physical access control solutions capable of interoperation with PIV cards.
ii. Logical access control systems capable of interoperation with PIV cards. 
a. Network login solutions 
b. Remote access authentication solutions 
c. Web authentication solutions 


**4.PIV System Integrators 
**5.Database Solution Providers for FIPS 201 Implementations 

******

All participating vendors must review and agree to the terms of the sample CRADA (“NIST PIV Demonstration Agreement”) - Attachment 1. The terms of the agreement CANNOT be modified. This agreement provides NIST with the opportunity to perform proof of concept of FIPS 201 and accompanying Special Publications through the PIV demonstrations and to demonstrate the interoperability of PIV cards. It does not allow NIST to evaluate products or endorse any particular product or combination of products therein. Participating vendors are expected to provide samples of their product and any associated documentation and resources in direct support of their product’s integration into the demonstration. The products will be returned to the vendor after the demonstration period. NIST reserves the right to use the equipment again during the 2 year duration of the agreement. Each vendor is expected to cooperate with other vendors participating in the demonstration to the extent necessary to meet the goals of the demonstration. 

Once the list of participating vendors is finalized, NIST will distribute a schedule of different configurations to be demonstrated using the selected products. The schedule will be based upon available configurations of the card issuance and management systems coupled with appropriate access control and front-end systems. NIST cannot guarantee that all of the products provided by participating vendors will be used in the demonstrations. 

The expected outcome of the PIV Demonstration is the verification that products supporting FIPS 201 Part 2 are interoperable. Participants will gain from the knowledge that their products are interoperable with other vendors’ offerings, and participants will increase their visibility with Federal agencies having an interest in FIPS 201 implementations. 

Note: The proposed revisions to FIPS 201 regarding the interim status indicator will not affect the PIV demonstrations.

The budgeted amount for the requirement is $24,000.00.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Services are needed for the review of regulatory packages under the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), and environmental analyses prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).The routing of documents through federal agencies for clearance, preparation for and transmittal to the Office of the Federal Register for publication is necessary to complete the process.  The division needs expert assistance familiar with preparation, routing and transmittal of MSA and NEPA documents and subsequent assemblage and transmittal of the official records for these actions.  Experience in working with federal agencies that impact the processing and transmittal of these packages is required.

Successful Headquarters’ review and publication of rules and environmental analyses requires familiarity with the type of action and the procedures used in preparation, routing, and transmittal to properly route the regulatory package through the review process.  Further, during this transition process, written procedures will be in flux and expertise will be needed in critiquing the written procedures and assisting in finalizing them for all types of regulatory packages.

Along with the change in procedures of regulatory packages will be a change in the handling of the official records of the action.  In addition to continued preparation of regulatory packages for archiving, the new procedures will require the expeditious preparation of the Headquarters’ portion of the official record and transmitting it to the regions for their permanent records.  Expertise is needed in developing and executing these new procedures.  The Domestic Fisheries Division now has a large backlog of completed regulatory actions that need to be consolidated into appropriate records files for permanent storage.  Retirement and reassignment of staff with the expertise necessary to fulfill these tasks could result in these records becoming dead files instead of properly stored.  Deliverables:  Progress reports must be delivered at two months, four months, and a final report at completion of the required tasks.  Payment will be made after receipt of each report.

The Period of Performance shall be approximately seven (7) months from the date of award.  The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price.

If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purpose of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<CONTACT>Rosa Harding, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 995-6037, Fax 301-995-8670, Email rosa.harding@navy.mil
<DESC>This Amendment is issued to answer questions in response to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation N00421-06-T-0083.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:    QUESTION 1.  Section 1:  There are three specified operating sites (USN Ships, USCG ships and USN/USCG shore installations).  Are DVLCE’s utilized in shore applications and DVLRS’ in shipboard applications? Are there any other site options that we should anticipate? If so, which system configuration is needed for the additional sites?   RESPONSE:  The DVLRS is intended for Navy shipboard applications only.  The DVLCE is suitable for USCG Shore and Cutter applications.  We know of no other site options.

QUESTION 2.  Section 3.1.1.1.e, 3.1.1.2.b, 3.1.1.4.b:  Does this mean that up to four analog audio signals mixed into one audio output feed playing synchronously with the video (if the video option is installed and part of the specific replay scenario)?  RESPONSE:  Yes.  A real-time playback scenario would include up to four combined (summed) audio circuits and a video output for the reconstruction of events for review or training purposes.

QUESTION 3.  Section 3.1.3.10:  Is the IRIG-E generated output requirement a DC level shift or modulated signal?   RESPONSE: It is a modulated 100 Hz carrier with a signal frame rate of 10 seconds and a resolution of 10ms.

QUESTION 4.  Section 3.2:  The DVLRS appears to have additional space available for system components. Can the DVLCE physical dimensions be exceeded as long it fits into the DVLRS cabinet and the DVLRS cabinet dimensions are conformed to?  RESPONSE:  The dimensions of the DVLCE must be in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.2 in order to retain compatibility with USCG shore facility and Cutter applications.

QUESTION 5.  Sections 3.2.1.d, 3.2.2.1.a and 3.2.2.2.a:  Serial ATA is accepted as a robust, fast and reliable data bus. Its performance is designed to compete with the various SCSI adaptations. You have accepted Serial ATA as a bus interface for the DVD-RAM drives. Is it acceptable in the RAID-1 hard drive arrays?  RESPONSE.  No.  Per SOW sections 3.2.1.d, 3.2.2.1.a and 3.2.2.2.a, the hard disk interface for the System drive array and the Wrap Around drive array shall be SCSI Ultra 320 or Serial Attached SCSI.  

QUESTION 6.  Section 3.2.1.f:  Please identify under what conditions, and in what operating sites, the DVLCE will operate in a stand-alone mode.  RESPONSE: At this time, the USCG shore communications facilities and Cutters.

QUESTION 7.  Section 3.2.2.3.j.1:  We provide the user with a selectable update to the DVD-RAM archiving drives. In our reliability testing over the years, we have found that buffering the data and then updating the DVD-RAM drives increases MTBF of the physical drives, thus reducing maintenance costs. Is this acceptable?  RESPONSE:  Per 3.2.2.3.j.1 and 3.2.2.3.j.2, the DVLCE shall be software user-configurable to:  (1)  Buffer a user selectable timeframe (per 3.2.2.3.j.2) to the Wrap-Around Drive, then record to the active archive drive…or (2)   Record directly to the media with out buffering (3.2.2.3.j.1).

QUESTION 8.  Section 3.2.5.3:  Under software control and configuration, we can identify two adjacent input channels as transmit and receive audio pairs, sum and record them to single channel (example: sum channels 1 & 2 and store the combined signal on channel 1). Is this an acceptable implementation for the SOW specification? If not, please explain how the DVLRS cabinet wiring, between the REAR INPUT/OUTPUT PANEL and the DVLCE is modified when 4 to 2 wire converters are required. Please clarify your requirement of up to four selectable channels. Is this four audio inputs combined to form two recording channels or eight audio inputs combined to form four recording inputs?  RESPONSE 1 of 2:  Per SOW paragraph 3.2.5.3, it is an acceptable implementation.  RESPONSE 2 of 2:  Per SOW paragraph 3.2.5.3, the DVLCE shall have the capability to sum/combine eight analog inputs into four DVLCE channels.  Example:  With shipboard high frequency radio systems, a typical full-duplex “Harbor Control” audio circuit consists of a separate receiver and transmitter, hence two separate audio pairs per full-duplex circuit.  The DVLCE shall be capable of summing/combining eight pairs from such circuits as “Harbor Control” into four of its input channels.

QUESTION 9.  Section 3.2.10.1:  Can the LCD / touch screen be located on the panel directly below the DVLCE, as long as the DVLRS dimension requirements are maintained and be a separate LCD display / touch screen in stand alone DVLCE installations?  RESPONSE: Per SOW 3.2.11.1, the display must be an integral part of the DVLCE front panel.

QUESTION 10.  Section 3.13:	FSK and RS-422 inputs/outputs are options. Are they mutually exclusive or will there be instances when both may be ordered as part of one DVLRS or DVLCE system?  RESPONSE: A shipboard DVLRS would be configured for one or the other interface, not both.  

QUESTION 11.  Section 3.13.1.1:  A. For the FSK input, what is the bit rate per second that the various tones will appear at the input?  B. What is the needed bit rate per second that the various tones need to appear at the FSK output?  C. What is the FSK output impedance specification requirement?  RESPONSE A: FSK communications is a navy target message format.  The Slow FSK message is an 88 bit serial message consisting of a sync pulse (2.4KHz) followed by ones (9.6KHz) and zeros (4.8KHz). The Fast FSK message is also an 88 bit serial message consisting of a sync pulse (12KHz) followed by ones (48KHz) and zeros (24KHz).  Both FSK data rates operate at 0 Vdc and 5.0 Vdc logic levels.  RESPONSE B: The FSK type at the output connector will be that of the archive being replayed, therefore its output could be fast or slow FSK.  RESPONSE C:  The FSK output must drive a 50 Ohm load.

QUESTION 12.  In order to properly gauge the amount of information submitted, with respect to the content/format for this solicitation, is a point-by-point compliance matrix to the SOW required, or simply a response with a general statement of compliance and including generic technical data all that is required?   RESPONSE:  A response with a general statement of compliance is required.

D) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Personnel; All data and information that is required in the performance of this task is unclassified, and a security clearance is not required in performance of this effort.  However, access to the White House Complex (including the New Executive Office Building and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) requires approval by the EOP Security and Emergency Preparedness Office (OSEP).  Approval is granted after suitability is determined by considering the results from a name check performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Contractors must allow ten working days prior to the projected start date for a name check to be processed and approved by the OSEP.  All Contractor personnel must be 18 years of age and U.S. citizens. Contractors are responsible for providing personnel who meet EOP personnel security requirements.  In this regard, contractors are expected to perform initial background checks of potential employees.  Failure to do so results in an unnecessary delay of beginning of contract performance; results in a waste of Government resources to do background checks on individuals who contractors should have pre-screened; may result in unfavorable past performance evaluations for the contractor, because of a failure to meet contract requirements; and may be a factor for evaluation of any award fees, if applicable. Contractor personnel who require access to the complex for longer than 90 days will also be required to undergo a full-field FBI investigation, and other background investigations as deemed appropriate.  Contractors must provide information to complete the full field background investigation within two weeks after their start date at the White House Complex or within two weeks of being notified that their work will extend for longer than a 90 day period.  Permanent access (beyond 90 days) is granted only after EOP OSEP review and approval of the results of the investigations.  Drug Testing; Pre-employment Testing; All Contractor employees may be required to pass a drug test prior to beginning work on the contract.  If required, the Contractor may either provide proof that employees passed a pre-employment drug test, or participate in a Government-sponsored testing program.  If the Contractor decides to participate in the Government program, OA, HRM Division will arrange for the drug test at no cost to the Contractor, and provide the results of such tests to the Contractor.  Random Testing; Consistent with FAR 52.223-6, Drug-Free Workplace, the Contractor shall randomly drug test personnel working on this contract in a manner equivalent to that covered in the EOP Drug-Free Workplace Plan.  If the Contractor does not have an existing random drug testing program, the Contractor must either establish a program or participate in the EOP Drug-Free Workplace Plan.  The EOP plan may be reviewed by arrangement with the Contracting Officer. At a minimum, the Contractor’s plan for random drug testing shall follow the procedures described in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing, effective September 1, 1994, as described in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs.  These programs are available on the Internet at http://www.workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/NatlLabCertPgm/MGuidelines.htm.  If the Contractor already has an existing random drug-testing program, the Contractor must submit a report of the number of employees tested on a random basis and the results of random 

E) SUBSTITUTION OF PERSONNEL:  The Contractor agrees to assign to the contract the key personnel (all personnel assigned to this contract, including substitutes), whose resumes and qualifications were submitted with the Contractor’s proposal and who are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the contract.  No substitutions shall be made except in accordance with this clause.  During the first 90 calendar days of the contract, the Contractor shall make no substitutions of key personnel unless the substitution is necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment.  Noncompliance with the provisions of this clause will be considered a material breech of the terms and conditions of the contract for which the Government may seek any and all appropriate remedies including termination.  Prior to removing, replacing, or diverting any of the specified individuals, the contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer (CO) and provide the information required below:  All proposed substitutions shall be submitted to the CO for approval at least 15 calendar days in advance of the proposed effective date (unless substitution is necessitated by sudden illness, death, or termination of employment in which case notice shall be within five (5) calendar days of the effective date) and must provide the information in (b) and (c) below.  All requests for substitutions shall be in writing unless otherwise agreed to by the CO and shall include a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information required by the CO to permit effective evaluation of the proposed substitution's qualifications.  Requests for substitution of "key personnel" above must also provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating it and sufficient information for the CO to evaluate the impact of the substitution on contract performance.
