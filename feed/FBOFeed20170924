<p>HCAA Local Clause 5001 - Non-Defense Health Agency (Non-DHA) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Business Associate Agreement (BAA) (7 July 2014)</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(2) and 164.504(e) and paragraph C.3.4.1.3 of DoD 6025.18-R, "DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation," January 24, 2003, this document serves as a BAA between the signatory parties for purposes of the HIPAA and the "HITECH Act" amendments thereof, as implemented by the HIPAA Rules and DoD HIPAA Issuances (both defined below). The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.</p>
<p>-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.</p>
<p>-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA.</p>
<p>-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD).</p>
<p>-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).</p>
<p>-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).</p>
<p>-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402.</p>
<p>-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules.<br /><br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.</p>
<p>I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.</p>
<p>(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement.</p>
<p>(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.</p>
<p>(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.</p>
<p>(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.</p>
<p>(f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.</p>
<p>(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.</p>
<p>(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and</p>
<p>(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.</p>
<p>(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.</p>
<p>(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.</p>
<p>(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.</p>
<p>III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions</p>
<p>(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity</p>
<p>The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.</p>
<p>V. Breach Response</p>
<p>(a) In general.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.</p>
<p>This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.</p>
<p>(b) Government Reporting Provisions</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate. <br /><br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US-CERT office.</p>
<p>The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.</p>
<p>When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.</p>
<p>(c) Individual Notification Provisions</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.</p>
<p>The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.</p>
<p>Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.</p>
<p>If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.</p>
<p>Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.</p>
<p>VI. Termination</p>
<p>(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.</p>
<p>(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.</p>
<p>(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VII. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:<br />Solicitation:<br />ITEM NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:<br />ITEM NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)<br />PART 12 - GENERAL EVALUATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection process. Award will be made to the responsible offeror on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Award may be made without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification). Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Paragraph (a) is hereby replaced with the following:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a single contract to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, is the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote. Technical Acceptability will be determined on the quoter's ability to meet the minimum requirement for all equipment as set forth above. The contract will be issued on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price. However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price quotations to ensure price reasonableness of the services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a Purchase Order without discussions. The Government reserves the right to enter into discussions if an unacceptable quote can be made acceptable.</p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>Correction:&nbsp; The place of performance is Harrison County, Mississippi.<br /><br />Synopsis: <br />This is a Market Research and Sources Sought Notice for information on capability and availability of potential contractors to harvest, grow, and install vegetative plantings and sand fencing on Ship Island as part of the Dune Construction Phase of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) Mississippi Barrier Island Restoration Project. Ship Island is located in the Mississippi Sound, approximately 13 miles south of Harrison County, Mississippi. The project work area is located within the boundaries of the National Park Service (NPS) Gulf Islands National Seashore (GUIS). The planting units and sand fence shall be installed on existing sandy fill material placed in the Camille Cut breach that separated East and West Ship Island (known as Camille Cut) to support habitat restoration and facilitate retention of the newly placed sand.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a solicitation announcement. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business firms. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, anticipates a future procurement to harvest, grow and install approximately 320,000 to 335,000 vegetative planting units and install approximately 17 miles of sand fence in staggered configurations.</p>
<p>The specific types of plants, and the approximate quantity of each, are listed in Table 1:</p>
<p>Table 1: Approximate plant quantities for Ship Island, MS Sources Sought solicitation.<br />Sea oats (Uniola paniculata) 90,000 - 95,000<br />Bitter panic grass (Panicum amarum) 140,000 - 145,000<br />Gulf bluestem (Schizachyrium maritimum) 90,000 - 95,000</p>
<p>The total cost to harvest, grow and install the number of plants shown in Table 1, fertilize/treat soil at the time of planting, and purchase and install sand fence arrays is expected to be approximately $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 (five to ten million dollars). Sources are being sought for firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $36.5 million.<br />METEOROLOGICAL BACKGROUND:<br /><br />Coastal Mississippi is characterized by a mild and humid climate. Coastal areas of Mississippi typically experience mild temperatures. The coldest air temperatures occur in January, and the warmest occur in July or August. Based on monitoring records of the Southeast Regional Climate Center (SRCC), the average maximum temperature in July varies from 89.6 to 90.9&ordm;F, and the average minimum temperature in January varies from 41.2 to 43.3&ordm;F. Localized variations in temperature occur due to the varied influences of proximity to the land/water interface. <br /><br />Long-term rainfall records maintained by SRCC for Gulfport, Biloxi, and Pascagoula document that the region receives in excess of 65 inches of rainfall annually, with monthly averages generally ranging from 5 to 6 inches. The highest monthly rainfall totals typically occur during July and August.<br /><br />The relatively even distribution of rainfall accumulations may be attributed to the occurrence and frequency of winter frontal storms balanced against thunderstorm events during the wetter, summer months. <br /><br />Prior characterizations of wind conditions in the project area indicate that prevailing nearshore surface winds are from the south from March to July, gradually shifting to more easterly in August and September. During the winter months, prevailing winds are from the north and are associated with frontal systems (USEPA, 1986). <br /><br />SPECIFIC PLANTING REQUIREMENTS:<br />All plants may be required to undergo inspection by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or any other Municipal, State, or Federal entities. <br /><br />Plants being transported across Mississippi state boundaries shall be inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and/or any other Municipal, State, or Federal entities upon leaving and re-entering the State of Mississippi.<br /><br />Plants shall be temporarily stockpiled and successfully installed in a barrier island environment that is void of a controlled water supply; however, plants will need to be watered immediately after installation. A slow release gel type fertilizer, water retention gel, and/or other appropriate soil treatment to be determined by USACE shall be required at the time of planting. Transportation of irrigation water and any equipment associated with the irrigation (sprayers, tanks, etc.) shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Installation of dune plantings shall occur between the months of November and March (during daylight hours).</p>
<p>Planting Unit Source, Option A<br />This option shall require that the source material for all planting units, except for sea oats, shall be limited to vegetative cuttings for plant propagation. Source material for sea oats shall be either seeds or vegetative cuttings. Plant stocks shall only be collected from the western and eastern portions of Ship Island, Sand Island (DA-10), and/or Horn Island, which are a part of the National Park Service (NPS) Gulf Islands National Seashore Barrier Islands in Mississippi. The term 'planting unit' is defined as a viable nursery grown plant installed into a hole with specified watering and fertilizer. Sufficient stands of the specified plants will be identified by an NPS and USACE representative prior to the contractor's mobilization for harvesting.<br /><br />Planting Unit Source, Option B<br />Under this option, the geographic origin of the plant stock supplied for this project shall be Mississippi, Alabama, the northwest panhandle of Florida, and/or southeast Louisiana. Plant stock originating outside of this geographical region may be considered for use if it has a proven track record of survivability and performance on projects with conditions similar to those that exist on Ship Island, Mississippi.</p>
<p>All efforts shall be made to utilize releases developed by the USDA-NRCS Plant Materials Program under this option. If a sufficient quantity of USDA-NRCS releases cannot be located to meet the requirements of this project, an equivalently performing plant adapted to Mississippi Gulf Coast conditions shall be utilized. USDA-NRCS tested plant material releases identified for this project are &lsquo;Caminada' Germplasm Sea Oats, &lsquo;Fourchon' Germplasm Bitter Panicum, and &lsquo;Timbalier' Germplasm Gulf Bluestem. Plants growing within the fill template of the project shall not be harvested by the Contractor. Seeds collected specifically to supply plant stock for this project shall be collected from lands that are managed/permitted by a State or Federal Agency. Under this option, the harvesting of native plants for this project or for future use shall in no way increase the cost of the project to the Government above what a typical job of this magnitude would cost if all of the plants were obtained through commercial sources. <br /><br />Planting Unit Size Requirements <br />Sea Oats shall have at least five (5) stems that meet the specified stem length requirement. Stem lengths shall be greater than twelve (12) inches. Sea Oats shall be provided in 4-inch pots with a root ball that fills the pot but is not root bound.</p>
<p>Gulf Bluestem plants shall have a 12-24 inch stem length. Plants must have at least two (2) live stems that meet the specified stem length requirement.</p>
<p>Bitter Panicum potted plants shall have a six (6) inch minimum stem length with a minimum of two (2) nodes. Rooted cuttings (runners or tillers) with an upper shoot shall also be acceptable.</p>
<p>Sea Oats, Gulf Bluestem, and Bitter Panic shall have a root ball with a volume of approximately six (6) cubic inches unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Sand Fencing<br />The sand fence material shall have a fence porosity (defined as the ratio of the open area to the total projected area of the fence) between 40% and 60%. The sand fence assembly shall be 4 feet in height with slats spaced 1.75 inches (+- 0.25 inches) or as necessary to meet the specified porosity requirements. Sand fence slats shall be 2 inches wide by 3/8 inch thick. Sand fence wood slats (pickets) shall be decay free, unpainted and untreated, #1 Aspen, Cedar, or Spruce wood. <br /><br />Wooden posts for fence support shall be at least 3 inches in diameter and made from untreated, unpainted black locust, spruce or cedar. Wooden support posts shall be at least 8 feet long and shall be set at least 4 feet in the sand and no further than 10 feet apart. Wooden support posts shall be decay free, unpainted, and untreated.<br />Wire, nails, and staples used in the manufacture and installation of the sand fence shall be galvanized. Sand fence shall be manufactured with 14-gauge wire. <br /><br />Warranty Criteria<br />The contractor shall warrant all planting units for a period of 365 days from the end of the planting installation and acceptance by the Government. A survival rate of at least 80% within each acceptance section shall be required for this project. In addition to warranty survival, any planting unit that does not survive ten (10) days immediately after installation shall be replaced. <br /><br />Sand fence shall be warranted for replacement due to faulty craftsmanship and/or installation. Sand fence shall be inspected, and faulty units replaced as necessary, twice within the 365 day warranty period.<br /><br />Access Considerations for Harvesting<br />The use of a UTV or other motorized equipment may be limited during plant stock harvesting. Boat access may be restricted to piers and docks managed by the NPS on the western end of Ship Island and on Horn Island. Draft limitations and seasonal conditions may apply and should be considered for the eastern end of Ship Island and Sand Island (DA-10). <br /><br />Environmental Considerations<br />The presence of sea grass beds in the vicinity of the project work area should be considered and may limit boat access within the GUIS boundaries. The Contractor shall be required to comply with all applicable State and Federal permit terms. Harvesting and construction activities shall be subject to seasonal and migratory restrictions for threatened and endangered species and environmental monitoring may be required. Additional conditional restrictions may be imposed by the NPS and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).
