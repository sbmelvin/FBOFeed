<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT The U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Office (DOE/ORO) intends to award a sole source contract to the HUBZone small business concern, Haselwood Services & Manufacturing, Inc., Oliver Springs, Tennessee,  FAR Part 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.   The proposed NAICS code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract is for technical expertise and administrative support to assist the Assistant Manager for Nuclear Fuel Supply in the oversight of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) operation of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) as stated in Article 2 of the â€œAgreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and USEC, Inc.,â€ dated June 17, 2002.  The contractor will provide support to (1) assess USECâ€™s operation of the PGDP for production levels equal to or in excess of 3.5 Million Separative Work Units (3.5 MM SWU) per year and that the PGDP is capable of operating at 5.5 MM SWU per year at the required product assay, and ensure that a minimum of 150 cells are capable of operation, and (2) oversight of the cascade cells, cooling towers, pipelines to cooling towers, switch yards, seal shop, Freon supply, barrier, spare parts, spare materials, and general maintenance, and ensure that all critical systems, minimum of 34, are capable of performing their intended function.  Other areas may be monitored as requested by DOE. Haselwood Services & Manufacturing, Inc., is considered to be the only HUBZone small business concern that can perform this requirement, based on current market research.  This contractor has provided the required technical expertise and administrative support for a number of years and its personnel possess the knowledge base and experience to perform the required oversight of USEC operation of the PGDP.  The PGDP utilizes a complex technology which involves a diversity of processes.  In order to assess USECâ€™s operation of the PGDP for production levels equal to or in excess of 3.5 MM SWU per year and the capability of the PGDP to operate at 5.5 MM SWU per year at the required product assay, technical expertise and a broad overall knowledge of plant operation and production processes is required in many different engineering and management disciplines.  The compacted time frames required for delivery of the products of this effort require that the project be staffed with knowledgeable personnel with the experience and capability to understand overall plant operation, the DOE mission, and the existing regulatory framework. Any HUBZone firm who wants to challenge the proposed sole-source award must submit an interest letter that demonstrates its ability to provide an equivalent service as described above, and rationale why they should be considered.  All interest letters must be received by 8:00 AM April 8, 2005, via email to ahlersdd@oro.doe.gov or via facsimile to (865) 241-2549.  It is the firmâ€™s responsibility to confirm DOE receipt of its interest letter. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract award based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No reimbursement of any costs associated with providing this capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>In November 2005 the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intends to publish a Request for Proposals seeking offers for the provision of services of hazardous waste removal/disposal contractors who are qualified to perform the “duties of generator” of hazardous waste on behalf of law enforcement agencies, and to properly manage the hazardous waste seized by law enforcement at various waste generating activities.  It is the DEA’s expectation that such support will be procured from multiple contractors for a base period of one year with four one Year Options.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 – Set-Asides for Small Businesses it is necessary for the Contracting Officer to obtain the information required to aid the DEA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside this procurement for small business or whether to conduct only a full and open competition.  

In order to make this determination the DEA requires the following information in from interested vendors:

1. Capability Statement – The document should identify past performance references for the last 3 years for work performed of a similar type.  (Limited to 5 pages)
2. Resumes – These should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as the Chemist(s), and Recovery Technician(s). in a future proposal to a request for proposals.
3. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.)

Attached is the present working copy of the Statement of Work for the upcoming request for proposals and necessary DEA security provisions for personnel.  Please review these documents to ensure your companies capabilities and interest in abiding by these requirements prior to responding to this survey.  Further attached are the qualification requirements for a Chemist and a Recovery Technician.

This Sources Sought notice is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise to contract by the Government.  This posting does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.

A vendor’s failure to respond to this posting does not necessitate that vendor’s exclusion from the upcoming competition.

However, the failure of adequate and appropriate small business participation in this survey will result in the release of only a full and open competition.  

In the event of adequate and appropriate small business response to this survey the DEA will be releasing two requests for proposal.  One will be a request for proposal conducted as a full and open competition and the other will be a request for proposal conducted as a small business set-aside.  Two requests for proposal will be necessary to ensure adequate service coverage of a significant portions of the United States.
Please submit your response to this sources sought announcement to Mr. Paul Osterhaus by the date identified above.

<DESC>Architect-Engineer Services for Repairs and Alterations at the IRS Services Center, Andover, MA.  Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. Project is required to be designed to facility standards as outlined in PBS-P100, “Facilities Standards for the Public Building Service, March 2005 issue”.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals, current security requirements, and will be designed in metric units. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is for major repairs and alterations to the IRS Service Center in Andover, MA in accordance with General Services Administration (GSA) quality standards and requirements. It is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Boston right off of Interstate 93. The building is approximately 400,500 gross square feet, situated on 36 acres and has an outside parking lot for 1,725 automobiles. The main facility was constructed in 1966 and additional wings were added to facility in 1969. The existing structure is a brick-faced concrete and steel construction. It is a single story building with mechanical penthouses. This project will be a model workplace that utilizes sustainable design and is responsive to the existing character of the building. This modernization project shall follow guidelines for LEED NC format and will incorporate a total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides and standards.  
GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services.  The CMc will be part of the design team during the design process to provide construction expertise; cost management services; market, labor and material cost information; and constructability reviews.  Upon exercise of the construction phase option, the CMc will provide complete construction services. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, environmental, life cycle costing, and related consulting services for repairs and alterations at the Andover Service Center. The scope of work will require at a minimum:  concept design documents, design development documents, construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), web-based project management services, and post-construction contract services (PCCS)(Option to be exercised at a later date) for an existing facility.  The project includes repair and alteration of an existing office building and related building systems; client program requirements for renovation of all tenant areas, restrooms and entrance lobbies; upgrading accessibility to meet the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards(ABAAS); structural upgrades for current seismic and wind load requirements; correction of codes deficiencies; abatement of hazardous materials (asbestos containing materials and lead paint); renovation of the main lobby; upgrading of plumbing, fire protection, mechanical and electrical systems, and security; and any other design work deemed necessary to implement the concepts developed during previous renovation studies. Space alterations include raised flooring, interior lighting, and telephone and data access for a flexible workplace. The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the PBS-P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.  It is anticipated that construction work will be accomplished in phases, therefore, the A/E will be required to develop a detailed phasing plan in conjunction with the Government and associated contractors. The A/E will be expected to work closely with GSA, client agencies, and the project team in coordinating and planning a successful project outcome.

<DESC>This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is posted to allow the General Services Administration (GSA) the opportunity to announce its intent to solicit for qualified General Construction Contractors (GC) for a new security screening station and separation wall in the lobby of the US Post Office & Courthouse building in Gainesville, Fl.  The security station portion of this work will entail the construction of cabinetry and counter space complete with bullet proofing measures as required by the US Marshals Service.  The separation wall will be an integral part of the security station and is designed to be constructed using a tube steel frame clad with aluminum and glass.  As a means of egress/ingress through the separation wall, two frameless glass doors are proposed.  This project will include some electrical relocation and installation as well as the installation of a magnetic locking scheme on the two new doors.  There will also be a certain amount of repair to the floors and walls where the current security station is to be removed.  This project is proposed to provide, not only a better aesthetic first impression within the lobby, but also to provide increased security and functionality to the building.  
The Federal Building Courthouse is located at 401 S.E. First Ave., Gainesville, FL.   Construction is scheduled to start on or before December 2005, with a completion date of no later than February 2006.  The estimated dollar amount of the project is between $60,000 and $80,000. The project completion is approximately 45 calendar days after issuance of the Notice to Proceed. Bonds, Insurance and Security Clearances will be required prior to the start of any work.  The technical factors to be evaluated are: 1) Organization Approach (40 points), offeror to submit a management plan describing how they propose to accomplish the work required in the RFP. 2) Qualifications of Key Personnel (30 points), offeror to submit narrative descriptions of education, training and experience of each of the personnel which demonstrate their ability to successfully perform the work required under this Request for Proposal (RFP). 3) Experience and Past Performance of Offeror (30 points), offeror to submit narrative descriptions of three (3) related projects, performed within the last three (3) years, which demonstrate offeror’s ability to successfully perform the work required under the RFP. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (iaw) FAR Part 15.101-a (2).  This procurement will be advertised on a restricted basis as a Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220 with a Small Business Size Standard of $27.5 million.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract to Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc for a one-year period for Maintenance and Technical Manipulation of Rabbits at NIH, Bethesda, MD. Care of rabbits will be in accordance with current animal welfare regulations and policies.  Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1. NIAID has been conducting a long-term breeding and immunization experiment, for several years to study the development of autoimmunity in rabbit models of the human autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  The colony of genetically defined pedigreed rabbits, animals being used in this experiment, and the inbred rabbits being maintained are important resources for current and future NHGRI rabbit genome sequencing.  The stress of moving these animals would seriously negate several years of experimental studies now in progress and would impact on the final results of the study. For this reason, Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc has been identified as the only responsible source for this requirement.  If you have any questions or comments please respond in writing to Carolyn Wilder at cwilder@niaid.nih.gov on or before June 27, 2005 at 2:00 pm EDT. See Number Note 22.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Mahmoudi, Responsable des Achats et Approvisionnement, Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM), 34, Avenue Al Fadila, 10050, Rabat, Morocco. Phone: (212) 37-23-80-87, Fax: (212) 37-28-16-17.  Morocco: Geographic Information System Procurement Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to support the procurement and implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based Information Technology (IT) system for the exploration and production of oil, natural gas, hydrocarbon, and other minerals in Morocco.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided a grant to the Grantee, the Moroccan Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM), to fund the cost of Technical Assistance to support the implementation of a project developed in a previous USTDA-funded feasibility study.  In 2002, USTDA provided a $399,880 grant to the Office National de Recherches et d’Exploitations Pétrolières (ONAREP), the national petroleum development company of Morocco, to fund a Geographic Information System and Information Technology Feasibility Study (USTDA Activity Number 2001-10021D).  On July 8, 2003, ONAREP and its sister organization Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (BRPM), which is responsible for metal and mineral enterprises, were merged into ONHYM, which became the Grantee for that activity.  The Feasibility Study Final Report was completed by the U.S. Contractor, Computational Geosciences, Inc. (Norman, OK), in August 2003 and ONHYM would now like to proceed with the procurement of equipment based on the favorable findings in the CGI Feasibility Study Final Report.

ONHYM is a public organization under the administrative supervision of Morocco’s Ministry of Energy and Mines, with a mandate of coordinating and managing all activities related to exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Morocco.  It explores for oil and natural gas in Morocco, and operates small onshore gas/condensate fields.  In addition, ONHYM is responsible for foreign investment promotion, including attracting U.S. oil companies.  ONHYM negotiates the terms of reconnaissance (seismic) contracts and petroleum agreements, and applies jointly with its partners (foreign oil companies) for exploration and production licenses and permits.  It also maintains all available geophysical data and offers it to interested outside companies free of charge.

ONHYM has initiated work on various recommendations of the CGI Feasibility Study Final Report, including data collection at both ONAREP and BRPM, and hardware and software acquisitions and upgrades.  ONHYM requested USTDA support in implementing the recommendations of the CGI Feasibility Study Final Report for a national Geographic Information System (GIS)-based Information Technology (IT) system for the exploration and production of oil, natural gas, hydrocarbon, and other minerals.  The GIS IT system project is called “Systeme D’Information de Exploration et de la Production Miniere et Petroliere” (SIEPMP).  

With the completion of the CGI Feasibility Study Final Report under USTDA funding, Technical Assistance is viewed as necessary to implement the SIEPMP project.  The CGI Feasibility Study Final Report would be used as the basis for drafting the tender documents needed to comply with international competitive bidding procedures.  This Technical Assistance would allow ONHYM to implement the SIEPMP project on a timely basis, using transparent contractor selection processes.

The CGI Feasibility Study Final Report states that a GIS would modernize and integrate data management to improve ONHYM’s exploration and production activities.  The implementation of a modern GIS-based information management system for petroleum and natural gas exploration and production in Morocco is essential in order for ONHYM to achieve its corporate objectives in a competitive 21st century environment.   The technologies are similar to those in widespread use throughout the international petroleum industry.  The following are other important considerations for this project:

·	As an operating oil company, ONHYM must seek to optimize its performance in an efficient manner.  It needs the technology tools sufficient to conduct competent geotechnical, production, and cost related analysis in support of its program activities in the field.  It also requires the ability to move effectively that information to various areas of the company to support financial and planning requirements on a timely basis.   

·	As the local partner of foreign enterprises investing in the upstream petroleum sector in Morocco, ONHYM has an obligation to provide them with reliable information, and the requirement to receive such information on a timely and as needed basis.

·	As a promoter of hydrocarbon exploration and production licensing in Morocco, ONHYM needs a mechanism that allows it to digitally generate data packages and related material directly from its own internal databases.

This Technical Assistance would provide ONHYM with assistance through the procurement process for the SIEPMP project, to ensure it is properly implemented.  The proposed GIS IT procurement by ONHYM in Morocco is the next sequential step in fully implementing the recommendations of the USTDA-funded CGI Feasibility Study Final Report.

The Technical Assistance will consist of the following tasks: 1) Project Preparation; 2) Tender Preparation; 3) Tender Launching; 4) Contract Preparation and Validation; 5) Project Implementation (Accompaniment); 6) Training of Grantee Staff of GIS/IT Technology; and 7) Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $115,000 grant to the Grantee from U.S. Trade and Development Agency.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon, November 21, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Such product(s) are "exact product(s)" as defined in "DLAD 52.217-9002, conditions for evaluation and acceptance of offers for part numbered items."   A vendor offer/quotation, "bid without exception," is a certification that the "exact product," manufactured by one of the entities cited in the PID will be furnished under the contract or order. Any product manufactured by other than one of the entities cited in the PID is an "alternate product," even though it might be manufactured in accordance with the drawing(s) and/or specifications of one of the entities cited in the PID.  If an alternate product is furnished under a contract or order for an exact product, the alternate product will be an unauthorized substitution, and may yield criminal penalties in addition to any civil remedies available to the government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>1. 	PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project consists of reconstructing 3.8 miles of the Indian Creek Road (FSR 70042). The reconstructed road standard will be upgraded from a 1 ½ lane improved native surface to a double lane road with a 30-foot wide subgrade and 8-inch depth of crushed aggregate base surfacing. Existing portions of road to be relocated will include full recontouring and restoration to match adjacent topography.  Work will include construction staking; clearing and grubbing; excavation and embankment of unclassified material; treatment of existing road surface; removal and salvage of existing government property; and furnishing and installing and/or placing cross drainage structures, gates, cattle guards, crushed aggregate base (commercial source), fence and seeding. 

Optional advertised items may include developing gravel pit and producing crushed aggregate base surfacing (substitute for commercially available aggregate) and relocating the existing Indian Springs Road (FSR #70501) to upland location (approximately 2.0 miles). The road standard for the Indian Springs Road will be a single lane with turnouts, a 17-foot wide subgrade, and native surfacing accomplished via linear grading. Work would also include full obliteration and restoration of existing road template (approximately 1.4 miles) to match existing adjacent topography.

Show-me trip will meet at the Sheep Creek Snowpark at the intersection of Sheep Creek Road (FSR #70051) and Indian Creek Road (FSR #70042). Access from Spanish Fork is east 25 miles on State Highway 6 to Sheep Creek-Rays Valley Road (FSR #70051) and north 8 miles to Indian Creek Road (FSR #70042). Access from Heber is southeast 25 miles on State Highway 40 to West Side Strawberry Road (FSR#70131), south 14 miles to Indian Creek Road (FSR #70042), and southwest 16 miles to Sheep Creek Road.

<SUBJECT>B -- UAV Battlelab Dynamic Spectrum Management and Allocation Tool Broad Agency Announcement FY05
<SOLNBR>BAA-UAVB-05-003
<RESPDATE>100605
<ARCHDATE>10212005
<CONTACT>David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA UAVB 05-0003) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION TOOL CAPABILITY.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

A software-based tool is needed to assist in frequency management and coordination in a dynamic environment.  As Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) proliferate the battlespace, lack of available spectrum is becoming a critical issue.  The traditional way that Joint-level spectrum managers allocate and deconflict frequency assignments is largely a static process and inefficient.  A dynamic process is needed to allow the sharing and re-use of frequencies on a mission-by-mission, day-by-day basis, e.g., through an ATO-like process.  Rather than have spectrum assigned "permanently" to (and owned by) a particular unit, units should receive frequencies as needed based on the specific requirements for a given mission.  The spectrum resources should be managed/controlled/coordinated in a similar manner as that which currently exists for managing the airspace.  The system needs to be flexible enough to factor in mission locations, en-route/egress flight paths, mission altitudes, TX range requirements, frequency congestion areas, etc.  If an RPA unit stands down for WX outage, the frequency bandwidth they normally need should be available for use by other RPA platforms.   When the RPA is on-station over the target area, the frequencies needed during takeoff at the FOL 300 miles away should be temporarily marked as available for other users. The UAV Battlelab is interested in any systems that would be able to perform this dynamic spectrum management and allocation function.

The NVCD system must be capable of both Wide and  Narrow Field-of-View (W/NFOV) night vision.  The NVCD system configured in  either the W/NFOV configuration is called a Night Display Unit (NDU) and is  for use on USAF F-15, F-16, and possibly Navy F/A-18 JHMCS equipped aircraft.   The NVCD will be required to receive a safe-to-fly certification before first  flight and receive airworthiness before entering production.  The NVCD system  should interface with the -21, –22, and future variances of JHMCS Electronics  Units (EU) (to include the Dual Seat EU and -30 EU currently in design) and  all OFP versions from 5.0, 6.4, 7.0 and future variances which will be  controlled by the JHMCS Joint Interface Control Working Group (JICWG).   Contract awardees will be required to be members of the JICWG.  No changes to  the JHMCS can be made to complete the required integration. 2.  The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Fighter Attack Systems Wing, Combat  Systems Squadron (FASW/CBSS) intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)  contract to two offerors willing to provide – four(4) NVCD system weight and  space mockups for flight safety testing, six (6) NVCD systems for operational  flight test, flight test support, a priced option for six (6) additional NVCD  systems for follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (OT+E), and a priced  production option for a minimum of 5 and maximum of 200 units with price  points at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.  Please note this  document falls under "DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to  Department of Defense and DOD Contractors only to protect technical or  operational data..."  To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email  request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson,  by COB 18 March 2005.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Provide all labor, equipment, tools, supplies, transportation, supervision, quality control, and management necessary to perform magazine and inert building maintenance and repairs at the Naval Support Activity (NSA Crane), Crane, Indiana, by means of an indefinite quantity type contract with a guaranteed minimum of $50,000.00 per 12-month period. The total contract maximum is $10 million.   The solicitation contains provisions for a 12-month base period, plus two 12-month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  The term of the contract shall not exceed 36 months or the total value of the contract shall not exceed $10.0 million, whichever comes first.  

The solicitation is for all work associated with magazine and inert building maintenance and repairs including but not limited to concrete installation and removal, replacement of entire or portions of concrete docks, replacement of entire or portions of wing walls, replacement of steel doors, lead paint removal, replacement of dead lights, dome repair and replacement, grounding, seeding, mulching, removal and installation of bumper blocks, excavation, backfilling, and incidental related work.  New magazine and inert building construction is not included. While it is the Government’s intent to utilize the contract resulting from this solicitation to accomplish magazine and inert building maintenance and repairs, the Government does not guarantee any work beyond the guaranteed minimum of $50,000.00. 

SEED PROJECT.  As part of the initial proposal, the contractor shall provide both a cost proposal and brief performance narrative for various repairs at five (5) separate magazines.  Work at these magazines may include repair and restoration of earth cover, the removal and replacement of concrete wing walls, the removal and replacement of magazine doors, installation of lexan covers over existing glass blocks, and/or removal and replacement of concrete loading docks.  The contractor shall use the unit pricing that is provided by the contractor within the schedule of estimated work (Exhibit Line Items) for determining the total cost of the seed project.  The seed project will be the first task order issued on this contract and will count towards meeting the guaranteed minimum for the base period.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract to Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc for a one-year period for Maintenance and Technical Manipulation of Rabbits at NIH, Bethesda, MD. The contact will contain the following clause FAR 52.219-8, Option to Extend Services. Care of rabbits will be in accordance with current animal welfare regulations and policies.  Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1. NIAID has been conducting a long-term breeding and immunization experiment, for several years to study the development of autoimmunity in rabbit models of the human autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  The colony of genetically defined pedigreed rabbits, animals being used in this experiment, and the inbred rabbits being maintained are important resources for current and future NHGRI rabbit genome sequencing.  The stress of moving these animals would seriously negate several years of experimental studies now in progress and would impact on the final results of the study. For this reason, Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc has been identified as the only responsible source for this requirement.  If you have any questions or comments please respond in writing to Carolyn Wilder at cwilder@niaid.nih.gov on or before June 27, 2005 at 2:00 pm EDT. See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional information for the topic "Technology to Develop an Ambient Temperature Specimen Transport System" as follows:

1)  Would it be reasonable to assume the "ambient temperature," that temperature we are trying to keep the sample at, to be 15 degrees C - 25 degrees C?  If a tighter range is required it is important that we know that.

Answer:  Ambient temps should be 15 degrees – 30 degrees C.

2)  What would you consider to be "inexpensive" for transporting medical samples?  Would $30-50 per use of the specialized container when in full manufactured quantities be reasonable?

Answer:  The cost should be less than $50 per use.

3)  Can you give examples of the sample/specimen container -- a micro-centrifuge tube (1ml volume) or a 15 cc blood vial, glass or plastic?  For accessing the biohazard level, is it safe to assume the specimen may be blood?  What type(s) of medical samples will be transported?  The solicitation specifies only "nucleic acid amplification assays."  What type of container? (plastic, glass?); what volume? what type of seal (snap, screw top?); what is the sample?  (nucleic acid within saliva, blood, urine, or an oral cavity swab?).    

Answer:  The container should be plastic (similar to nunc freezer vials), 1 ml–10 ml volume size.  The samples could be nucleic acids within saliva, blood, urine, or an oral cavity.  The seal for the vial should be an o-ring type with a gasket for specimen containment.

No other terms or conditions are changed by reason of this amendment.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment #1:  Answers to Technical Questions Question #1   How large is the chamber that will be used with this system? Answer (1):  The chamber has a volume of 317 L Question #2   The system specs for concentration and T/RH control seem very tight.  Are these true  requirements? Answer (2):  As far as temperature control, the system needs to monitor T, but not control it.  The EPA will control the temperature within the chamber.  The EPA's preference is for a system with the tightest control on this concentration, the closer to +/- 0.1 mg/L the better due to  the kinetic experiments planned.  The relative humidity can slip to 5%, but again the EPA's preference is for the tightest control of RH possible.  See revised specs below: 	measure ClO2 gas concentration to within +/- 0.1 mg/L and control the concentration  	within a 317 L chamber to within +/-  0.3 mg/L of a preset value ?	measure temperature of the ClO2/N2 gas stream to within +/- 0.3 oC  ?	measure relative humidity of the ClO2/N2 gas stream to within +/- 3 % and control  	relative humidity constant to within +/- 5 % of a preset value within a 317 L chamber ?	measure pressure within an  enclosure to within +/- 1 % of full scale ?	include programmable logic control to maintain ClO2 concentration and RH in a chamber  ?	be able to be operator programmed to control relative humidity and monitor temperature  	conditions within the following ranges: 	o	temperature from 60 to 95  oF 	o	relative humidity from 40 to 90 % The due date for quotes remains unchanged (10/11/05) Chlorine Dioxide Gas Generation System with Precision Concentration Control This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334516.  The specifications for the Chlorine Dioxide Gas Generation System with Precision  Concentration Control are as follows: The system must have the following specifications: "	include instrumentation that will provide precise and accurate real time monitoring of ClO2 concentration, pressure, temperature and relative humidity "	measure and control ClO2 gas concentration to within  +/- 0.1 mg/L of a preset value "	measure and control temperature of the ClO2/N2 gas stream to within +/- 0.3 oC of a preset value "	measure relative humidity of the ClO2/N2 gas stream to within +/- 3 % and control relative humidity constant to within +/- 3 % of a preset value "	measure pressure  within an enclosure to within +/- 1 % of full scale "	include programmable logic control to maintain ClO2 concentration, RH, and temperature in a chamber  "	be able to be operator programmed to control temperature and relative humidity conditions within the following ranges: o	temperature from 60  to 95 oF o	relative humidity from 40 to 90 % "	generate ClO2 using the dry process which produces ClO2 from reaction between chlorine gas (Cl2) in nitrogen and solid reactant such as sodium chlorite; no liquid chemicals are to be used in the ClO2 generation process "	be able to generate a gas  concentration of 100 mg/L with a throughput of 20 LPM  and a maximum input concentration of Cl2 gas of 2% Cl2/N2 "	not have feed gas concentration exceeding 2 % Cl2 in N2 due to laboratory constraints "	provide 100 % conversion of the inlet Cl2 into ClO2 "	be portable "	have automated test  condition cycling  "	have a user friendly interface for programming and operation control "	have the ability to easily program and keep in system memory multiple test conditions/cycles  "	have easy to replace solid reactant (e.g., reactant contained in a cartridge) "	have detailed, real time data  logging/reporting/trending in a format that can be incorporated into readily available software such MS Excel "	be listed and labeled by a third party listing agency approved by the North Carolina Building Code Council (NCBCC).

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Invitation to Provide Land Command and Control Systems (LC2S) Demonstrations on National Land C2 Systems
<DESC>In accordance with NATO Infrastructure Committee authorization for Land Command and Control Information Services (LC2IS), the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) invited its member delegations to arrange demonstrations of the functional capabilities of existing National Land C2 systems at a National Land C2 System Workshop. To clarify the guidelines and logistical arrangements for the Workshop, an Information Day was conducted by the NC3A in Brussels on the 1st of September.

The NC3A recognizes that because of the tight schedule, some firms were unable to participate in the workshop. Those firms that could not participate but are still interested in demonstrating a National Land C2 system are invited to schedule individual demonstrations at NC3A, The Hague, Netherlands, for the period up to 15th November. The firms must first be declared eligible to participate by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Papers with information on the functional and technical capabilities of National Land C2 systems are also welcome by 15 November 2005.

ELIGIBILITY

The contracting entity for these demonstrations is the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A). Firms that would like to schedule an individual LC2S demonstration must first receive a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Only firms that the U.S. Department of Commerce has declared eligible will be allowed to schedule a demonstration with the NC3A. A Declaration of Eligibility will be submitted on their behalf to the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, which will in turn provide the Declaration of Eligibility to NC3A.

You may request from the U.S. Department of Commerce a copy of the Bi-SC AIS Target Architecture Engineering Methodology for describing National Land Command Control Systems to help you in preparing your demonstration. 

Firms that have received a Declaration of Eligibility to provide a demonstration to the NC3A may then schedule that demonstration by contacting Mr. Xavier Desfougeres. Tel: +32-(0)2-707-8296; Fax: +32-(0)2-707-8770; Email: Xavier.desfougeres@nc3a.nato.int.

<SUBJECT>R -- Detention Services Schedule Program RFI
<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) is interested in new and innovative solutions to meet its future goals of establishing a Detention Services Schedule Program.  This RFI is designed to obtain information from industry regarding suggested approaches, new technology and applications.  This RFI will acquire information concerning potential solutions, services, and support that the private sector can offer to achieve these goals.  In addition to detention services, the program will require other services such as: secure detention transportation (national and local), the use of secure modular units designed for detention, guard services (armed and unarmed), and emergency contingency options.  The Detention Service Schedule program will provide United States Marshal Service (USMS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) with a simplified process of acquiring detention or correctional services in varying quantities while obtaining volume discounts. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal.  The purpose of this RFI is to afford private industry the opportunity to comment and discuss any perceived issues and to allow the Government to receive benefit from these comments.  Responses to this RFI may be considered in the preparation of any subsequent RFP and/or budgeting purposes.  OFDT will have interchange meetings with industry representatives to share information, views, and opinions.  These interchange meetings will be held on an individual basis and conducted in Washington, DC.  OFDT has set aside 2-hour time blocks during the period of October 24, 2005 to November 4, 2005, at OFDT Washington, DC offices.  If travel to Washington, DC is not feasible interested parties may submit written comments by November 15, 2005. Comments will not be critiqued and the interchange meetings should NOT be used by sources to market individual services or supplies. The Government does NOT intend to pay for the information solicited and shall NOT recognize any costs being associated with this initiative. Proprietary information is not being solicited and information considered proprietary should be clearly as PROPERIETARY INFORMATION. This RFI is the first step in a multi-phased procurement process. OFDT expects to subsequently issue a DRAFT RFP for industry comment.  Eligibility to participate in any future acquisition does not depend on a response to this notice. All interested parties should contact Ginny Parsons at Ginny.A.Parsons@usdoj.gov or 
Janet.Morris@usdoj.gov. Appointment times will be on first-come, first-serve basis.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for A digital photogrammetry system to be used for conducting extremely accurate three-dimendsional (3D) coordinate system measurements of large inflatable and rigid antennas. Aperture sizes ranging from 1 meter up to 12 meters are anticipated. These measurements will be used to determine the root-mean square (RMS) surface accuracy of the antennas by comparing the coordinates to ideal or best fit curved surfaces. The system shall obtain dimensional information about the antenna using triangulation to provide 3D coordinates based on photographs taken from different viewing directions using a high resolution digital camera.  The following specifications are required: 1. System measurement accuracy of at least 0.1 mm on a 12 meter antenna. 2. The system shall be capable of obtaining this accuracy on specular as well as low emissivity surfaces. 3. The system shall operate properly in an unstable environment. For example, the photographs shall be able to be taken from a man-lift, subject to vibration, without impairing measurement accuracy. 4. The system shall be capable of performing surface analysis on dynamic targets. For example, the antennas may be tested in thermal environments which would cause the surface to deform on relatively small time scales (e.g. tens of seconds). The system shall still be able to accurately map the surface under these conditions.  5. The camera system shall be easily portable and battery operated. (The system will be used in various antenna ranges as well as confined or remote locations.) 6. Images shall be exportable in IGES format.  7. The camera shall include an integrated automatic strobe system. 8. The camera shall be capable of wireless (802.11b) Ethernet connection.  9. The camera shall include integrated lasers to facilitate aiming. 10. CCD (sensor) resolution shall be 8 mega pixels or better.  11. The system shall include all processing software to render 3D images of the antenna under test. The software shall include a geometrical analysis package to create geometric components (e.g., circles, planes, lines) and determine distances as well as the ability to create best fit prime focus and offset paraboloids.  12. Ultimately, NASA intends to conduct measurements in a thermal-vacuum environment to determine solar heating induced surface deformations. The system shall have no inherent limitations preventing operation in a vacuum environment. That is, the system shall be upgradeable to work in a thermal-vacuum chamber.  13. The system shall include necessary retro-reflective targets and NIST traceable scales for verifying dimensions. 14. The vendor shall provide a complete system instruction manual. 15. On-site training, which shall take place at NASA GRC, in all aspects of system operation for at least three people shall be included. Training shall commence not later than 1 week after delivery of system to NASA GRC.  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-05.
