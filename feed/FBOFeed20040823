We have planned a day of good old-fashioned merry-making and entertainment sure to bring a smile to even the most forlorn face.  So that you may share in this festive and worthwhile endeavor, Edwards AFB invites you to join in the spirit of the season and participate as a commercial sponsor.  Sponsorship is an essential element for the continuation and success of programs such as this, and we are requesting your company’s support.  Sponsorship is contributed in the form of monetary and/or in-kind contributions. As a return on your investment, your company may receive unprecedented recognition in the form of audio, print and visual media coverage. Sponsor exposure, with varying sponsorship levels, may include name/logo recognition, brochures, media coverage, feature articles, photo opportunities, posters, and will be prominently acknowledged throughout the event.  All offers will be considered. Unfortunately, we are unable to accept offers for sponsorships from any contractor, including their affiliates (division, business groups, subsidiaries, etc.) subcontract arrangements, teaming partners and joint venture partners who are currently participating in, or who intend to participate in, any solicitation issued by the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), or will involve AFFTC requirements of $100,000 or more.  If your company meets these criteria, we request that you do not submit a sponsorship offer thereby eliminating the need for rejection by the government.  More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered.  Requests for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than December 3, 2004.  This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non-appropriated fund instrumentality of the United States Government.  It does not obligate appropriated funds of the government.  For more information or sponsorship opportunities, contact Melissa L. Ackman at (661) 277-3802 or E-mail address: Melissa.ackman@edwards.af.mil*****

THE U.S. COAST GUARD AIRCRAFT REPAIR AND SUPPLY CENTER (ARSC) INTENDS TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES  FOR  REPAIR  OF:  (1 ) EACH VERTICAL STABILIZER ,  PN# MY20310G01 NSN: 1560-14-477-2082 . THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) IS DASSAULT AVIATION , CAGE CODE F6117 . REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OEM SPECIFICATION, STATEMENT OF WORK, 
U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 VERTICAL STABALIZER
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 APRIL 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s vertical stabilizer  (P/N  MY20310G01).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 vertical stabilizer assembly.  The repaired vertical stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of vertical stabilizer repair.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a baseline repair and would include the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul vertical stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
a.	OEM :
1.	MY20331-15 drawings
2.	Falcon 20 Maintenance Manual , PUB: 067P, Chapters 51 and 55

Description:  Remove Steamship "NOBSKA" from Dry Dock 1, Boston National Historical Park, Charlestown Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts.  Solicitation Number N1720040511. This project includes demolition, dismantlement and removal of the derelict steel coastal steamship, SS Nobska from Dry Dock 1 in the Charlestown Navy Yard.  The demolition process will involve the removal of hazardous materials from the Nobska as well as dismantling and recycling steel components of the ship.  The demolition process will involve using torches to cut up the ship while it is in dry dock.  Disposal of all non recyclable components such as timber decks and roofing materials will be at an approved, licensed landfill. The Nobska is a 210-foot coastal steamer that was placed in Dry Dock in 1997 under a cooperative agreement to restore the ship so it could be placed back in service.  Work on the ship ceased due to lack of funding at such a stage that the ship will no longer float and has fallen into a state of neglect and disrepair.   Dry Dock 1 can not be used as long as the Nobska occupies the dry dock.  It is urgent that the dry dock be available to the USS Constitution at Boston National Historical Park.  Alternatives to demolition and dismantling the SS Nobska will also be considered.  Parties must be able to demonstrate financial and technical ability to undertake the intact removal within the same time frame as established for removal by dismantling.  In addition, should such a proposal be acceptable, the proposer will be required to enter into a preservation agreement with the Massachusetts State Historical Preservation Officer as a part of the terms of transfer of ownership from the National Park Service to the proposer.

Award(s) may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received. The contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee for each contract awarded is $5,000. The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contracts combined shall not exceed $15,000,000. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, offerors should submit proposals containing their most favorable terms. 
Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures. Contracts will be awarded to the responsible firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each. However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s). The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s). The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards. Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factors 1 – Specialized Experience, 2 – Past Performance, and 3 – Engineering and Management Approach which are of equal importance to each other. Factor 4 – Price is slightly less important than any one of the other factors. When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3, when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4. The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government. Proposals shall be submitted in format as specified in solicitation Clause L-4, Proposal submission requirements. 
A pre-proposal conference will be held in conjunction with the site visit for the proposed Task Order 0001. Offerors are encouraged to participate in the conference/site visit. The date and time of the pre-proposal conference and site visit have not yet been determined. Offerors interested in participating in the pre-proposal conference and site visit shall fax the following information on company letterhead no later than May 11, 2004 to Graciela Steinway at 619-532-0779: Company Name, Name of Individuals attending, Social Security #, Date of Birth, U.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste  (OSW), Analysis and Information Branch intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Toxics Use Reduction Institute in Lowell Massachusetts. The institute is made up of a combination of universities and major manufacturing companies representing the entire supply chain of the electronics industry. The purpose of this requirement is to test lead free solder processes (previously developed  based on literature published by members of the Toxics Use Reduction Institute), and bring them to the manufacturing floor. The main goal of this project is to develop and refine processing techniques presently used, eliminating the use of lead in the printed wiring board assembly of personal  electronic devices, such as computers. The results of these tests will support the feasibility of using lead free solder processes on various electronics in manufacturing scenarios, as well as promote the acceptance of these processes by large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Under this  purchase order, the Toxics Use Reduction Institute shall identify a qualified circuit board manufacturer who provides circuit boards to large OEMs to conduct the testing of the lead free solder. A design experiment matrix shall be developed by the contractor based on their experience and the  available resources and materials. The experimental design factors and levels shall be selected by the contractor based on (1)cost, (2) performance, (3) transferability, but at a minimum must include: PWB Finishes, Reflow Atmospheres, Solder Pastes, Component Lead Finishes, and Sn-Pb eutectic  solder PWB (to be used as the control PWB). The contractor shall also publish at least two reports, one interim report after the first set of tests are complete following the reflow process, and a final report at the conclusion of the post-thermal cycling tests. The contractor shall also present  test methods and results at various regional industry conferences and events. It has been determined that the Toxics Use Reduction Institute is the only vendor uniquely qualified to satisfy this requirement due to the fact that they are the only organization jointly supported by industry and  environmental groups and have demonstrated the feasibility of producing visually defect-free soldering of lead free electronic components. The Toxics Use Reduction Institute has laid the foundation for this project through previous research, and this requirement is the final phase before project  completion. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541710. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. However, in the case where a firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of the  announcement will be considered and given an adequate evaluation. Responses to this posting MUST be in writing ONLY. Phone calls will not be accepted. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government. All questions or inquiries should be directed to Claudia Armstrong via e-mail ONLY at armstrong.claudia@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541199   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) Climate Protection Partnership Division (CPPD) Energy Star Labeling Branch (ESLB) intends to procure commercial services, for legal services in Registering the Energy STAR Name and Logo internationally. The resultant Purchase Order will be for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The option periods will be exercised unilaterally at the Government's discretion.   The procurement of this commercial service will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedure, Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.   The purpose of this acquisition is to provide non-personal services for the 1) preparation, filing, and prosecution of separate applications for foreign registration of EPA's  ENERGY and Star Design (as a certification mark) and the word mark ENERGY STAR (as a service mark) in Mexico, India, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein; 2) preparation, filing, and prosecution of a separate application for foreign registration of the ENERGY and Star Design (as a certification mark)  in China; 3) completion of separate applications for foreign registration of EPA's ENERGY and  Star Design (as a certification mark) and the word mark ENERGY STAR (as a service mark) in Brazil, South Africa, and Egypt; and 4) maintenance of existing foreign registrations as renewal is needed in the  countries of the European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan, and China (in the case of the service mark).  The certification mark is used in EPA's ENERGY STAR? Programs to denote that a product of a manufacturer or retailer meets the energy efficiency guidelines  established by EPA. The service mark is used to promote energy efficiency and energy efficient products and services. ENERGY STAR?, a U.S. registered service mark (reg. No. 1,999,485), was first used in commerce in August 1993.  ENERGY and Star Design, a U.S. registered certification mark (Reg.  No. 2,074,946) was first used in commerce in August 1993 on or in connection with energy efficient computers, computer monitors and computer printers.  In 1999 EPA registered the ENERGY and Star Design (Reg. No. 2,244,615) for an expanded list of the goods based on EPA's use of the mark in commerce  or in connection with  office equipment, commercial and residential space conditioning equipment, residential lighting fixtures, fenestration products, household appliances, building, and consumer electronics.  Similarly, in 2004, EPA registered the ENERGY and Star Design (Reg. No. 2,817,628) to  further broaden the scope of these goods based on its bona fide intent to use this certification mark on or in connection with the following goods that meet certain specified energy efficiency standards:  consumer electronics, kitchen appliances, household appliances, household fans, lawn-care  equipment, commercial and residential space conditioning equipment, fenestration products, commercial and residential lighting products, office equipment, building, pool and hot tub pumps and motors, vending machines and power tools.   In 1999, EPA began to register the ENERGY and Star Design (as  a certification mark) and the word mark ENERGY STAR (as a service mark) internationally. A lists of the countries and dates with completed registrations will be provided via email per request to blanding.donna@epa.gov. In 2004, EPA refined the ENERGY and Star Design certification mark in two ways.   First, the words "ENERGY STAR" were added into the mark so that it is closely associated with the ENERGY STAR name.  Second, blue is now the primary color for the mark because it represents many positive attributes for ENERGY STAR including clarity, air, sky, and the environment.  ENERGY STAR Blue  (100% Cyan) is the preferred color for the use of the mark.  Because the main elements of the ENERGY and Star Design remain unchanged, it is not necessary to refile any  registrations.  However, moving forward, any new registrations, including the ones listed in this Statement of Work below will be  for the refined mark which includes the ENERGY STAR name; however, the mark will still not include color for registration purposes. 1.0	SCOPE:  The Contractor shall prepare and file documents in the form of a service mark application for the word mark ENERGY STAR and in the form of a  certification mark application, or its closest equivalent, for ENERGY and Star Design in Mexico, India, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. The Contractor shall also prepare and file documents in the form of certification mark applications (6 certification classes), or its closest equivalent, for  the ENERGY and Star Design (as  a certification mark) in China.   For each country, the certification applications, or their closest equivalent, shall certify buildings, roof products, pool and hot tub pumps and motors, commercial and residential lighting products, commercial and residential space  conditioning equipment, consumer electronics, fenestration products, household appliances, household fans, kitchen appliances, lawn-care equipment, office equipment, power tools, residential lighting fixtures, and vending machines.  When used by  authorized persons the certification mark shall  certify that the goods identified above meet EPA's specifications for energy efficiency.  These applications must, in form and substance, comply with all laws, rules and regulations for registration of these marks in the countries identified above. The Contractor shall also complete the  prosecution, including the payment of publication or registration fees, as needed, for a service mark application for the word mark ENERGY STAR and a certification mark application, or its closest equivalent, for ENERGY and Star Design in Brazil (currently both have been filed but neither have been  examined yet), South Africa (currently both published and should be receiving a registration shortly), and a certification mark application, or its closest equivalent, for  ENERGY and Star Design in Egypt (publication fees have been paid for this application which is proceeding to  registration).

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a sole sourced contract for protective masks and protective throat collars from Simunition, Ltd, P.O.Box 576, Avon, CT 06001.  The IRS intends to purchase 3158 each of the protective masks and protective throat collars.  The reason for procuring these items on a sole source basis is that the IRS uses the Simunition FX marking cartridges and these masks and throat collars are the only ones approved for use with these cartridges.  Therefore, all items purchased will be compatible with the Simunition FX marking cartridges.   The protective mask provides excellent protection to eyes, ears, chin, face and back of the head but still allows the user to communicate during the simulated exercises.  This design allows 280 degree peripheral vision through the scratch-resistant polycarbonate anti-fog coated visor.  The shell is made of high-quality super-tough nylon.  Both visor and shell are guaranteed to withstand the impact of 9mm and .38 Special / .357 magnum FX marking cartridges.  The one-size-fits-all design is lightweight, easy to adjust, remarkably comfortable and can be worn with eyeglasses.  The protective throat collar, FX 8000, is designed, tested and approved to offer outstanding throat protection when used with the FX marking cartridges.  The collar fits snugly around the neck and is easily adjustable.  The FX 8000 protective throat collar is made of high quality nylon, which is flexible, comfortable and resistant to wear and tear.  It is lightweight, waterproof and easy to wash and maintain.  FX marking cartridges leave highly identifiable colored marks on this specially selected material.  This procurement action is being conducted under the Test Program for Commercial items, FAR 13. 5.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, all interested parties who identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, shall be considered.  A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government.  All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via mail, facsimile, or e-mail within 10 calendar days of the published date of this notice.  Documents over 10 pages total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Verification of receipt of fax and e-mail transmissions is the sole responsibility of the contractor.  All Treasury contractors are required to be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receipt of an award.  If no acceptable responses are received, an award shall be made to Simunition, Ltd.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

PERFORMANCE OF THE LIGHTWEIGHT COUNTER MORTAR RADAR (LCMR) PRE-PRODUCTION MODEL: 3.0 REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Item Definition   The LCMR provides the ability to detect and locate mortar firing positions automatically by detecting and tracking the mortar shell and then backtracking to the weapon position. The LCMR provides continuous surveillance using an electronically scanned ante nna.  The LCMR has been designed to be compatible with airborne operations and can be deployed in a door bundle. The system can be assembled and disassembled quickly by two soldiers. When a mortar is detected, the LCMR sends a warning message indic ating a  round is incoming.  After sufficient data are collected to enable an accurate weapon location, the weapons location is transmitted. 3.1.1 Functionality  The system has been tested for its ability to perform automatic detection, classification, and location of incoming mortars.  The system has demonstrated performance of these fu nctions  without any operator interaction, except for system initialization in formation.  LCMR has demonstrated the ability to: a. Perform radar functions (detect, track, etc.) b. Discriminate between mortars and other tracks c. Accurately locate weapon firing positions  d. Communicate information to operator e. Operate on battery power f. Meet Emplacement / Displacement times g. Meet Maint ainability requirements (Fault detection, isolation, and repair). 3.1.2 System Configuration The radar system configuration is defined as consisting of the following:      a. Radar Antenna, Receiver Signal Processor Group      b. Battery / Power Supply Assemblies      c. Remote Control and Display unit (Pocket PC/PDA)      d. Mission Planning Computer      e. Mechanical Assembly (tripod, cover) 3.2 Characteristics 3.2.1 Target Type Primary targets for detection, location and classification are mortars.  Secondary targets for track and identification are light artillery and rockets. For the purpose of defining system performance, a target will be considered to be valid if it meets the   following criteria: Minimum muzzle velocity: 65 m/sec Maximum muzzle velocity: 320 m/sec =?646?Q?The target must achieve a minimum height above the local terrain mask of 200 mils as observed from the radar and remain in the radar surveillance coverage for a minimum of 2 seconds.  3.2.2 Location Range LCMR is capable of locating 81 mm mortars to the specified accuracy from 1 km to 5km and 120 mm mortars to the specified accuracy from 1 km to 6 km. 3.2.3 Azimuth Coverage The radar azimuth coverage is 360 degrees. The system is capable, via operates PDA, of setting the azimuth scan between and 360? 3.2.4 Probability of Location   Probability of location is defined as the probability of detecting and computing the point of origin of in-flight projectiles. For an individual weapon firing a single round in a benign non-jamming environment, the probability of location has been demonstrated to exceed 85% averaged over all weapon firing azimuths and weapon ranges within the required location range of the radar. 3.2.5 Location Accuracy   LCMR has demonstrated Target Location Errors (TLE) of better than 100 m (50% CEP) for the maximum specified location range on each target type, averaged over all weapon firing azimuths and weapon ranges within the required location range of the radar.  3.2.6 Target Track Capacity   The radar  is capable of maintaining track on 20 simultaneous in-flight projectiles originating from separate sites randomly distributed in the coverage area of the radar.  The probability of location under these conditions is greater than 85%.  When addit  ional projectiles are being tracked simultaneously, the probability of locating a new weapon firing may degrade. 3.2.7 In-bound/Out-bound Mode of Operation The radar  performs friendly (out-bound) projectile impact prediction and hostile (in-bound) weapon location and projectile impact point prediction. The radar is capable of simultaneous in-bound/out-bound operation.   3.2.8 Hostile Projectile Impact Prediction   The projectile impact point  is predicted.  (No accuracy requirement) 3.2.9 False Location Rate The radar has demonstrated a false location rate no more than one (1) per six (6) hours over a 24 hour day/night cycle. A false location is defined as an indication by the radar that an in-flight projectile has been detected and a firing point located when  , in fact, no projectile has been fired.  This performance was achieved in a benign (no local aircraft activity within 5 km) environment. Distant (less than 5km) aircraft have displayed no tendency to cause false locations. 3.2.10 Operation 3.2.10.1 Height Correction The radar system accepts Level 1 DTED data and automatically performs height correction. 3.2.10.2 Target Classification  The radar system , as evidenced from demon strated PL, is able to discriminate mortars from aircraft targets. 3.2.10.3 Zonal Control.   The LCMR operator may designate zones in which the operation of the radar is restricted.  A minimum of ten (10) zones of each type is supported.   The following types of zonal operation are available: a.Target Intelligence Zones  b. Censor Zones.  c. Call for Fire Zones.  d. Critical Friendly zones:  The zones are def ined in accordance with existing conventions. 3.3 Remote Control and Display Unit (RCDU) The radar is capable of communicating with a Personnel Digital Assistant (PDA)-class computer over a wireless radio link to a distance of 1000 m.  The RDCU supports all functions necessary to initialize and operate the radar. The RDCU also provides system status, battery status and Built-In-Test information to the operator. 3.3.1 Communication Interface The LCMR pre-production system communicates only with its wireless PDA or via Ethernet. 3.3.2 Prime Power Prime power required is approximately 300 watts.  The radar is capable of being powered by batteries for a minimum period of three (3) hours without battery replacement. (demonstrated using six (6) BA-5590 batteries)  The system is also be capable of being  powered using standard 24 volt DC vehicle power and adaptable to AC power, 85VAC 93240VAC,_40Hz 400Hz. 3.3.3 Weight Total system weight is weight is less than 120 lbs including any one of the following power sources/considerations:    - Battery container (battery weight not included in weight budget)    - vehicle DC adapter cable    -  AC power supply 3.4 Emplacement and March Order System assembly and initialization by a two person crew has been demonstrated in less than 20 minutes. The system can be disassembled and readied for transport by the same crew in 3 minutes. 3.4.1 System Leveling The_radar has an integrated levelng system that allows the system meet its performance requirement? on terrain with a slope. 3.4.2 Orientation The radar is capable of automatically determining azimuth orientation with the input of 2 surveyed points. The system is also capable of accepting AZ orientation information from an external source. 3.5 Transportability The system is packed into two (2) transport cases that allow for various Joint SOF and conventional Army methods for transport and delivery into the operational theater.  3.5.1 Air-Drop N/A 3.5.2 Door Bundle The transport cases can be safely delivered using standard door bundle techniques.  3.5.3 Vehicle Mounting N/A 3.5.4 Waterproof Container N/A 3.6 Environment 3.7 Operating Environment The radar system is able to operate in various environmental conditions found throughout the world as described: 3.7.1 Operating Temperature The system has been successfully tested to operate with external temperatures between B0F and +120=C3=82=C2=B0F 3.7.2 Storage Temperature.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services, Solicitation # GS-04P-04-EXC-0039 – Charlotte, North Carolina, Contracting Officer's Phone Number(404) 331-4630. Industry Day.

On Tuesday, August 31, 2004, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Day for Small Business Architect/Engineer firms, which may be interested, in participating in the design phase of the new United States Courthouse in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Industry Day will be conducted from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Charles R. Jonas Federal Building, 401 West Trade Street, Charlotte, North Carolina in the Ceremonial Courtroom located on the second floor.  Please arrive early to allow time to go through security.  Picture IDs will be required.  Cell phones, laptops or any other electronic equipment will not be allowed in the Federal Building.

The facility to be designed and constructed will consist of 390,724 gross square feet and will provide space for the U.S. District Court, the U. S. Magistrate Court, the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and associated chambers.  Space will be included for the U. S. Marshal Service, the U. S. Attorney, U.S. Probation Officers, U.S. Pretrial Service, Public Defenders and GSA.  There will be sixty inside parking spaces.  The courthouse will be located within the Central Business District, of Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Estimated Construction Cost Range is approximately $80 million to $90 million.

Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the short-listed A/E Design Firms that have been selected for this project.

Prospective Small Businesses will be given an opportunity to network with the short-listed A/E Design Firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified consultants/subcontractors.  Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist the short-listed A/E Design Firms in identifying qualified consultants/subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals established for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between the potential Lead Designer and Consultants/Subcontractors, any contracts that may develop as a result of Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about Industry Day may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA’s Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Dinora Gonzalez, GSA’s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail: Dinora.Gonzalez@GSA.GOV.

This Amendment/Modification covers the above referenced solicitation and is hereby amended as follows:

1.  The tentative date for release of the Request For Proposal (RFP) package on CD-Rom(specifications & drawings)is May 6, 2004.

2.  The anticipated date for receipt of proposals in response to this Request For Proposal (RFP) is June 7, 2004, at 4:00p.m, Chicago time.  

3.  All other terms and conditions remains the same.

ANY FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON FEDBIZ OPPS AT WWW.EPS.GOV.   

 l LEED Requirements"? For example, we interpret that all requirements listed in Spec Section 01524 Construction Waste Management are to be included in pricing for Option 16 and not the base bid. Is this correct? It would be helpful to be very specific about exactly what are the "Additional LEED Requirements".
Response:
This option shall include the requirements of the three referenced specification sections only.  The intention of labeling this as “additional” requirements refers to the fact that some submittals, testing or documentation is required in the base bid standard product specifications.  This work shall remain in the base bid, even though it is also mentioned as a requirement of the LEED specification. The Option price should only include the “additional” testing, or submittals required.  Section 01524 is not listed in the description of this option and therefore shall be part of the base bid. As full documentation of the waste management plan is required to be submitted for LEED and Section 01352 any “additional” documentation / copy requirements would become part of the Option.

7.	Is it a requirement that the comparable projects were under a general construction vs. other delivery system
Response: No, other delivery systems are acceptable as long as the intended level of responsibility is demonstrated and the process and specific roles are explained.

8.	The count of more than 1 but maximum 5 comparable projects—is this count for each of the offeror and each key subcontractor or a total for all combined?
Response: The requirement is for each key subcontractor

9.	Section 01810 Part 1.11 - A.: Please clarify if the CxA meetings shall be conducted weekly, biweekly or monthly. All three of these options currently appear in the specifications.
Response:  the meetings will probably average biweekly.  It is anticipated that there will be less meetings required during the early phases of the project and weekly meetings required during the commissioning phases.

CONTRACTORS SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS  BELOW. THE U.S. COAST GUARD AIRCRAFT REPAIR AND SUPPLY CENTER (ARSC) INTENDS TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES  FOR  REPAIR  OF:  (1 ) EACH VERTICAL STABILIZER ,  PN# MY20310G01 NSN: 1560-14-477-2082 . THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) IS DASSAULT AVIATION , CAGE CODE F6117 . REPAIRS ARE REQUIRED TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OEM SPECIFICATION, STATEMENT OF WORK, 
U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 VERTICAL STABALIZER
STATEMENT OF WORK
27 APRIL 04

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s vertical stabilizer  (P/N  MY20310G01).
2.0	OBJECTIVE
2.1.1.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized 
repair center to effectively repair and provide a complete, ready-to-install HU-25 vertical stabilizer assembly.  The repaired vertical stabilizer must meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair.
2.1.2.	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of vertical stabilizer repair.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage and replacement of hardware and/or skin.  Second, “extensive repair” would be required for a stabilizer that is beyond the scope of a baseline repair and would include the replacement of major extrusions, i.e., fittings.  The quoter shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline repair.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the quote.  Quoters may submit additional levels of service.
3.0	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the quoter will be required to meet the following technical criteria: 
3.1.	The quoter is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, original Manufacturer’s drawings and specifications, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance,  preservation, storage, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul vertical stabilizers.
3.2.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and dimensions.
3.3.	Past Performance.
3.3.1.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items.
3.3.2.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address
3.3.3.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

The objective of this solicitation is to provide environmental engineering services and incidental architect-engineering services to various Navy and Marine Corps facilities, and other government facilities within the contract geographic area, to meet statutory compliance requirements for all applicable environmental laws and regulations with regard to air quality. Additionally, the contract may provide air compliance support to CERCLA, RCRA, and Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) projects. The work to be ordered under this contract will be performed at various locations within Southwest Division's footprint. Work may be located in CA, AZ, NV, NW, AK, WA, OR, ID, UT AND MT as deemed necessary to meet workload requirements. The majority of the work will be performed in CA. The exact location of work will be designated in the individual contract task orders. 
The proposed Task Order 0001 requirement entails developing, submitting, and implementing a Class I Air Operating Permit for U.S. Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, in accordance with Title V of the Clean Air Act and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) Provision R9-3-527.C. Applicable requirements are codified in the following articles of the Arizona Administrative Code, Title 18, Chapter 2: Article 3 (Permits and Permit Revisions), Article 6 (Emissions from Existing and New Non-point Sources), Article 7 (Existing Stationary Source Performance Standards), Article 8 (Emissions from Mobile Sources [New and Existing], Article 9 (New Source Performance Standards), and Article 11 (Federal Hazardous Air Pollutants). Developing this Permit will require a comprehensive air emission source inventory to calculate the combined and total impacts of all current and potential emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from aircraft, support equipment, ordnance, other mobile and fixed internal combustion engines, painting and solvent operations. Ozone depleting substance-containing refrigeration equipment and impacts from fugitive dusts (PM-10) will also be evaluated and quantified. The Class I Air Operations Permit application will require an exhaustive compilation of air emission calculations and actual stack/source emissions data, and assemblage of the draft and final permit for submission to ADEQ. The Options for the proposed task order 0001 provide ongoing Permit compliance support for the installation Environmental Department as described in this Scope, including modifications of the Permit to reflect changes to the MCAS Yuma mission. The duration of work under the task order shall not exceed 540 calendar days under the Basic and an additional 365 days under the Options.

All references identified in the basic contract remain in full effect. 
The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than the offeror(s) submitting the lowest total price(s); and to award contract(s) to the offeror(s) determined to be the most advantageous to the government. Award(s) may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received. The contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee for each contract awarded is $5,000. The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contracts combined shall not exceed $15,000,000. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, offerors should submit proposals containing their most favorable terms. 
Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures. Contracts will be awarded to the responsible firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each. However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s). The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s). The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards. Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factors 1 – Specialized Experience, 2 – Past Performance, and 3 – Engineering and Management Approach which are of equal importance to each other.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program is interested in receiving abstracts and ultimately proposals (technical and cost) on the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers – solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts. Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs. Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP program.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) is posted at www.nsrp.org. The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.  Potential proposers are advised that there are several changes incorporated in this year's solicitation that bear particular attention, including cost share requirements and project metrics.

Teaming
Teaming arrangements are encouraged. At least one U.S. shipyard should be substantially involved in each project, normally in a leadership role. Exceptions to this may be considered on a case-by-case basis where there is compelling justification that the program mission is best served by the proposed deviation. 

Awards
Due to limited funding, the NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received. The amount of funding available will be dependent upon receipt of Government Fiscal Year 2005 funds.  Awards will be made using a Technology Investment Agreement. These assistance instruments are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A copy of the NSRP ASE Program Technology Investment Agreement is available on the NSRP Web site (www.nsrp.org) under R&D Programs. 

For those proposals that are approved for award by the Executive Control Board (ECB), a letter contract will be executed immediately after the selection meeting.  This letter contract is expected to be for a period of 30 days with sufficient funding to conduct project kickoff activities.  All proposers, unless exceptions are authorized by the ECB for unusual circumstances (e.g., significant changes to the SOW directed by NSRP), will be expected to sign the final agreement within 30 days of selection. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to terminate awards if the offeror is not able to conclude a formal, signed Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) within 30 calendar days of selection notification.  

RA Process: This is an unrestricted solicitation. 

Proposal Preparation and Submittal
Offerors should obtain a copy of the latest NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise Proposal Preparation Kit (currently version 4.4 - available from the NSRP ASE and NSRP Web site at www.nsrp.org).

REQUIREMENTS

Technical Description
This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices in U.S. shipyards as described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). A synopsis of the six major initiatives follows:
	
	SHIPYARD PRODUCTION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES
Shipyard Production Process Technologies addresses all production processes used to transform raw material, services, components, equipment, and interim products into completed products. Specifically, these processes include steel, aluminum and composites fabrication, sub-assembly, assembly and erection, outfit fabrication, installation and test, surface preparation and coating, joining, process control (accuracy control and process management), and services (transportation and rigging). This announcement includes potential efforts in all six related sub-initiative areas

BUSINESS PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES  
Business Process Technologies encompass all business processes from initial business strategy development to post-delivery customer service, required to rapidly and effectively respond to the marketplace.   This announcement includes potential efforts in four related sub-initiative areas: Sourcing and Supplier Integration; Planning and Production Design Processes; Pre-Contract Processes; and, Contracting Processes

	PRODUCT DESIGN AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGIES
Product Design and Material Technologies include the parametric design rules, metrics, design and material standards, design and analysis tools, and engineering data required to rapidly and efficiently design modern ships in response to market inquiries and to support the follow on contract design, detail design and production phases. This major initiative includes the identification and development of advanced product designs and materials to support development of the next generation of high performance ships. This announcement includes potential efforts in four related sub-initiative areas:  Advanced Product Designs and Materials; Portfolio of Preliminary Designs; Parametric Design Rules and Metrics; and, Material Standards.
	
	SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES
The overall application of information technologies to shipbuilding is categorized as Systems Technologies within the Strategic Investment Plan. The scope of systems technologies includes the underlying information systems infrastructure required to support the other initiatives with emphasis on the tools, environment, and integration required to reduce product realization lead time and provide for tighter coupling between enterprise functions. For the purpose of this initiative, the scope of Systems Technologies can be characterized as an “Integrated Shipbuilding Environment” (ISE). This announcement includes potential efforts in six of the eleven sub-initiative areas: CAM Interfaces; XML Definition for Interoperability; Evolution of STEP; Advanced Design, Simulation, Analysis and Estimating; and, Parts Library Catalog System (Prototype Development and Full Deployment).
	
	FACILITIES AND TOOLING
Facilities and tooling includes the functions of providing and maintaining a physical plant capable of assembling, modifying and repairing ships in an efficient, safe, controllable and ecologically acceptable manner. This Major Initiative focuses on asset management issues such as facility utilization, facility planning, maintenance, and capital investment strategies.  Additionally, included with this Major Initiative are several risk avoidance issues such as environmental, safety, health, and ergonomic practices within the shipyard.  
	This announcement includes potential efforts in all five related sub-initiative areas. 

	CROSSCUT INITIATIVES
Crosscut initiatives encompass the key factors related to people and organizations that can impact the successful implementation of technology advancements and changes in the shipbuilding and repair industry. These factors integrate into all of the major initiatives identified in the NSRP ASE program.  This announcement seeks both separate projects that focus on the crosscut factors in general, as well as proposed crosscut solutions developed as supporting elements of the other major ASE initiatives.  This announcement includes potential efforts in all four related sub-initiative areas. 

SPECIFIC INTEREST AREAS

Lean Enterprise Concepts
While not a separate major initiative, of particular interest during this solicitation are initiatives directed toward furthering the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry’s adoption of Lean enterprise practices.  Shipyards have begun to realize the benefits of applying Lean enterprise principles across the entire value stream from supplier to the final customer.  There is industry interest in follow-on efforts that will build on the implementation of basic Lean practices by introducing into shipbuilding and ship repair more advanced Lean concepts and the means of integrating Lean with Six Sigma and other process improvement and quality improvement programs.  Additionally, there is Congressional interest in seeing demonstration programs that apply Lean manufacturing technologies and processes to DOD acquisition programs in order to reduce total ownership cost, beginning with concept development and continuing through developmental testing.

Nationwide Shipyard Integration/Interoperability Concepts
The Navy continues to ask NSRP to extend, develop and implement collaborative approaches that support nationwide shipyard integration/interoperability, including but not limited to Common Parts Catalog (CPC) type approaches.  The NSRP Strategic Investment Plan and the current Research Announcement are both structured to support these types of projects.  Because of this interest, an area of project concentration included in this solicitation is continuing efforts related to Common Part Catalog (CPC) Initiatives, which have developed common processes and procedures for part definition and configuration management across shipyards. This inter-shipyard collaborative concentration supports industry’s Strategic Investment Plan (SIP).  The CPC Project supports integrated design/manufacturing initiatives and provides the required data definition to support material control systems. Standardizing part data allows an organization to search and find parts more quickly and accurately, permits re-use of part data, facilitates the ability to share inventory among collaborating organizations, and results in fewer parts to procure, inspect and warehouse.  This standardization results in increased demand for standard parts, which allows suppliers to better serve industry and organizations to benefit from volume discounts.  Further, the U.S. Navy benefits by needing fewer parts to support ships on-station and through the greater availability of parts across surface ship and submarine inventories.  During the 2003 NSRP solicitation, projects were proposed and selected to complete the development and implementation of CPC capabilities at four 1st Tier yards, develop the capability for 2nd Tier yards, and conduct assessments at two other 1st Tier yards.

Smaller type may be used in figures and tables, but must be clearly legible.  Margins on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right) should be at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). The page limitation includes all information, except the Cover Page, Table of Contents, List of Figures and Tables, Cross Reference to Evaluation Criteria, Resumes, Statement of Work, Letters of Commitment, and Teaming Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement.  Pages in excess of this limitation will not be considered. Offerors are advised that the number of pages should be commensurate with the degree of complexity of the proposed effort.  It is expected, and encouraged, that less complex, less expensive proposals will be significantly less than 40 pages in length. Cost proposals have no page limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to less than 45 pages as a goal.  

Preparation Cost: This announcement does not commit the program to pay for any response preparation cost. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered a direct charge to any resulting award or any other contract. 

BASIS FOR AWARD

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's response (both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. Details of the evaluation criteria are provided in the Proposal Preparation Kit, and are summarized below:

Technical Aspects: The technical aspect, which is ranked as the first order of priority relative to the other factors (cost share, proprietary content, and cost aspect), shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  Strategic fit and leverage; Business case; Innovation and technical merit; Technology transfer and industry implementation; and, Team strength and management plan.  The first is the most important technical factor. Proposals that do not meet the strategic fit and leverage criteria will not be recommended for award.  The other four technical factors are of equal importance to each other.  Each is defined in greater detail in the Proposal Preparation Kit. Given the relatively late start in this Research Announcement cycle and the associated challenges in being able to execute the program, proposers are encouraged to demonstrate evidence of a committed team ready to move out quickly upon award with an aggressive, credible execution schedule.  Proposals that demonstrate such commitment will benefit during the technical evaluation process when compared to otherwise equally acceptable proposals that do not show such commitment.

Other Factors
a.	Cost share: The proposal shall demonstrate a commitment to share the cost and risk of the proposed effort. The NSRP ASE program goal is 50% cost share (i.e., for every dollar of program funding provided, industry will provide at least one (1) dollar in cost share). Additional information regarding allowable types of cost share can be found in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit.
b.	Shipyard Specific Projects: Most of the program funding will be applied toward open, collaborative projects that are widely acceptable with broad applicability.  For this reason, most projects will be recommended for award on the basis of sharing results within the U.S. industry. Proposals with a higher degree of results that are openly shared and readily transferable throughout the industry will be viewed more favorably.

Cost Aspects: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program.

Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Environmental Control technology is one of the key research and development candidates within the U S Army.  The U S Army is interested in receiving white papers followed by proposals for basic and applied research, development, and demonstration of small,  lightweight, efficient environmental control technology and associated components for use in various applications ranging from 6 kBTUh to 120 kBTUh.  The technology shall operate within an ambient air temperature from 0 to +125 degrees Fahrenheit while pr oviding cooling.

<DESC>The High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/DE), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches to research requirements for the Wideband Antennas and Sources Research (WASR).  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A PRESOLICITATION/ADVANCE NOTICE ONLY.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED UNDER BAA 04-DE-05 ON OR ABOUT 30 SEPTEMBER 2004.  DO NOT SEND PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
 
The objective of the WASR is to design and develop innovative high power microwave (HPM) wideband antennas and sources, analysis of new materials, develop impulse radar technology for target detection and identification, and conduct theoretical analysis on advanced HPM concepts.  AFRL/DE proposes to develop and/or enhance these capabilities by developing innovative concepts in the areas of gas switched and solid-state switched sources, high voltage transformers, antennas, material physics, propagation, and breakdown.  In order to verify the advanced theory of concepts, the contractor shall conduct experiments with prototypes, modeling, and simulation.    

The overall goal of the contractor’s technical efforts shall be to improve and enhance present high power wideband capabilities in the areas of gas switched sources, solid-state switched sources, high voltage transformer development, antenna designs, new materials analysis, propagation and breakdown studies, effectiveness studies, and other high power wideband source technology.  The metrics for success will involve scientific advancement and breakthroughs in understanding of HPM microwave sources and antenna technologies.  The contractor shall document the results of these efforts in AFRL technical reports. 

WASR encompasses HPM wideband source and antenna design and development, material studies, target detection and identification, and advanced concept studies.  The goal of this effort is to improve and enhance present HPM wideband capabilities in the areas of gas switched sources, solid-state switched sources, high voltage transformer development, antenna designs, new materials analysis, propagation and breakdown studies, and other HPM wideband source technology.  We are seeking new approaches in the areas of experimental planning & execution, pre-and post-experiment analysis, and model validation/verification.  The successful offeror shall propose innovative ideas to advance HPM wideband technology and apply this technology to modern warfighter systems.  The successful offeror shall also demonstrate extensive knowledge on the physics of wideband technology.  The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25M over five years (FY05: $5M; FY06: $5M; FY07: $5M; FY08: $5M; FY09: $5M).  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. The Government reserves the right to make more than one award.  After the initial award, the Government may award task orders under each Technical Area without further competition.

Offerors may propose on one or more Technical Areas.  Technical Areas are described below.
1. Source Design and Development:  The thrust of this activity is to design innovative high power microwave wideband sources, including gas switched and solid-state switched sources.  The offeror shall provide innovative methods and approaches to developing high power microwave sources by applying and implementing state-of-the-art concepts and techniques.  The major performance parameters for the wideband source development shall include the following: output voltage, output impedance, pulse risetime, repetition rate, weight, volume, prime power, degradation mechanisms, etc.  The offeror shall include system engineering into the design and development of the HPM wideband sources.  Modeling and simulation tools shall be used to assist in the designing of the critical components of the HPM wideband sources.  

2. Antenna Design and Development:  The thrust of this effort is to design and develop innovative HPM wideband antennas that will be used in the high power microwave technology development program.  This effort shall included antennas that are specifically designed and optimized for radiating a distortionless replica of wideband transients.  These antennas must be capable of transmitting high voltage (up to 1 MV) and high repetition rate (up to 1 kHz) signals, and have a fractional bandwidth of greater than 25 percent.  The band width associated with transient antennas shall be distinguished from the approximately 10 to 1 bandwidth of the frequency independent antennas, such as the lo-periodic, spiral, flared- or tapered-notch antennas that are high dispersive and perform poorly as high-fidelity antennas for wideband impulsive waveforms.  This effort also includes conducting studies on the implementation of antennas into high power microwave systems, use of lenses and reflectors to straighten out the wavefront, variations of current antenna designs, and design of receiving sensors.  
  
3.  Material Studies.  The thrust of this effort is to analyze, evaluate, and experiment with new materials that can be used in high power systems.  This effort shall provide innovative methods and approaches for the understanding of the physics of insulators, gases, and other materials that are used in developing high power wideband sources.  This effort shall determine the optimal materials to be used in high voltage and high pressure areas.  This effort shall also provide innovative methods and approaches to failure mode analysis and material breakdown phenomenology issues.

4. Target Detection and Identification:  The thrust of this effort is to design and develop impulse radar technology for target detection and identification.  Applications shall include people with hidden weapons, see through walls, and non-cooperative weapon systems hidden under tress.  System technology development will include impulse transmit and receive antennas, highly stable impulse sources, high signal to noise receivers, and algorithms unique to this type of technology.    
  
5.  Advanced Concept Studies.  The thrust of this effort includes theoretical analysis on advanced concepts that will be used in improving the capabilities of high power microwave wideband systems.  This includes conducting studies on integrating high power microwave wideband systems into existing systems such as aircraft, radar, and other electronic systems, evaluating the effectiveness of high power microwave source design to disrupt target systems or for target identification, and conducting studies in areas such as propagation and breakdown.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  The Air Force Flight Test Center is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience for the development of Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) encoders and monitors. The EFTS will use digital communication techniques and encryption to increase command link security and immunity to interference.  The Government requests qualification packages from sources capable of providing the EFTS encoders and monitors. The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources in the EFTS encoders and monitors acquisition.  Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to perform the EFTS encoders and monitors requirements.  Background:  National test ranges use flight termination systems to control Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), launch vehicles, and munitions if there is an emergency. There is a need to improve these systems because they are vulnerable to unauthorized users and signal interference. The problem stems from the fact that the current systems use analog techniques that were developed in the 1950s when the Radio Frequency (RF) environment on test ranges was much less congested and security threats were less of an issue. As a result, designers did not incorporate the protection mechanisms needed to support today’s complex and ever-evolving test range requirements.  The EFTS design is based on the result of an RS-38 study and NSA recommendation. The RS-38 Final Report is located at the following URL: http://jcs.mil/RCC/manuals/EFTS/index.htm  Encoder: The purpose of the encoder is to receive 64-bit EFTS command messages and to format and output them up to as many as 5 interfaces (remote encoder #1-#4 or baseband output). Formatting in the EFTS context means adding 19 bits for frame synchronization, 60 bits for Forward Error Correction (FEC), 1 bit for user defined data to each 64-bit message and encoding the resulting packet using the Manchester encoding scheme. The encoder will output messages every 20 ms. The encoder will work in conjunction with the EFTS Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) Unit (TDU) to encrypt the EFTS messages prior to formatting. This means that the encoder will support the internal integration of the TDU such that operators can insert and remove the TDU to facilitate maintenance and INFOSEC requirements. Crypto-variable key loading, storage, and processing will be accomplished via the TDU so the encoder will not have INFOSEC requirements, but it will provide the mechanisms to interface the TDU. For instance, the encoder will provide a method to select 1 of 50 stored keys, the ability to zeroize keys and an indicator that tells whether or not a key is valid.  The encoder will support a configuration interface compatible with 3-wire RS-232C levels (mark at -3 to -15V, space at 3 to 15 V) at an asynchronous rate of 19.2 kbps, with 8 data bits, 1 start bit, no stop bits and even parity. The encoder will operate on single-phase, 115 volt AC power source at 60 Hz to 400 Hz. The encoder will be mounted in standard 19-inch equipment racks.  Monitor:  The purpose of the monitor is assist range safety personnel in analyzing EFTS messages that have been transmitted over the air. As such, the primary function of the monitor is to receive and demodulate the EFTS command link signal, carry out frame synchronization, perform FEC using the Reed-Solomon (5,13) technique, decrypt the 64-bit EFTS message and output it to test range processing and monitoring systems.  The monitor will work in conjunction the EFTS TDU to decrypt the EFTS messages prior to formatting. This means that the monitor will support the internal integration of the TDU such that operators can insert and remove the TDU to facilitate maintenance and INFOSEC requirements. Crypto-variable key loading, storage, and processing will be accomplished via the TDU so the monitor will not have INFOSEC requirements, but it will provide the mechanisms to interface the TDU.  For instance, the monitor will provide a method to select 1 of 50 stored keys, the ability to zeroize keys and an indicator that tells whether or not a key is valid.  The monitor will provide the capability to tune to RF frequencies between 370 and 450 Mhz with a dynamic range from  –110 dBm to +13 dBm.  The monitor will support a number of interfaces:  a Signal Strength Telemetry Output (SSTO), an Intermediate Frequency (IF) output, a nominal 7200 bps post detection output, a nominal 7200 bps post detection input (for post processing from recorders), a 64-bit post correction output and a 64-bit post correction input.  The monitor will support a configuration interface compatible with 3-wire RS-232C levels (mark at -3 to -15V, space at 3 to 15 V) at an asynchronous rate of 19.2 kbps, with 8 data bits, 1 start bit, no stop bits and even parity. The monitor will operate on single-phase, 115 volt AC power source at 60 Hz to 400 Hz. The monitor will be mounted in standard 19-inch equipment racks.  System Design:  The encoder and monitor will be fabricated from current, standard, commercial type, solid-state equipment and components, and will be of modular construction.  The primary function of the FTS is reliable transmission of flight termination messages to aerodynamically unstable or errant vehicles in response to requests that are originated by the range safety officer.  As such, the objective of the design of the encoder and monitor should be to deliver a unit no more technologically complex than existing proven design, while not limiting technology innovation.  The complexity of the system design should be minimized to:  a) improve reliability, maintainability and availability (RMA); b) simplify operations; c) simplify maintenance (periodic and corrective); d) reduce training needs; and e) improve recovery time from system faults.  Firms having an interest, capability and appropriate background are invited to submit particulars of qualification and experience.  Responses should include sufficient information to demonstrate the experience and capability to perform all areas of the required support, as listed above, as part of a qualification package.  The total package shall not exceed 25 pages. Drawings, diagrams or figures may be provided as an attachment to the response to clarify stated capabilities.  The statement of capability should include relevant background and experience, with contract numbers, names and numbers of contracting office and technical office POCs for each contract, whether these services were provided commercially to non-government agencies, and the size of the firm (large business, small business, etc.,). The NAICS code is 334220. Any company proprietary information shall be separately marked.  Because of the nature of this effort, the successful offeror will be required to have a COMSEC account, immediately prior to award of contract.  Contact Information:  All responses to the sources sought synopsis shall be provided no later than 10 Sep 2004.  Electronic responses will not be accepted. The qualification packages shall be sent via USPS, overnight or courier services for receipt at Edwards AFB no later than 10 Sep 2004, addressed to AFFTC/PKDD, Attn:  Joanne Eldredge, 5 South Wolfe Avenue, Bldg 2800, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185.  All questions shall be submitted to Joanne Eldredge at voice (661) 277-7707, fax (661) 275-7852, or e-mail: joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil.  This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  The synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources by their response to this EFTS encoders and monitors synopsis.

<DESC>The NAWCAD In-Flight/Crashworthiness Division is seeking information from potential industry sources regarding either developmental or Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that can provide improvements to Mobile Aircrew Restraint Systems for Crash & Fall protection.  Candidate platforms include both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that include mobile crewmembers.  Systems are desired that have application to large cabin aircraft to provide continuous restraint while preventing mobile occupants from being ejected during a crash or from falling through large openings, doors, ramps, etc.  While COTS equipment is of particular interest, all candidate technologies that may meet Mobile Aircrew Restraint requirements are sought.  Technologies will be evaluated for their ability to provide both crash and fall protection for mobile crewmembers while still allowing crewmembers to perform all required mission tasks.  Webbing retraction devices are sought that will sense and lock during both crash and fall events.  Technologies shall be inclusive of harnesses, retractor and automatic locking systems, lanyards, snap hooks, automatic water release fittings, and emergency attachment/disconnect fittings.  The technology should be easily retrofitted into existing and future Naval and joint service aircraft.  The technology should also have a quick release and have quick installation procedures.  Systems and their components should be able to carry a minimum tensile load of 5,000lbs.  The technology can be presented as a total system or as subcomponents of the total system.  As an incentive the technology is also sought that is adaptable to automatic release of the system when submerged in water to allow for rapid emergency egress.  All candidate technologies should be suitable for use in military applications and associated environments, and should be compatible with all aircrew body-borne equipment configurations.  Companies submitting information can present a total system or components of the system.

<DESC>The Government intends to proceed with continued pre-solicitation activities for the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection, and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Spiral-1 (RS-1), and intends to release an RFP in late October 2004 with a potential contract award in late February 2005.  Through market research, the government has determined that the RS-1 requirement shall be set-aside for small business.  Upon eventual solicitation release, a 30-day response time for proposal submittal is anticipated.  The goal for this future solicitation will be a competitive award without discussions.  To achieve this, the Government is actively engaging the contractor community to ensure thorough understanding of the requirements and objectives.  As a result of the pre-solicitation conference held 20-22 July 04, the RS-1 program team developed a compilation of questions and answers (Q&A).  This Q&A document is located on this Fed Biz Ops website as an attachment (RAIDRS Questions and Answers Aug 04.doc).  To continue communication with industry and further define the RS-1 draft Request for Proposal (RFP), the Air Force intends to hold another pre-solicitation conference 15-17 September 04.  The purpose of this conference is to:  (1) solicit feedback on the draft RFP (which the government intends to make available NLT 31 Aug 04), (2) provide Industry with an update on the plans for the upcoming RS-1 acquisition, and (3) distribute the Systems Requirements Review (SRR) data package to interested vendors (note:  any prospective offeror may submit written feedback to the Contracting Officer after the SRR data package is made available).  Capabilities for the RS-1 contract include design, development, integration, testing, production, deployment, support, maintenance, and operations of a worldwide SATCOM Radio-Frequency (RF) Interference detection, characterization, geo-location, and reporting system. Documents: The Government intends to make the following materials available for pick-up or mailing from 31 August 2004 through 10 September 2004.  Request(s) after 10 September 2004 may not be processed. 1.

<DESC>The Navy seeks to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, “Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.”  Naval District Washington, West Area, Dahlgren Detachment, Dahlgren, VA. is seeking interest and information specifically for the privatization of water, wastewater and electric distribution and generation utility systems.  The resulting privatization will include assumption of ownership, operation, and maintenance, and obligation to continue the service for an indefinite and ongoing period.

Should privatization result, the ownership of the entire utility plant and/or distribution system, including all operating responsibility shall transfer to a regional or municipal utility or to a private company.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility provider’s responsibility.  It is intended that privatization will reduce the Navy’s life cycle costs.
 
The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size and general description of the system.  Any numbers may only be estimates for this purpose.


Naval District Washington, West Area, Dahlgren Detachment, Dahlgren, VA.
 
WATER SYSTEM: The components of the water system currently in operation on the Main Site of the Dahlgren Naval Surface Warfare Center include three wells, a 275,000-gallon ground level storage tank with transfer pumps, and four 100,000 gallon elevated storage tanks. The tanks are 150 feet tall and the line pressure for the system is approximately 58 psi.  The system is chlorinated to provide disinfect ion treatment by the use of gas chlorination equipment located at each well. The operating permit designates that the system can process 1.17 MGD or 2,920 equivalent residential connections.  The components of the system in operation at the Pumpkin Neck Explosives Experimental Area include a single artesian well with a submersible pump and motor and a limited radial distribution system.  The well site has three 275-gallon hydro pneumatic storage tanks and a sodium hypochlorite liquid disinfect ion system.  There are no fire hydrants located at Pumpkin neck.  The Pumpkin Neck operating permit designates that the system has a design capacity of four equivalent residential connections.   The water distribution system consists of approximately 106,000 linear foot of primarily of cast-iron mains ranging up to 16 inches in diameter.  In addition there are approximately 51,000 linear feet of service lines.  Much of the system is over 50 years old.  Average monthly usage for calendar year 2000 was 12.8 MG.  The system serves both domestic and fire protection requirements.  

WASTEWATER SYSTEM: Sewage generated at NSWCDD is collected and transmitted to the sewage treatment plant by a series of gravity sewers, force mains and pumping stations.  Approximately 22 miles of gravity sewers and force mains and 34 sewage pump stations comprise the sewage collection system.  The sewage treatment plant has an average daily flow capacity of 0.72 mgd and can handle a peak flow of 1.4 mgd on a short-term basis.  Effluent from the treatment plant is discharged to Machodoc Creek and ultimately enters the Potomac River.  The NSWCDD sewage treatment plant is classified as Reliability Class 1, because its discharge affects shellfish beds.    A constructed wetland polishes secondary clarifier effluent and provides a buffer between the treated sewage and shellfish beds located downstream on the Potomac River.  During large rain events the constructed wetland becomes hydraulically overloaded.  Under these circumstances a fixed overflow pipe at the parshall flume directs excessive flows directly to the UV disinfection system. 

ELECTRIC SYSTEM: Dominion Virginia Power Company provides the main electrical utility service.  The electrical service is fed into the main substation by overhead 34.5KV distribution lines from Dahlgren Road (Route 206). The entire base is fed via duct bank and manhole systems and also direct buried cable.  All cable is 35KV or 15KV rated.  Most of the cable has been replaced in the past fifteen years.  The 34.5KV distribution is fed from the Main Gate Substation to ten substations and switching stations. Four of the substations are 13.8KV secondary and the rest are 4160 volt secondary.   Most of the substations have been replaced within the past fifteen years or have been installed new due to growth on the base.   During FY03 the peak daily commercial power demand was 17,692 KW.  The peak monthly consumption was 10,141,100 KWH.


RESEARCH MISSION.  The installation has an ongoing mission to conduct research and development in the area of utility infrastructure assurance.   As a direct result, the utility system owner/operator shall be expected to accommodate a variety of circumstances that are not normal to the ownership and operation of a utility.  The installation, in the fulfillment of its mission, retains the full and unfettered capability to engage in a series of research and development activities affecting the utility systems.  Such activities may include (but are not limited to) exercising unlimited access and control of the affected utility for test purposes, conducting effects testing against the utilities infrastructure, placement, maintenance and operation of a variety of sensors and control devices on the utility systems, and the training of installation personnel on utility system operations, control and consequence management.  Existing SCADA and DDC control systems will continue to function for monitoring and control purposes and will remain Government property.   The Government will indemnify the contractor from any harm that may occur as a result of its research activities.
 
  
This Request for Information (RFI) is required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties under the Department of the Navy’s utilities privatization program.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals (RFP).  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal RFP will be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a Statement of Interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length, printed on one side only, and double-spaced) on or before 13 September 2004.  The statement shall include as a minimum the following criteria:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to purchase, expand, and operate a utility system; (3) a statement showing its understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4) understanding of any applicable state or local utility law or franchise requirements, and capability of complying with such requirements; (5) understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and its familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state for which the utility is located and US Environmental Protection Agency, Region – III; (6) interest shall be indicated for each individual utility system, i.e. list all systems that are of interest and (7) a specific written acknowledgement of the Research Mission listed in this RFI.  The Government does not intend to issue a conveyance document on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for the information solicited. It should be noted that individual RFIs for different utility systems may be issued in the same time frame.  A separate response to each RFI is required.  There will be no site visits. 
Statements of Interest must be submitted to Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic, Attention: AQ146, 6506 Hampton Boulevard, Norfolk, Virginia 23508-1278.

<DESC>SUBJECT ELECTRIC PRIMER, MK45 MOD 1	This Sources Sought/Market Survey replaces the presolicitation Notice listed under Solicitation #W52P1J-04-R-0241 which was posted August 18, 2004. DESC: The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the MK45 MOD 1 Electric Primer Assembly NSN 1390-00-877-5245. The U.S. Navy utilizes this item in the 5/54 Naval Gun system.  This item is part of the MK67 Mod 3 Propelling Charge for 5Ã¢Â€Â gun ammunition.  The item is threaded into the base of a cartridge case and tightened to a specific torque.  The Propelling Ch arge is initiated by an electrical impulse igniting a chemical composition that ignites a series of black powder charges.  The flame from the main black powder charge is vented through holes in the primer tube that then ignites the main propellant in the c artridge case.  The metal components are zinc-plated steel, copper and brass.  The approximate dimensions of the final assembly are 21.5 inches long and 1.25 inches in diameter.  Final product contains an embossed headstamp with an identification number.  Though dimension s and specific components may differ, it is similar in construction/appearance to the MK161, M83 primers. Since this item is used in an automatic feed system reliability to perform is crucial.  Potential manufacturers should have experience in handling explosives and static sensitive explosive components.  Black powder is a hygroscopic material and moisture wi ll degrade performance.  Hang fires and misfires can significantly reduce system effectiveness and could result in damage to the gun or injury to personnel. The estimated annual quantities are 33,000 for FY05, 45,000 for FY06 and 15,000 for FYs 07 through 09.  The desired delivery schedule is to begin receiving product in December 2005 at a rate of 3,000 to 5,000 primers per month.  Please advise as to economi c order quantity and estimated price range for stated quantities. Interested contractors should identify company size, descriptive information on your companyÃ¢Â€Â™s manufacturing capabilities (equipment, capacities, facilities, critical skills), and past performance on electric primers or other similar items.  Participa tion in the effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation incurred to the Government.  The Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the item described herein.   All interested sources are requested to submit responses, but only in writing with clear and convincing documentation by close of business 30 days after date released.  This synopsis is not a Request for Proposal.  This synopsis serves as a market research  tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.

<SUBJECT>67--NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award to a sole source. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for purchase of an advanced SR-CMOS high-speed camera system able to capture greater than 2,000 pps at 512x512 full resolution, and up to 90,000 pps.  The camera shall include operating software, camera cabling, and upgradeable internal memory.  This high-speed camera system is needed to observe, quantify, and evaluate the affects of holding tank design and duration that entrained fish are held at Reclamation's Tracy Fish Collection Facility.   The Phantom v4.2 manufactured by Vision Research, Inc was superior in performance during filming demonstrations of our unique application at Reclamation's Tracy Fish Facility for cameras within the budget allotted.  Other manufacturer's cameras within this price range could not capture the image quality under normal room lighting required for our study.  The Phantom v4.2 appears to exceed competitors in sensitivity and resolution with its sensor that incorporates a 22 micron pixel that is rated at 4800 ASA/ISO.  This sensor design was recognized at the last SPIEE (International high-speed technologies conference) with their 'Presidential' award which goes to the biggest technological advancement of the year.  The system is operated with a laptop computer and software unique to this system with upgrades provided free with Vision Research.  In addition, Vision Research, Inc. has an excellent customer service and technical support office located in Seattle, WA that comes with great recommendation and has hosted my many inquires.  The Phantom v4.2 comes with a 1 year parts and labor warranty. The Phantom v4.2 Camera by Vision Research has the ideal specifications (most importantly its sensitivity) to properly evaluate swimming performance as an indicator of potential negative impacts and physiological stress.  The camera that was carefully selected after five invited high-speed camera vendor demonstrations is the Phantom v4.2 manufactured by Vision Research, Inc., 190 Parish Drive, Wayne, New Jersey 07470. This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall be able to provide proof of their capability to meet the above requirements that are necessary to meet Reclamation's needs of the solicitation.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<DESC>Internet & Computer Training Labs – Baghdad Courts:  

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0  Background

     1.1. The Iraqi Judicial System was poorly resourced be the former regime and suffered significant infrastructure damage during the war.  Efforts by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Justice Advisory Team, the US Armed Forces and others have been successful in repairing much of the damage to the Iraqi judicial infrastructure, vetting the judges and key personnel and modernizing aspects of the Iraqi Legal Codes.  A review of the systems of the courts used by the various Baghdad courts by the 1st Cavalry Division revealed that the courts did not have adequately developed systems to effectively manage their dockets and coordination with other agencies.  In a series of meetings with court personnel throughout Baghdad including the lower courts and the appellate courts, the need for immediate improvements to the capabilities of the court personnel to use computers and to communicate electronic data over the internet was established.  These upgrades have been requested by Iraqi judicial personnel located throughout the city.

     1.2. Development of computer literacy and access coupled with internet connectivity is a major step toward the long term goal of the development of a system wide court administration upgrade as it will set the conditions for the use of modern technologies to manage the dockets and business of the courts. These system upgrades are necessary to bring transparency and greater accountability to the Baghdad Courts. 

     1.3. In order to ensure that the courts are properly trained in computers and digital databases, and file sharing that will be required in the future, this statement of work will govern four broad areas:  1) the acquisition and installation of fully licensed MS Office (Arabic) and operating systems and an evaluation of the computers currently in the possession of the MOJ Advisory Team for suitability of the project.  This will require an evaluation of the hardware to include whether Arabic keyboards are required and whether the computers can be used at all for the intended purpose; 2) installation of satellite based internet connectivity with required drops for the computers installed at the courts; 3) initial training offered at the courts with the installed systems for judges and personnel for 4 days with 4 hours of on- site follow-up training offered every week for 52 weeks after installation; 4) maintenance and troubleshooting of the machines and software for 52 weeks after installation 

2.0 Objectives

     2.1. The Contractor shall provide program management, installation, training and support consistent with the contract with the goal of having functioning internet computer connectivity in each court with court personnel trained to use the MS Office systems, utilize internet based e-mail such as those available at Yahoo.com and to transfer documents over that system, and how to use common search engines to search the internet.

     2.2   The contractor will ensure that the computers are maintained in proper functioning condition and that the internet is available to the courts 24 hours per day.  Disruptions in internet service will be resolved by the contractor upon report by the Court. 

3.0 Task Summary:  

The Contractor shall be expected to perform the following tasks in support of the implementation of the Internet & Computer Training Programs for the Baghdad area courts:

Complex, and Al Thawra Criminal Ct.  See attachment for location of placement.  Attachment 1 identifies the number and location for the courts within the Rusafa Appellate .  Attachment 2 identifies the number and location for the courts in the Kharkh Appellate jurisdiction.  Further, one additional internet connected work station will be installed that meets the specifications herein at each of the court buildings.  


3.2 Provide high-speed broadband connectivity between the above-mentioned courts so that the courts can effectively communicate with each other on a constant, real-time, basis and access the World Wide Web (WWW) as needed.
	
3.2.1 Provide suitable redundant systems and electrical back-ups to eliminate downtime due to power outages.
3.2.2 Provide any required hardware (monitors, computers, satellite dishes, etc.) to support internet connectivity among and between the above-mentioned courts.
3.2.3 Provide Virtual Private Network (VPN) capability to allow for secure data transfer between courts.
3.2.4 Provide broadband download speeds of at least 2048 Kbps and uplink speeds of at least 512 Kbps at each court.

3.3 Systems Support:  Provide adequately trained staff & support personnel to ensure proper maintenance of the satellite internet and computer systems for 52 weeks.

3.3.1 Training Program.  Weekly training sessions shall be provided (in Arabic) to adequately train the court personnel on the proper use of MS Office & MS Explorer software applications.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The United States Army has a need and intends to procure a new communications headset to integrate with the new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH). The communications components, requested in this announcement, shall provide a communications headset system that allows the Soldier dual or single channel radio communications in both high and low noise environments alone with hearing protection.  Items sought must be commercial items, and if applicable, available on GSA schedule.  The communication components will b e used throughout the spectrum of U. S. Army operational continuum, from humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping, to counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency, to low intensity conflict and full-scale war.  The headset will consist of modular communications  components that can be integrated into the ACH helmet system or worn independently, as a stand-alone communications system. The communications components are desired to offer two independent capabilities: 1) a low noise environment (no hearing protection)  headset, 2) a high noise environment (with hearing protection) headset, or a single modular system that does both.  The communications components will be required to operate with a variety of radio and intercommunications systems (ICS). They must interfac e (to include connectors, and straight and coiled cabling of sufficient length for body worn equipment and intercoms) with the Joint Multi-band Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR PRC-148) and current authorized handheld and vehicle mounted systems (PRC Family, SINGARS, Army Solider Intercom System (ICOM)) as well as vehicle platform intercom systems to include VIC-1, VIC-2 and VIC-3 intercoms.   The headset shall be binaural, allowing the user to simultaneously monitor two different radios, one for each ear.  The headset design may consist of two versions in order to meet the operational requirements for different noise environments.  The low nois e situations will require the user to communicate using radios and/or face-to-face communications, while listening to and understanding sounds from their local surroundings. The high noise situation will require hearing protection from high intensity conti nuous and impulse noise in addition to providing communications capability that is similar to that of the low noise situation.  The headset must also allow the user to hear ear safe sounds; both in high and low noise environments, utilizing an electronic t alk thru circuit. It is required that this circuit provides an amplification capability (roughly 15dB) of low level sounds normally out of the human range of hearing to a safe listening level.   If power is required for operation of the high noise headset,  then it must be contained within the headset unit or must be capable of pulling the power off the radio or vehicle intercom. The high noise headset also must be capable of attenuating steady state noise to a minimum of 94dBA from 125 to 8000 Hz for an exp osure time of 1-hour.  The high noise headset must be capable of attenuating steady state noise to a maximum of 88 dBA from 125 to 8000 Hz for a maximum exposure time of 4-8 hours.  The real ear attenuation must be tested IAW ANSI/ASA S12.6-1992. The thres hold sound test field shall be a noise spectrum of 110 dBA. The waterproof requirement for all communications components (i.e. microphone, earphones, connectors, cables, electrical switches, etc.) shall be corrosion proof and waterproof.  The requirement i s waterproof to a depth of 3 feet in salt water for thirty minutes.  Request product samples, photos, technical data or literature, price breakouts for unit costs/qty, delivery schedules, or other availabl e information in reference to the described systems and components.  Samples and data should be provided at no-cost and be forwarded to US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, ATTN: George Schultheiss (D230) Kansas St, Natick, MA 01760-5019 no later than 1 Sep 04.  Information may also be forwarded electronically via email to:  george.schultheiss@natick.army.mil, please copy furnish to: debra.mclean@natick.army.mil. Product samples submitted should be free of charge unless official order is placed for purcha se.  This is primarily a Request For Information, however, results of this RFI may be used to determine commercially available sources for the purchase of products to evaluate and test under a funded program.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with addition information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government plans to issue a FFP contract to provide enhancements to Keon Web Passport software used for the DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  This will be a firm fixed price contract and will be awarded utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The US Air Force utilizes the Common Access Card (CAC) to identify end users to workstations and applications.  While this provides most of the functionality required for digital access and digital identity, it doesn't meet all of the USAF's needs; specifically, there is a need to access credentials within the chain of command when access to the CAC may not be possible.  On the CAC, there is an EDI-PI attribute contained in the Common Name of the certificate (Netscape CMS Certs), which is a serial number that is issued to a user when they initially get their certificate issued.  The Air Force would like to customize Web Passport's login page to pull this piece of information from the certificate on the CAC, map it to the user in the Microsoft Active Directory and provide access to their web passport virtual card.  This would replace the x.509 login mechanism (not presently utilized) that comes with KWP; the LDAP authentication (userID and password) or SecurID would be unaltered.  This would result in the user only requiring entering the PIN initially to access the x.509 certificate on the CAC, and accept the login page presented by KWP when presented. Once the virtual card is received by the user, all other web access is permitted.  The Government's prcurement will be used to enhance the Air Force's current version of Keon Web Passport and consist of replacing the x.509 authentication DLL in the Keon Web Passport software.  Web servers will request a browser to present a user's certficate for validation.  If it validates, the user will receive access to the virtual card store.  If the user does not have a digital certificate, the user will be prompted for a UID and password.  If a UID and password is presented and validated, the user will receive access to the virtual card store.  If no certificate or UID password is presented, user access is terminated.  One the user certificate is validated, the functionality for the custom DLL would include: (1) Parsing the certificate for the EDI-PI value in the DN, or if the smart card is not a CAC, parsing the certificate presented to the browser to obtain the UID (also in the DN) of the user; (2) Looking up the user associated with the EDI-PI/UID in MS Active Directory; (3) Download the user virtual card that will provide access to the desired web services.  The Government will no longer accept nor process hard copies of Invoices/Receiving Reports.

               Performance Work Statement
1.0.  INTRODUCTION.  This requirement defines tasks for obtaining parts and services needed for the overhaul of the Pump Module Assemblies and associated component parts that are utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of HH-60J aircraft.  Funding for this contract will be provided from annual operating guide 41.00, Funds for Aircraft Maintenance.

On an “as required basis”, the contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul systems and subsystems of the HH-60J helicopter Pump Module Assemblies, as necessary to conform with the requirements of this Performance Work Statement (PWS), at the firm fixed prices specified in Section B.  
This PWS establishes the minimum requirements necessary to overhaul the Pump Module Assemblies.  Required overhaul is to be accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Parker-Hannifin Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The contractors shall provide their own manuals as the Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide this data.
In order to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B, the contractor must have access to the parts and data furnished directly by the OEM.  Proposals shall include evidence of the foregoing access.  Piece parts shall be new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Data includes complete overhaul manuals and service bulletins of the latest revisions required to perform necessary overhaul to components listed in Schedule B.

3.0.  APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS.  The following technical and operational directives are applicable to this requirement but are not deliverable under this contract.  Except where otherwise noted, the latest revision in effect as of contract award date applies.

3.1. MANUFACTURERS DRAWING AND SPECIFICATIONS:  The contractor shall have access to the latest required maintenance, overhaul manuals, and Original Equipment Manufacturer's Drawings, Specifications and Service Bulletins to ensure that equipment is overhauled, calibrated and operating in accordance with latest manufacturer's performance/test/acceptance specification criteria.  Drawings and specifications are proprietary and are not available from the Coast Guard.  Coast Guard does not possess nor can it supply the aforementioned.  The offeror will be responsible for obtaining all data.

3.2.  SERVICE BULLETINS:  The contractor shall be required to incorporate service bulletins issued prior to the date of contract if not previously accomplished.  The service bulletins will fall under overhaul to be accomplished in accordance with Original Equipment Manufacturer's latest commercial build standard and shall be included in the proposed overhaul price.
  
New service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this contract may create new part number configurations, i.e., Class II changes, which will not change form, fit or function, will be replaced on an attrition basis unless directed by an Airworthiness Directive.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the overhaul contract.  If applicable, contractor will provide within the 30-day period a flat rate overhaul price for the new part number to cover the remaining option years.  Superseded parts, which have been removed, and replaced by new part number configurations are to be scrapped at contractor's facility in the presence of a DCMAO inspector or Coast Guard designated COTR.

4.0.  DEFINITIONS.  For the purpose of this contract, the following definitions apply:

REPLACEMENT:  The substitution of a scrapped, consumable item with a new item manufactured or approved by the OEM or an unserviceable item which cannot be overhauled in accordance with OEM specifications shall be replaced with new parts manufactured or approved by the OEM.  Other than new replacement parts will need prior Contracting Officer approval.

4.3.  UNUSUAL DAMAGE:  Items which have been severely damaged due to mishandling, mechanical failure or crash damage, or in which assemblies have been cannibalized.  Items, which are missing consumable components, that are required to be replaced during overhaul, are not considered to be unusually damaged.

4.4.  CANNIBALIZED:  Components listed in Section B for which integral parts are missing when the component is provided to the contractor for overhaul.

4.5.  MODIFICATION:  To make basic or fundamental changes on items specified in the schedule of components when required by the Contracting Officer.  The vendor shall also include the part number affixed to the modification.  The contractor must be able to perform upgrades/modifications at the same time as the OEM, if contractor is other than the OEM.

4.6.  B.E.R. Beyond Economical Overhaul:  Items requiring overhaul to the extent that the total cost to overhaul exceeds 75% of the OEM’s new replacement cost, will be considered B.E.R.

4.7.  AOG:  An  “Aircraft on the Ground” condition, indicating that an otherwise operational aircraft is temporarily grounded awaiting overhaul and return of the part or component.  This condition requires the component be handled as a high priority, and that its return be expedited.

Upon mutual agreement as to price, the delivery order will be modified by a supplemental agreement.

Should corrosion be found, disassembly shall be made only to the extent necessary to remove corrosion or replace the part(s) affected. Corroded parts shall be replaced except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair efficiency or safe operation of the part. Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with OEM's current specifications and drawings, or shall meet the Contracting Officer's approval when OEM specifications do not exist or are not clear. The contractor shall provide for effects of and removal of corrosion in the firm-fixed overhaul price.

Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

In addition, the quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the RFQ performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS prepared by the National Park Service in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No N5023040015.  is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be awarded as single award contract . SITE VISIT will Be Aug. 25, 2003 @ 10:30 am . The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 115310 the size standard is 15 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Scope of Work: Horseshoe Bend National Military ParkFirebreak  ­  Scope of Work I     PROJECT SUMMARY Horseshoe Bend National Military Park is located in northeastern Tallapoosa County, at the junction of the Tallapoosa River and State Highway 49.  The park consists of 2,040 acres, much of which is dense timber stands and thick understory, with a moderately heavy accumulation of duff and ground fuels.  The park is surrounded by commercial forest land and fields.  There are nine homes within one-half mile of the park boundary. This project is to create a fuel break around the park which will protect the park in the event of wildfire on neighboring property, as well as to provide protection to adjacent property in the event of a fire on park lands.  This break will provide a defensible space to apply prescribed fire activities as part of the park's fuel and vegetation management program. This project will create a mechanically cleared firebreak along approximately 7 linear miles of park boundary (see attached map). The firebreak will be 15 feet in width (see Project Specifications, Section II) and will be constructed by cutting or mulching, not by pushing over or pulling vegetation, in order to minimize ground disturbance. The vegetation must be cut using chainsaws, hand saws, and/or mechanical-hydraulic shearing equipment or mechanical mulching machines such as a Gyro-Trac or similar equipment.  Vegetation must be cut or crushed, not pushed over or pulled up, in order to minimize ground disturbance. This project requires herbicide treatment to all newly cut woody stumps within the 15 feet firebreak.  This will be a direct application to all stumps using blue or green bark oil to insure application to all stumps.  This application will exclude all pine stumps.  The approved herbicide for this project is Garlon4 or equal.  As with any chemical application, the contractor is required to read and follow all label instructions.  The label is the LAW.  Follow all instructions concerning safety gear requirements and first-aid.   Where the firebreak crosses intermittent drains, the vegetation will be cut only by hand.  Heavy mechanical equipment will be allowed to cross the drainages only at locations directed by the park, utilizing materials supplied by the contractor, to minimize impacts to the drainages.  SITE VISIT: Each bidder is strongly encouraged to visit the site prior to bidding.  On-site evaluations are needed for accurate appraisal of work.  II     PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS 1.	The contractor shall furnish all equipment, fuel, labor, materials, transportation, etc. necessary to create a 15 foot wide firebreak along the boundary of the park, except for those areas where a dirt road is already adjacent to the park boundary (see attached map).  The total linear distance is approximately 7 miles.   2.	Contractor will cut all brush and small trees (trees less than 10" dbh) within 15 feet of the marked/flagged NPS boundary.  (Note: the firebreak will not follow the boundary at the highways - see Map and Section III)  Additionally, the contractor will remove all trees, regardless of size, within a 10 foot wide lane within the center of the firebreak to allow the passage of a park tractor and fire equipment.  All trees and brush cut by the contractor will be cut at ground level and will be dragged into the park and scattered.  Cut trees do not become the property of the contractor and will not be removed from the park. 3.	All dead trees, both standing and fallen, will be cut and removed from the firebreak.  Large limbs reaching into the firebreak from outside the break will be cut and removed, to a height of 8 feet off the ground.  Pruning cuts should be clean and smooth, at the trunk of the tree whenever possible. 4.	If the contractor chooses to use mechanical mulching machines such as a Gyro-Trac or similar equipment that chips and/or mulches the wood, that material may be scattered within the firebreak and does not have to be removed, however this material must not be left in piles or mounds. 5.	All trees and shrubs cut, chipped, or mulched shall be removed at ground level. 6.	The contractor will not cut any trees or shrubs within 15 feet of the river banks.   7.	The use of bulldozers or other equipment to push or pull vegetation over is not allowed in this contract.  8.	Where the firebreak crosses drainages, vegetation will be cut only by hand.  When crossing drainages with tracked or wheeled equipment, the contractor will be required to supply and use steel mats, sections of plastic-road (info available from park), temporary bridging material, or other devices which will spread the weight/impact of the equipment and minimize damage to the soils, vegetation and bank profiles.  These devices must be removed at the conclusion of the contract. 9.	Access to the firebreak will be via existing paved or dirt roads.  No roads or other access points shall be constructed, no matter how temporary in nature. 10.	In the event the contractor's wheeled or tracked equipment can not safely navigate the steep slopes of the firebreak, the contractor is required to notify the park, and the park will select and mark/flag an alternate route for the equipment to take.  11.	Contractor will apply direct application of Garlon4 or equal to all stumps using blue or green bark oil to insure application to all stumps. This application will exclude all pine stumps.   12.	The park is responsible for marking/flagging the boundary and the areas of the firebreak immediately adjacent to drainages where work must be accomplished by hand.  13.	The park will make minor modifications in the path of the firebreak in order to protect sensitive natural areas and historical resources.  These modifications will be marked with flagging and will be verbally communicated to the contractor.   14.	Contractor will complete firebreak clearing along the north side of the river prior to beginning work on the south side of the river. III     Firebreak Locations and Lengths  -  (See Attached Map) 1.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, MD requires full software support for the Hewlett Packard (formally Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)) VAX and Alpha systems and its backup site.  I.  SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  A.  The Government requires the Contractor to provide the following specific levels of support:  A.1) The Contractor shall support all software components and functional features of these items.  This support shall include troubleshooting and problem solution of current software products.  Also, the Government requires that the Contractor make available any "patches" and future software updates and releases and supporting documentation as provided by the original manufacturer over the life of the contract. The Contractor shall demonstrate ability to meet this requirement by showing evidence of agreement with manufacturer or other means of accomplishing the upgrades in such a manner as to be legally and technically acceptable to the original manufacturer. The Contractor shall establish a point of contact where the Government may place trouble calls regarding software.  A qualified respondent shall initiate a reply after receipt of the Government's trouble call; A.2) Software updates shall include documentation, corrections, updates, enhancements and the right under this contract to successor products.  Successor products, i.e., new software level releases, if accepted by the Government, will be provided at no additional charge; A.3) Software shall be provided in the same code format as other software provided hereunder with the same rights in data applicable thereto; and A.4) In case of new software level releases, the Government may elect to accept the later version of the software, and if accepted, software support will be provided at no additional cost and no additional charge.  Any reprogramming or additional equipment required to accommodate such later versions will be at the Government's expense.  If the Government elects not to accept such later versions, the Contractor shall continue to correct any latent defects of software supplied under this contract. Such obligations to correct latent defects shall be limited to that necessary to permit the Government to process its normal workload.  B.  The Government also requires the Contractor to provide the following support:  B.1) Response Time - It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a level of support necessary to ensure that system problems do not cause downtime.  Accordingly, the Government established a requirement that from the time the Government notifies the Contractor that a system problem exists, the Contractor shall respond within four (4) hours.  Within this response time interval, the Contractor may initially (so as to reduce system downtime) telephonically respond directly to on-site government personnel with appropriate instructions, which may return the system to full operation; B.2) All services rendered under this contract will be performed by competent personnel, experienced and qualified on the software listed for the base year clins and the option years; B.3) Point of Contact -The Contractor shall provide the Government with the telephone number of a primary point of contact for on-call service 24 hours per day, 7 days per week; B.4)  Response Time Credit -The Contractor shall grant to the Government a credit in the amount of 1 % of the total monthly support charge for each hour of delay, beginning with the time of notification plus permitted response time, and ending with the actual completion time.  In no event will the total credit exceed the total dollar value of the monthly support charges for Clins/Subclins. II. OPERATING SOFTWARE ALTERNATE I:  Operating system software refers to those routines that interface directly with hardware, peripheral devices, the computer operations, and applications and utility programs.  III.  DISCONTINUATION OF SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  The Government may discontinue any support on any item covered under the terms of this contract by giving the Contractor 30 days written notice prior to the date of discontinuation.  If service is discontinued under this clause, the Contractor shall be entitled only to payment for services rendered prior to the effective date of discontinuation. There shall be no additional discontinuation costs due the Contractor for discontinuations effected under this clause.  IV.  REQUIRED STANDARD WORKMANSHIP:  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the quality of all services rendered hereunder shall conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade or field of endeavor.  All services shall be rendered by or supervised directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade or field, and holding any licenses required by law. V. MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR:  The Contractor shall provide all necessary maintenance services as specified herein at the prices shown for the Clins (Option Years included) and shall keep the equipment in good operating condition.  Fully trained and competent maintenance personnel in accordance with the contract and the statement of work will provide maintenance coverage.  “Fully trained” is defined as capable of performing required maintenance without trial and error, or in effect, without learning on the job at the expense of this contract.  In no case shall the Government be obligated to pay for trainee cost(s), nor does the arrival of a trainee meet response time or any other requirements of this contract.  Personnel who are “in training” will not be utilized except as observers and helpers to qualified personnel.  If during the performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer questions the adequacy of the qualifications of personnel assigned to this contract, the Contractor shall have the burden of proving the personnel meet requirements.  VI:  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY:  The information technology (IT) being acquired under this solicitation/contract shall accurately process date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing, and sequencing) form, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations, to the extent that other information technology, used in combination with the information technology being acquired, properly exchanges date/time data with it.

VII:  PERIOD OF CONTRACT:  Any contract awarded as a result of an offer submitted in response to this solicitation shall be effective from the date of contract award and shall continue for a base period and four (4) one year options, unless sooner terminated under the terms of this contract.  Exercising the Option is at the discretion of the Government and shall be in accordance with FAR Part 17.207, Exercise of Option.

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW), past performance, and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are of equal importance.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.
 
Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

Past Performance:  

Offerors shall provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references shall be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-10 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-10 Commencement, Prosecution, and Completion of Work.
As prescribed in 11.404(b), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price construction contract is contemplated. The clause may be changed to accommodate the issuance of orders under indefinite-delivery contracts for construction.

COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION, AND COMPLETION OF
WORK (APR 1984)

The Contractor shall be required to (a) commence work under this contract within 10 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the notice to proceed, (b) prosecute the work diligently, and (c) complete the entire work ready for use not later than 180 days after contract award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3),
2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606,
Washington D.C. 20593
Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications: 


I. TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:  
 
QUESTION:  Reference I. SOFTWARE SUPPORT, A.1:  

1.   The Government requires that the Contractor make available any "patches" and future software updates and releases and supporting documentation as provided by the original manufacturer over the life of the contract.

and

2.  Reference I. SOFTWARE SUPPORT, A.2:
 
Software updates shall include documentation, corrections, updates, enhancements, and the right under this contract to successor products.  Successor products, i.e., new software level releases, if accepted by the Government will be provided at no additional charge.
 
As the Government is running Version 6.2 and the current VMS version is 7.3, the purchase of an H kit will be required if the Government intends to update the software.  In addition, a different part number  (QR-SMPVU-??) will need to be added to the list for updates.  If the Government intends to stay at Version 6.2, then the Government will need to pay for prior version support (best effort).  Please advise. 
 

ANSWER:  The Government understands that if it intends to stay at Version 6.2, then the Government will have to pay for prior version support. 

QUESTION:  Reference I. SOFTWARE SUPPORT, B.1:

3.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a level of support necessary to ensure that system problems do not cause downtime.
 
Please clarify "ensure that system problems do not cause downtime".
 
ANSWER: The Government has modified the Statement of Work and has deleted the following sentence from the SOW:

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a level of support necessary to ensure that the system problems do not cause downtime.  

QUESTIONS 4 thru 12 supercedes the questions that were posted on 
July 29, 2004.

4.  Section II

QUESTION:  What software components?  Please specify the applications, versions, and their function.

ANSWER:  Cobol, FORTRAN, C, DEC FMS, Basic and VMS operating system

5.  QUESTION:  How many servers carry out these tasks?

ANSWER:	two (2) 6560 vax computers (production)
one (1)  6620 vax computer (hotsite backup)
one (1)  8200 alpha computer (production)

6.  Section II

QUESTION:  Same question, what software, and subroutines are required to be supported?  

ANSWER:  Cobol, FORTRAN, C, DEC FMS, Basic and VMS operating system

7.  QUESTION:  What is the health of these applications?  

ANSWER:  Software is in good working condition.

8.  QUESTION:  Are these applications being updated or continually upgraded with new code?

ANSWER:  Software is occasionally upgraded to keep up with the current standards.

9.  QUESTION:  Please provide the current operational status of these servers and the applications.  How many users per day use these servers or applications?  How critical are these servers?

ANSWER:  All computers except the backup one are critical for everyday work at the USUHS site.  The systems are in good working order as is the system software.  There are around 30-35 users accessing the 3 systems each day.

10.  QUESTION:  Approximately how many trouble calls will be initiated per day/week/month?

ANSWER:  There are hardly any trouble calls initiated for system software; there may be a few calls from users who are having trouble with their specific programs/procedures but these are taken care of by the system manager.

11.  QUESTION:  What are the current problems if any with the current vendor that supports this infrastructure?

ANSWER:  None

12.  QUESTION:  Please define more clearly the expectations for proper operation of these servers at the operating system level to the application level.  For example, if these servers carry out FORTRAN jobs specified to run at certain times of the day and they fail, at what level will we be required to resolve this issue?  Obviously our firm did not write the code, but we are capable of troubleshooting fundamental VAX/VMS operating system and network issues.  It is very necessary for us to set an expectation of what is required of us in the event of a trouble call.  Please provide as much information on the VAX/VMS environment to help us ascertain if we are capable of providing a good level of support.

ANSWER:  The systems have been operating free of problems for a very long period of time now – over a year in fact.  The system manager takes care of anything that comes up usually.  There are cases when a problem will require more advanced support and that is why a software contract is being initiated. 

II.   TECHNICAL CAPABILIYY

1.  The Government has modified the technical capability.  Technical capability will be based on Qualifications and Management Plan.  The Preventive Maintenance (PM) Plan has been deleted.

<DESC>Technical Questions:

As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications:

1)  QUESTION:  Section I.A.1:  What software components?  Please specify the applications, versions, and their function.       

ANSWER:  The software components, applications, versions are Open VMS version 6.2.




2)  QUESTION:  How many servers carry out these tasks?   

ANSWER:  There are three (3) servers carrying out the tasks.




3)  QUESTION:  Section II.  Same question, what software, and subroutines are required to be supported?

ANSWER:  The SAS DataTrieve is required to be supported.




4)  QUESTION:  What is the health of these applications?

ANSWER:  The applications are in good condition.



5)  QUESTION:  Are these applications being updated or continually upgraded with new code?

ANSWER:  No, these applications aren't being updated or being continually upgraded with new code.



6)  QUESTION:  Please provide the current operational status of these servers and the applications.  How many users per day use these servers or applications?  How critical are these servers?   

ANSWER:  Fifty (50) users per day use these servers or applications.  The Uniformed Services University depends on the servers to process their workload. Software currently runs on the servers, which provides general accounting and funds control in addition to purchasing, fixed assets, inventory management, and cost distribution.  



7)  QUESTION:  Approximately how many trouble calls will be initiated per day/week/month?   

A specific count cannot be given.  As a requirement the contractor shall establish a point of contact where the Government may place trouble calls regarding software.  A 
qualified respondent shall initiate a reply after receipt of the Government’s trouble call.


8)  ANSWER:  What are the current problems if any with the current vendor that supports this infrastructure?          

QUESTION:  No problems exist with the current support.


9)  QUESTION:  Please define more clearly the expectations for proper operation of these servers at the operating system level to the application level.  For example, if these
servers carry out fortran jobs specified to run at certain times of the day and they fail, at what level will we be required to resolve this issue?  Obviously our firm did not write the code, but we are capable of troubleshooting fundamental VAX/VMS operating system and network issues.  It is very necessary for us to set an expectation of what is required of us in the event of a trouble call.  Please provide as much information on the VAX/VMS environment to help us ascertain if we are capable of providing a good level of support.

ANSWER:  Redundant support in the absence of critical personnel.  Systems are in a cluster configuration - 2 local systems and 1 remote system.  There isn’t a need for remote access; the contractor cans telnet into the system using the FIELD account (with a password supplied by the Government) to analyze the problem using the sysdump file.

QUESTION #6:  Is there a particular reason why this was changed to “Unrestricted” status?  Is there a current vendor doing business with the account that is not classified “Small Business”?  ANSWER:  After further research it was determined that the manufacturer of the product is not a small business, thus the acquisition was not eligible for small business set-aside status.
