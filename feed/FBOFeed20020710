<DESC>The Center for Mental Health Services (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Education Association Health Information Network, Washington, DC.
Purpose: 
The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) provides national leadership and direction for policies, programs and activities designed to improve mental health treatment and prevention services for people with mental illnesses and their families, and people at risk of mental illness, State and local levels to improve and enhance mental health treatment, illness prevention, and support services playing them within the reach of all Americans in need.  CMHS works to develop, implement and evaluate state-of -the-art approaches to meet the most challenging mental health services issues for children, adolescents, and adults.  CMHS programs also work to end stigma as a barrier to early intervention and to strengthen individual, family, and community factors that promote an individual=s resilience.  
In October 1998, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), CMHS received a Congressional allocation of $40,000,000 ($90 million in fiscal 2002), Ato improve mental health services for children with emotional and behavioral disorders who are at risk of violent behaviors.@ The allocation provides an excellent opportunity to develop the integrated continuum of prevention, early intervention, and treatment called for by the Congress, clinicians, researchers, and advocates of effective and appropriate mental health services.
The intent of the CMHS School Violence Prevention Initiative is to fund programs, which coordinate families, schools, and communities into a partnership to promote the development of healthy behaviors, competence and resilience.  These programs must be proactive by intervening early and altering the course of the lives of those targeted in a positive direction.
Teachers are the life force of any school.  Teachers provide more than the reading writing and arithmetic, they educate children about social interactions, provide for the psychological growth, and healthy development of children and youth.  Providing for the psychosocial development of children in an age appropriate manner is key to preventing youth violence.  In this time of war, attacks on the Homeland, and the resulting high level of stress it is imperative that children and youth receive education and support for dealing with crisis, trauma, and loss.  Teachers are in a unique position to provide for these needs of the nations children and youth preventing increased violence now and into the future.
During and after the attacks of September 11, 2001, teachers provided physical and emotional support for their students.  School districts quickly drained their resources of staff, and curriculum in a noteworthy attempt to provide for the psycho-social needs of students and their families.  However, there is clearly a need for new materials to assist teachers and other school staff and leaders in providing for the heighten needs of students in the areas of crisis, trauma and loss.
Objective of Awad:Consistent with the mission of CMHS and the intent of the School Violence Prevention Initiative, CMHS proposes to develop and disseminate psycho-educational materials for teachers to use in school settings. The materials will enhance the school/classroom climate and capacity for response, resilience, and readiness with respect to mental health promotion related to crises, trauma and loss.  Experts in the fields of mental health and education will develop all materials.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND	NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #20015.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07 dated 05/15/02. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection.  Bacterial and host responses are measured by micro array analysis.  From the host side of analysis, interactions and responses are measured through the use of Affymetrix eukaryotic genome chips (murine U74 set and human U133 set).  LHBP performs laboratory research on the following bacterial pathogens; Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip (registered trade mark) probe array with the above-mentioned bacterial pathogens tiled onto a gene chip.  These gene chips will be used to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. On these chips will be the conserved and unique Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and intergenic regions for 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, the conserved and unique ORFs and Intergenic regions for 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, the conserved and unique ORFs and Intergenic regions for Yersinia pestis, and all of the ORFs and intergenic regions for the following three bacterial genomes; Borrelia burgdorferi Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  This custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The LHBP intends to purchase an additional estimated 8 lots of custom multi-genome probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot, from Affymetrix.  The multi-genome custom GeneChip (registered trade mark) probe array, containing the above mentioned bacteria was designed for the LHBP at a high density of at least 10 to the sixth power per cm to the 2nd power. (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The multi-genome custom GeneChip  (registered trade mark) probe array was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip  (registered trade mark) probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The multi-genome custom GeneChip  (registered trade mark) probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip  (registered trade mark) probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and must able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip  (registered trade mark) probe array will be housed in a fixed volume reaction LIMS software database.No other system, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be 60 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA)/Bureau of Health Professionals (BHPr), intent to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with IatroSoft Corporation, Houston, Texas.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.  The purpose of this negotiation is to acquire their Workforce Linkage Project, which will allow a network of healthcare professionals to share collected mobile patient encountered data through an established distribution system.  It will permit PDA (personal digital assistance)/local desktop synchronization and Internet connectivity through an Internet resident server that will serve as the central collection/distribution point for all of the clinician related data.  It will also serve as an intranet database server.           
Because the program is based on an unsolicited proposal, which the Government has determined to be unique, independently originated and developed, IatroSoft Corporation is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C. 253 (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (A) (2) (I).  It was prepared without the Government's supervision, benefits the Agency?s mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement.  The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the Workforce Linkage Project and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  The NAICS code is 611710 and the small business size standard is $6,000,000.00.  The FBI requires a company to provide validation of Verbatim Translation Exams in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Russian. The resultant contract will be for one base year and one (1) additional option year.  The Contract Line Items (CLINs) are as follows: Base Year -CLIN 0001 - Validation of Verbatim Translation Exams in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Russian.   Option Year 1 - CLIN 1001 - Validation of Verbatim Translation Exams in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Russian. THE STATEMENT OF WORK is as follows: Background - The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) requires the trialling and validation of tests that evaluate the document translation skills of applicants for language specialist positions in each of the following languages:  Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Russian.  The contractor will provide the scoring criteria and evidence of validity for each test.  FBI personnel have constructed two forms of a Verbatim Translation Exam (VTE) for each language.  Each form comprises four paragraphs.  For each paragraph,  literal and acceptable English translations have been prepared.  The four paragraphs in each form were chosen based on the difficulty level for translation.  Text difficulty raters referred to the Skill Level Descriptions for Translation used by the FBI.  For each form, one text from Level 2, one from Level 2+, one from Level 3, and one from Level 4 were selected.  Purpose - It is important to note that the VTE is not a test of vocabulary; translation ability is not defined in terms of vocabulary knowledge since examinees are allowed to refer to dictionaries.  Rather, the goal of the VTE is to test whether the examinee can both recognize and decode complex structures and idioms into equivalent expressions in English.

Each assembled gate is approximately 15 feet wide, 24 feet tall and has a thickness of 2 feet. An assembled gate weighs approximately 62,000 pounds. In general, the work consist of disassembly and reassembly of the gates, in spection of all existing welds to structural members (three of four gates only) by a certified welding inspector, repair of deficient welds as necessary, abrasive blasting and application of vinyl paint. The lower 2 ft-9 in. of each gate is a steel casting  weighing about 6,200 pounds. Numerous cracks were found in the cast section of one of the service gates. The condition of the remaining cast steel sections on the other three gates is unknown at this time. The work may require (optional item in bid list) removal of the castings and replacement with structures fabricated from plates, which are welded together.

For each installation of a new welded lower section, boring of two new 8.500 in. diameter holes for axles and precision machining of a new seal bar on the lower surface will be required. If new lower sections are not installed, weld repair to the existing cast steel sections wo uld be performed if cracks were found. Other work includes installation of sacrificial anodes, repair of babbitt in the four sill plates, replacement of o-ring on upper head for one hydraulic cylinder and miscellaneous repairs to the gates of a mechanical nature. Installation of two government supplied air valves, located within the control tower is required.

Procurement is 100% Small Business Set-aside. Up to 150% Option Clause included. NOTE: This is an electronically formatted solicitation, available only on the Navy Web page at http://vbr.navsup.navy.mil/virtual. Paper copies of the solicitation are not available from the Navy. Certain computer programs may be required to view the solicitation and/or submit electronic offers. Do not send requests for the solicitation to the buyer. The solicitation will be available only on the web page on or about 7/25/02. You may view and/or download the solicitation only from that web page. Additional information and/or instructions are available on the web page. All responsible sources may submit an offer that, if  received in a timely manner, will be considered. See notes 9 & 26**** NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS: This Solicitation contains SUP 5252.213-9401  - Notice to Prospective Suppliers (APR 1999) and SUP 5252.213-9402 - Additional  Evaluation  Factor for Consideration of Past Performance – Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999) SUP 5252.213-9401: (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy’s Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be consi dered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled, “Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance – Navy Red/Yellow/Green Programs (APR 1999)”, will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  SUP 5252.213-9402:   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE – NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a)	This procurement is subject to the Navy’s Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b)	The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the G overnment.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established). (c)	To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSCs involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers  who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available. (d)	RYG classifications are summarized as follows: (1)	Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2)	Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3)	Red is high risk.   Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (4)	Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC  RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  03801-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  T o obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Inc.,  445 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854-1331, to cosponsor the IEEE 2002 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging.   Background and Purpose: The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society and the IEEE Signal Processing Society has joined forces with the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering to bring together, through the symposium, researchers and practitioners with different backgrounds?but with common interest in biological and medical imaging ? to share their knowledge and address the latest challenges in data acquisition, image reconstruction, image processing, analysis, and visualization.   The symposium will foster  interaction, cross-fertilization and contribute to a fully integrated approach to biomedical imaging through all scales of observation.    The National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) is the newest of the research institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIBIB is authorized by law H.R. 1795 (P.L. 106-580) which was signed by President William Clinton on December 29, 2000.  The mission of the NIBIB is to "improve health by promoting fundamental discoveries, design and development, and translation and assessment of technological  capabilities.  The Institute coordinates with biomedical imaging and bioengineering programs of other agencies and NIH institutes to support imaging and engineering  research with potential medical applications and facilitates the transfer of such technologies to medical applications."   The NIBIB sponsorship of the 2002 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging is in direct correlation with its mission.      The symposium will be held in July 2002 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, in Washington, D.C.   There are no other sources available for this symposium, and a competitive acquisition would not lead to an award to any other source.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with MSTC, Inc., A United Strategies Company, 5585 Old Farm Lane, Manassas, Virginia   20109, to purchase scanning, indexing, and tracking support services for grant applications.  The NIBIB is seeking support in its goal of development of eGrants, an electronic imaging system, as an official grant 'file' and using bar-codes in the tracking of grant files.   NIBIB seeks to establish, similar to the National Cancer Institute, Grants Administration Branch,   the electronic capturing of documents in the official grant files and to convert them to a PDF text  retrievable and searchable format.  The eGrants  software  will provide NIBIB staff a wealth of information for its use in administrative, planning, reporting and financial processes.  This electronic information will allow NIBIB easy access to their scientific contents for a variety of purposes.   The benefits of scanning include, but are not limited to, accomplishing goals set forth in the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (P.L. 105-277), enabling rapid information transmission / retrieval and facilitating a reduction in current storage space requirements, producing a significant cost savings to the institute.  Bar coding will provide easy tracking of files and facilitate an annual inventory of NIBIB grant files. MSTC, Inc. is the sole developer of eGrants software which was designed and developed under contract with the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.   No other company has contributed to or has intimate knowledge of the eGrant software structure and operations.    There are no other sources available to purchase the scanning, indexing, and tracking support services for grant applications using the eGrant software, and a competitive acquisition would not lead to an award to any other source.   This acquisition is being conducted using simplified commercial item acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541512.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.   Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PS-2002-097, may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902,  Attention: Melissa Lombardo.    All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals for the Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens.  The objective of this contract is to procure assistance in preparing the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) and the Background Documents used in the review of nominations for listing and delisting in the RoC.  The RoC is a congressionally mandated document that lists agents, substances, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are known or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.  The responsibility for preparing the RoC has been delegated to the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  Substances, agents, mixtures or exposure circumstances that are being considered by the NTP for possible listing or delisting in the RoC  are evaluated by a review process consisting of sequential reviews by distinct scientific review committees.  The Background Documents are documents which summarize all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for each nomination and are used in the reviews for possible listing or delisting of substances in the RoC.  The statement of work consists of two Tasks: the preparation of Background Documents for review of nominations to the RoC and the preparation of the RoC itself, both of which shall be measured end products.  The preparation of the Background Document project has two types of end products associated with it, the establishment of "expert panels" (estimated not to exceed 10 per year) and the preparation of the completed Background Documents (estimated not to exceed 10 per year).  An expert panel, consisting of scientist(s) with expertise and/or knowledge pertaining to the carcinogenicity for a specific nomination will be identified to help in the preparation of each background document.  The background documents are reports used in the review process that summarize all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for each nomination. The preparation of the RoC project requires the production of one type of end product (estimated not to exceed three for the entire contract), the pre-publication draft of the RoC.  The RoC is a composite of Summary Profiles, each of which contain a breif description of the carcinogenicity, exposure and regulatory information for a specific agent, for all listed human carcinogens. NAICS 541710. Period of performance will be for six years. The estimated level of effort for each year is 1,880 professional (PhD. Level) person-hours, 3,760 professional (M.A. level or below) person-hours, and 4,700 administrative person-hours.   The expected release date of the RFP is  March 27, 2002 with proposals due on May 10, 2002. A copy of the solicitation will be available on the internet at: http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm. Those individuals who wish to access the on-line version should follow the instructions provided in the on-line solicitation package. After examination of these documents, any firm interested in responding to this RFP must request the entire RFP in writing via email at

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), General and Industrial Directorate, is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor for the roll out of the Facilities Maintenance Services Initiative. The goal is to have a multi-service multiple award contract vehicle that would allow base facility managers to order services on an as-needed basis.
The initiative will encompass all services associated with facilities maintenance.   The areas that will be targeted include: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, fire alarms, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition and facility operations. This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all services that will be in the initiative.  The initial implementation was awarded in September of 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States.  This roll out will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies in the Southeast Region of the United States to include the states of Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.

Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10 thousand to a maximum potential of $100 million annually.  The maximum dollar value is contingent on the number of facilities and the extent of the participation of those facilities at any given time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235990, facilities maintenance services. The size standard is  $20 million. 

Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contracts being firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity.   One of the resultant contracts will be reserved for a small business provided that at least two responsible small business concerns will submit competitive proposals under this solicitation.  The performance period will be for five years, including a two-year base period with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Oral presentations will be a part of the technical evaluation. All information submitted is at the offeror's expense. The Government is not responsible for any aspect of transportation to or from the location for the oral presentation.  Solicitation number SP0500-02-R-0038 will be issued around 31 JULY 2002 with an estimated closing date of      17 SEPTEMBER 2002.  The exact date will be stipulated in the RFP. After the initial contracts are awarded, all services will be procured through the issuance of individual task orders, each one defined by a separate statement of work. All industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services are requested to obtain a copy of this solicitation that can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home.

<DESC>The National Weather Service/Office of Hydrologic Development located at Silver Spring, MD has the following requirement.  The period of performance is for a total of 3 years, 1 Base Year with 2 1-year Options.

Objectives: 

There are two primary objectives:  (1) Develop innovative, operational, real-time rainfall analysis techniques using WSR-88D data that will generate ensembles of rainfall products that provide most-likely rainfall estimates and associated uncertainty information. The techniques should use WSR-88D data as their primary input and should not be dependent on the availability or density of rain gauge or satellite rainfall data. These techniques could be extensions of existing NWS radar-only techniques such as the PPS or could be new ones based on dual-polarized radar data. The techniques must be robust enough so that single-polarized reflectivity data and/or dual-polarized radar data could be used as input since both forms of radar data will be available from the WSR-88D in the near future. In either case, the proposed techniques must be efficient and robust enough to be viable in the
real-time operational environment of the NWS and must be able to be implemented within NWS WSR-88D computer systems and infrastructure. The procedures and products are expected to be validated against rain gauge data or other comparable rainfall sources in a variety of rainfall regimes across the topographically diverse U.S. in all four seasons.  (2) Develop innovative techniques based on human factors considerations to display this quantitative information to users that are both intuitive and informative, yet not overwhelming.

Deliverables: 

First-year deliverables include a written report from the contractor proposing and evaluating one or more possible techniques for generating ensemble or probabilistic radar rainfall estimates. This report should include a review of existing NWS QPE techniques such as stated above to assure the contractor understands the scope of current capabilities. Semiannual progress reports are required.

If the proposed techniques are judged by the NWS to be operationally viable and scientifically valid after NWS review of the year-1 report, development of the techniques can proceed in the second year with availability of funding. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The final deliverable at the end of the third year with availability of funding will be an operational prototype algorithm, including software and documentation, that can be implemented within existing NWS systems. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Past Performance, Knowledge of real-time rainfall analysis techniques, Knowledge of display techniques, and cost.  All factors will be weighted equally.

If you are an interested responsible party that can produce the above solution, request you send an e-mail requesting a copy of the solicitation to the below Point of Contact.  The solicitation will be released about 5 days after the closing date of this announcement.  There is a DRAFT copy of the Statement Of Work (SOW) posted on the FedBizOpps.  Request you review the SOW and submit your questions to the below Point of Contact by the closing date of this synopsis.  All responses to the questions will be issued with the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- NOTICE OF INTENT:  Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs)
<DESC>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
 (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/)

REQUEST FOR COMMENTS - Comments concerning the proposed requirements should be sent electronically to Barbara Shadrick at bs92y@nih.gov to be received by July 29, 2002.   This is a notice of intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Proposals are not being solicited at this time.  Authorizing legislation and appropriations for this effort are pending.  At this time we are only soliciting comments concerning the design, construction, certification, and operations of the facilities.  

INTERESTED PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  NIAID will host a public briefing on the proposed Request for Proposals (RFP) to establish Regional Biocontainment Laboratories, on August 8, 2002, at the Gaithersburg Marriott Washingtonian Center, 9751 Washingtonian Boulevard, Gaithersburg, Maryland  20878 (telephone:  1-301-590-0044).  The briefing for the RCEs will begin at 9:00 a.m. and the RBLs will begin at 1:00 p.m.  Registration will be provided at the meeting.
 
The NIAID also intends to issue a Request for Applications (RFA) for the establishment of a network of Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCEs) -- RFA-AI-02-031.  Offerors for the RBLs will be required to be associated with an institution or consortium also applying for the RCEs.  It is estimated that this RFA will be available on or about August 8, 2002.

RFP FOR THE REGIONAL BIOCONTAINMENT LABORATORIES (RBLs)

1) Types of Regional Biocontainment Laboratories.  Only two types of RBLs will be considered for support with construction funds:

a) Comprehensive Regional Biocontainment Laboratory.  Facility or group of cooperating regional facilities that has the full range of biocontainment capabilities needed, if called upon, to:

i) safely and securely transport, receive, work with, and store or house all CDC Category A, B, and C agents and other emerging infectious agents and animals and humans exposed to and/or infected with any of such agent; and,

ii) perform research directed at the prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by all CDC Category A, B, and C agents and other emerging infectious diseases

b) Specialized Regional Biocontainment Laboratory.  Facility or group of cooperating regional facilities that has biocontainment capabilities with limited or no BSL4 containment space needed to:

i) safely and securely transport, receive, work with, and store or house most CDC Category A, B, and C agents and other emerging infectious agents and animals and humans exposed to and/or infected with any of such agent; and,

ii) perform research directed at the prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by most CDC Category A, B, and C agents and other emerging infectious diseases

2) Eligibility

a) The RBL contractors must be associated with an institution or consortium that is applying for one or more NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE) awards.  Please note: RBL contractors, regardless of independently-planned linkages to RCEs may be required to link to one or more additional RCEs post-award as determined by NIAID staff to meet program goals.

b) The RBL contractors must be U.S. public or non-profit organizations.  The RBL contractors must seek opportunities for collaboration with the public and private sectors when such collaborations promise advances in prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illnesses caused by CDC Category A, B, and C agents.  

c) The RBL contractors must demonstrate the capacity and capability to meet regional (multi-state, multi-institutional) research needs.  Consortia are encouraged. 

CONSIDERATIONS IN AWARDEE SELECTION 

1) Laboratory Type.  Establishing Comprehensive RBLs quickly is more important than establishing Specialized RBLs.  Offerors for Comprehensive RBLs will have a competitive advantage.

2) Net Cost to NIAID.  In meeting the requirements for support as an RBL, offerors may propose Comprehensive or Specialized RBLs that combine existing facilities, planned facilities to be funded from other sources, and facilities to be designed, constructed, and certified with funds from contracts awarded under this solicitation.  Net cost to the NIAID will be a consideration in selecting awardees.

3) Early Availability of Biocontainment Laboratories.  Offerors whose plans include currently available facilities, facilities ready for or under construction, and proposals for expedited completion of planned facilities will have a competitive advantage.  

 
REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

Contractors must be in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations and DHHS and NIH policies in effect at the time of contract award and with any changes in law, regulation or policy that are implemented during the period of performance.

NIAID expects fast track schedules in which planning, design, and construction cycles overlap followed by final commissioning of the facility.  Offerors who are awarded RBL Construction contracts will be selected based on state of the art designs, technical design and feasibility of the plans, scientific and technical merit, Project Plans, linkages to institutions that will use the RBL, ability to meet National, regional, state, local, institutional needs, and geographic area served.  Plans should also describe:
 
1)	High Containment Laboratory Facilities. BSL4 (for Comprehensive RBLs), BSL3, BSL3-AG laboratories for research including tissue culture and antigen production and in other in vitro studies. Insectary space for work with vector borne diseases. Cell biology and molecular biology labs are required.

2)	High Containment Animal Facilities. BSL4 (for Comprehensive RBLs), BSL3-AG, BSL3 space for conducting research on disease pathogenesis and host response in multiple species of animals. Procedures rooms and pathology laboratory space. Housing for many types of animals ranging from rodents to primates. Aerosol challenge and response assessment facilities for drug and vaccine studies in animals. Individual animal studies could involve 20 or more animals.

3)	High Containment Clinical Facilities. Isolation units for research on and treatment of patients, and human trials of virus-based vaccines.

4)	Support Staff and Systems for All High Containment Facilities. Safety and security systems that are redundant. All necessary environmental controls. Space for core medical, scientific, technical, safety, and maintenance personnel for performance of core services. Biosafety requirements found in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories at http://bmbl.od.nih.gov must be met. 

It is anticipated that offerors will be required to submit the following items with their construction proposals (not intended as an all inclusive list):

1)	Small-scale layout drawing showing possible arrangement of space, conceptual designs, and schematic designs.

2)	One set of existing record drawings, for existing space, if applicable.

3)	Topographic data (including seismic data or other pertinent information) as available.

4)	Existing utilities information, as available.

5)	Project Milestones/Schedule

6)	Project Plan including: Description of Project, Project Implementation Strategy, Quality Assurance and Quality Surveillance Plans, Environmental Control Plan, Occupancy Plan, Community Relations Plan, and Commissioning Plan

8)	Construction cost estimate.  

9)	Plans for rapidly accommodating research needs and objectives in case of a national emergency.

10)	Any other information that would assist the Project Officer and the peer review committee in determining the extent to which the offeror meets the requirement.

Awards will be based on an initial proposal identifying scientific qualifications, organizational commitment, current or planned biocontainment facilities, initial facility design that is state of the art and operationally safe and effective, design/construction team members, milestone schedule, Preliminary Project Plan, regional relationships, and cost.

REGIONAL BIOCONTAINMENT LABORATORY OPERATIONS

It is also the intent of NIAID to issue an RFP for the long-term operations of the RBL facility.  The contractor will operate, maintain, and upgrade the RBL to meet institutional, regional, and national needs.  The Contractor will provide all equipment, furnishings and supporting paraphernalia for the facilities.  At a minimum, the operations contractor shall provide the staff needed for the following core services:

1)	Management and administration of the facility, staff and contractors

2)	Safety and security - safely and securely transport, receive, work with, and store or house CDC Category A, B, and C agents and other emerging infectious agents and animals and humans exposed to and/or infected with any of such agent.  Safety and security staff will also be responsible for safety and security training for all persons who enter the biocontainment facilities

3)	Veterinary and animal care staff

4)	Maintenance services to ensure the operability and physical integrity of the facilities

5)	Scientific and technical staff to run the core laboratories and train students and new and visiting personnel in appropriate laboratory techniques in biocontainment facilities.

If feasible, RBL Operations contracts will be awarded simultaneously with RBL Construction contracts in an effort to involve the scientists and other staff who will use and maintain the facility.  Staff for core operations (safety, maintenance, animal care, etc.) will be supported via the RBL Operations contract, as will upgrades of facilities and equipment as technology changes.  

RFP FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION CONTRACTOR

The NIAID also seeks to award a contract to provide the Institute with advice on project management, program management and other services consistent with the Institute's responsibilities in the oversight of the construction of the Biocontainment Research Laboratories.  The Contractor will also assist the Government by providing advise or services required to ensure design excellence, operational flexibility, cost efficiency, and safety, and in coordinating construction efforts ensuring that any conflicts that may arise are quickly and efficiently resolved.  

NUMBER OF AWARDS AND ESTIMATED BUDGET

In Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004, NIAID anticipates awarding: 

1) RBL Construction Awards (5 to 7 awards). 

2) RBL Operations Awards (5 to 7 awards).  Awards could be for 10 years, renewable based on performance.

3) Development and Integration Contractor (1 award).  

Funds available for these projects are estimated at $150 Million for FY03 and $300 Million for FY04.  Authorizing legislation and appropriations for these efforts are pending.

<SUBJECT>A -- Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)  to Further Develop DNA Melting Analysis for Detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
<DESC>The Laboratory of Neurogenetics (LNG), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) at the National Institutes of Health seeks a CRADA Collaborator.  The principal goal of this CRADA is to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying gene variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  Because SNPs are present in large numbers in human populations (estimated at several million over the entire genome), they are likely to be retained because they are either genetically neutral or they confer survival advantages. However, when combined with other polymorphisms or environmental factors, SNPs may become low-level disease risk factors or disease modifiers.  An understanding of functional variations among groups of people is important to medicine for many reasons, including the design of more effective therapeutic drugs and a better understanding of drug side effects, a concept known as pharmacogenetics.  DNA melting analysis developed by LNG uses melting of DNA duplexes in solution to detect sequence variants.

Potential Areas of Application:
 rapid discovery of gene sequence variants 
 individualized drug therapeutics

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention: 
 non-gel-based fluorescence, high throughput method 
 ability to detect previously undiscovered sequence variants 
 knowledge of the SNP (or other variant, such as an insertion or deletion) sequence is not required
 expensive oligonucleotide hybridization probes is not required
 modification of the primary sequence (i.e. introduction of a ?GC clamp?) to a PCR-generated amplicon to detect differences in melting behavior is not required
 method is easily automated using available equipment 
 simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples 
 necessary reagents may be combined in a single step 
 melting analysis may be repeated multiple times on a single sample to reduce statistical data variation 

State of Development:
 DNA melting analysis readily detects differences in the melting temperature between mixtures of DNAs having single base mismatches, deletions, or insertions and a perfectly based paired primary sequence  
 PCR-generated amplicons of 15-167 base pairs in length have been shown to be amenable to this technology/invention.  Even larger longer DNAs can be potentially used to discover sequence variants
 DNA amplicon concentrations are highly reproducible, with a coefficient of variation of 2.6%

Patent Status:
U.S. provisional patent application filed January 31, 2002

Further R&D Required:
Under the present proposal, the overall goal of the CRADA collaboration will involve the following:
1.	Further improvement of the technology/invention for high throughput applications including improved efficiency and sensitivity.	
2.	Developing improved melting parameters for larger PCR-generated DNAs for DNA melting analysis.
3.	Developing software to improve variant detection by DNA melting analysis.
