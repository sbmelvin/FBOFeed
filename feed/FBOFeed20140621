<DESC>The Missouri Army National Guard intends to award a contract in a sole source capacity to Gray Manufacturing Company, Inc., CAGE Code 51849, for two wireless mobile column lift systems with adjustable carriages.   <br>  <br> The requisitioner already has wireless lifts from this manufacturer (purchased two years ago) and the reason for the sole source scenario is because these lifts will be used together and communication would not be interchangeable if an outside source were to compete and obtain the award. <br>  <br> The MOARNG has competed and purchased wireless lifts from multiple sources in the past and will continue to do so in the future when the situation allows it.  <br>  <br> Questions and inquiries should be addressed to ryan.borgmeyer@us.army.mil.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

In the PWS the contractor shall describe the technical approach necessary to achieve the Government's performance objectives identified herein.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Variation in clinical practice is known to lead to significant difference in the cost of medical care. As indicated in the literature, using validated data at the individual provider and service level, variation will be reduced or eliminated over time to dramatically reduce costs and improve the experience of care for the patient. The Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) does not possess a well-defined mechanism to identify and quantify clinical variation and is seeking a solution from an outside source.</p>
<p>The offeror is encouraged to present innovative recommendations and approaches in their proposal as well as detailed costs involved.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Objectively improve the major metrics of inpatient quality and save significant costs by reducing clinical and operational variations at the individual provider (e.g., physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, independent duty corpsman, etc.), clinical service, and hospital levels.<br />2. Data analysis:<br />a. Work with the NMCSD Information Management and TRICARE Operations Departments to access and analyze the available clinical and resource consumption data. Data analysis will be performed on the NMCSD campus only. No remote access to military health system data is available. The contractor may also use publically available data for their analysis.<br />b. Use risk-adjusted methodology to assess multiple years of patient-level data to identify clinical variations of individual providers and clinical services.<br />3. Based on the data and Command's recommendation, select two services to participate in a pilot to identify drivers of clinical variation and produce the highest quality, most cost efficient outcomes.<br />4. Provide individual providers with actionable information to target cases with most effective and efficient outcomes to replicate best practices: <br />a. Provide each provider with objective, risk-adjusted data that demonstrates their resource consumption variation for each of the functional service groups (lab, pharmacy, etc.).<br />b. Provide each provider with resource consumption variations data for comparing performance and variation reduction with their peers.<br />c. Provide each provider and each clinical service with data for highest quality and most cost efficient resource consumption by clinical cohort (DRGs) for to develop or modify clinical practice guidelines based on patient acuity level.<br />d. Information provided will be in the form of charts and tables that display data including but not limited to costs associated to episodes of care grouped by primary diagnosis, orders (type and frequently) placed during each episode of care, length of stay, charges vs. length of stay comparison, individual variation reduction, service variation reduction, etc.<br />e. Provide clinical and operational data in an educational, non-threatening format to providers and hospital personnel.<br />5. Assess providers' diagnostic documentation and medical record ICD coding accuracies.<br />6. As providers begin to modify their practices, assess hospital operations and make recommendations for improvements where appropriate.<br />7. Develop a dashboard for providers to facilitate tracking optimal outcomes over time to secure and improve upon quality gains and cost reductions. The dashboard will provide real time data on improvements in clinical indicators by provider and by service to maintain a focus on continuous best practice improvements. The dashboard data should include but not be limited to physician (as a code, not name), ED decision to admit in hours, time from presentation in ED to procedure, critical care management, non-related procedures, promptness of consults, no orders or changes in 48 hours, chronic disease management, readmits, etc.<br />8. Work with the quality and productivity staff to enhance reporting and educational formats and hand off these data and educational functions for future implementations as appropriate.<br />9. Prepare and present a plan to extend clinical variation reductions across additional services and a plan to roll out clinical variation services to additional hospitals within the Region.<br />10. From date of award contractor will be able to complete the objectives within 12 weeks. The contractor may propose a shorter schedule that will be evaluated.</p>
<p>11. Written summary report: Provide written reports of data collected, results, actions taken, and recommendations along with bi-weekly status reports.</p>
<p>12. Contractor will provide onsite review of the program for suggestions and adjustments as needed to ensure success six months and one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>13. Contractor will remain available for telephonic consultation for one year from the date of the award.</p>
<p>14. Software/computer hardware: If the contractor solution includes software or computer that will be installed on Government owned computer assets:</p>
<p>a. Software and hardware must be DON Application and Database Management System (DADMS) approved. Systems that are not DADMS approved must be standalone and not tied to the NMCSD network.<br />b.
