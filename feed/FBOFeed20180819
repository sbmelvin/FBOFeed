HISTORY
The Vet Center Program is recognized as the first program to address the psychological and social sequela of combat and armed conflict related problems. Before the official recognition of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980, the Vet Center Program set the course for leading the Department of Veterans Affairs (DOVA) recognition and treatment of war-related PTSD. Authority for Readjustment Counseling to Vietnam Veterans originated from Public Law 96-22 and subsequent legislation amends readjustment counseling services. Current law authorizing readjustment counseling is contained in title 38 U.S.C. § 1712A. Under 38 U.S.C. § 1712(e)(3), contracting authority for readjustment counseling and related mental health services is effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and amounts that are provided for in appropriations Acts.  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
 Provide outdoor experience events conducive to building trust and developing peer support for All Era Veterans (AEV) as a continuum of care to treat combat related injuries, including those related to behavioral health. These outdoor experiences should provide an affirming and open forum for veterans with a history of Post-Traumatic Syndrome Disorder (PTSD) and other related trauma issues resulting from combat tour duty or any other Vet Center service eligible veteran issues. The outdoor experience event should assist in the veterans  recovery of personal and interpersonal confidence, self-esteem, and trust building relationships as it relates to their re-integration into their community and family with focus on continuum of care. 
NUMBER AND LENGTH OF OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE EVENTS
The contractor will conduct six (6) outdoor experience events to for a maximum of twenty (20) participants and two Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS) Therapists for a four (4) day period, per each outdoor experience event. This four-day period per event includes one day for airport travel and/or travel to the outdoor experience location and one day for return travel from the outdoor event location to the participants  home airport or designated drop off location. The total time for the actual outdoor experience event should be two (2) eight-hour days.  
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE AND OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE EVENT COMPLETION EXPECTATION
There will be six (6) outdoor experiences in as many different locations within RCS service area of the Pacific District 5 (California, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, America Samoa, Hawaii, Guam, Alaska) in a period of one (1) year. 
OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE EVENT LOCATIONS AND FACILITY EXPECTATIONS
The six (6) outdoor experience events should be held within the Pacific District 5 (California, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, America Samoa, Hawaii, Guam, Alaska) geographic locations to accommodate potential participants from the various District vet centers.  The preferred outdoor experience event location settings should best accommodate seasonal variations for outside activity.
The outdoor experience event is quasi-facility based; outdoor sports activities (hikes, rock-climbing, canoeing, backpacking, camping, etc.) should be woven into the program to facilitate group and individual assistance with the transitional recovery efforts for participants. The selected outdoor experience event locations and activities should accommodate ADA participants. The outdoor experience activities will allow for bonding between participants and for furthering the recovery process of the participants.

Statement of Work:
Contract Title.  
Durable Wall Containment Barrier System
Background.  
The Maintenance and Operations Section shops perform various maintenance and renovation activities throughout the facility. When these activities generate dust, they must be isolated from surrounding areas to reduce the risk of infection control issues. Containment is sometimes required to prevent the spread of dust. Currently, the shops build temporary containment before beginning work, using plastic sheeting and/or drywall depending on the work. This equipment would be used as containment barriers, providing better control of airflow and dust than the current method and be portable and reusable at work areas throughout the facility.
 Scope.

<SOLNBR>28321318R00000039
<ARCHDATE>09012018
<CONTACT>Melissa A Kloman, Contract Specialist, Email melissa.kloman@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate with the Microsoft Corporation (MC), located at 5404 Wisconsin Avenue, Chevy Chase, MD 20815 on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1. These authorities provide an exception to the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.
<p>SSA intends to acquire Microsoft Support Services for SSA's mission oriented information technology (IT) business functions and initiatives. This contract will provide SSA with critical resources and MC specialized expertise to support mission-critical enterprise projects, as well as leading-edge MC information technology services that will map Microsoft technology to SSA's business functions. MC will provide SSA with the support to implement future software upgrades/releases, forthcoming network design and planning, deployment of MC products and technologies within SSA's client/server environment; plan migration strategies; tune and optimize hardware and software configurations; and provide timely problem resolution. This contract will also obtain Microsoft Public Sector Enterprise Services, which includes but is not limited to Microsoft Consulting Services, Microsoft Premier Services and Digital Advisory from Microsoft in support of Customer, Federal and executive mandates. The objective of the customer-wide Microsoft Public Sector Enterprise Services is to provide all SSA components with a central contract vehicle to access the MC services that support the Customer's significant investment in the MC software purchased through the Customer's Microsoft Enterprise Licensing Agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, SSA will have direct access to MC consultants who shall have access to MC developers and source code, as well as access to internal MC business plans. Specifically, the contractor shall assist SSA in the follow areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Matching technology to business functions;<br />&bull; Knowledge transfer of Microsoft products, tools and technologies; <br />&bull; Best practice guidance on designing and planning; deployment and migration; and, tuning and optimizing current and future Microsoft products, tools and technologies; <br />&bull; Diagnosing and resolving Microsoft operating system software defects and limitations; and,<br />&bull; Counseling Best Practices on optimal positioning for current and future Microsoft operating system software to address SSA's evolving application requirements.</p>
<p>MC is the only known responsible source that has access to the proprietary software code, future software releases, and confidential planning documents and business plans. MC system engineers are uniquely qualified because they have advanced knowledge of strategic product technology, understanding of their applications, detailed understanding of MC systems design specifications, and understanding of MC source code. For these reasons the agency believes MC is the only source that can provide the level of support the agency requires.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for one year, with four one-year option periods (if exercised) and a six-month option to extend services (if necessary).</p>
<p>Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Verbal responses are not acceptable and the agency will not provide consideration to any responses in writing. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the agency's discretion.</p>

Proposals that do not respond to all requirements in the solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be significantly not compliant with the solicitation requirements, or reflects a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the work to be performed. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors.
(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government and whose offer is the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors. The quote with the lowest evaluated price will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Only if that quote is found to be technically unacceptable will the evaluation proceed to the quote with the next lowest evaluated price. This process will continue until the lowest priced technically acceptable quote is found. The following factors shall be used to evaluate technical acceptability of the lowest priced offeror: 
1.	TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH (non-price)
The Offeror must meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). 
2.	PAST PERFORMANCE (non-price)
Offerors will be evaluated on their recent (within the past 3 years) performance of relevant requirements as described in the SOW. Offerors should provide three (3) references for the same or similar work performed for Federal, State, and local government and private clients. An Offeror may also provide information on problems encountered on the identified projects and the offer’s corrective actions.  The Government will consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror’s past performance.  An offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance if the offeror has no record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available. 
3.	PRICE
A comparison of proposal pricing received in response to the solicitation will be made in order to make a determination of fair and reasonable pricing in accordance with the Firm Fixed Price nature of this acquisition action.
(CONTINUED ON NEXT PANEL)<BR><BR>(CONTINUED)

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors.

In the event the Contractor effects any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the changes will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.  The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual authorized to accept nonconforming work, waive any requirement of the contract, or to modify any term or condition of the contract.  The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally obligate Government funds.

<DESC><div style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD201800077 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-98. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325120 and the business size standard is 1000 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to contract on a sole source basis with Airgas USA LLC,  6055 Rockside Woods Blvd N, Ste 500, Independence, OH, 44131-2337 to provide Nitrogen Industrial Bulk.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This will be Base + 4 option years, this is a critical resource for the NIDDK; The Liquid Nitrogen (LN) is converted into gaseous form; a lack of gaseous liquid nitrogen can cause a safety hazard by interfering with the supply of inert safety gas for chemical reactions that will explode if exposed to air. In addition to the safety issue, LN is central to our experiments and storage of biological research materials. This requirement calls for automatic sensing via telemetry unit, and automatic filling when our 3000-gallon tank reaches 50 inches. Due to the critical nature of this resource, contractors must be able to respond to emergency delivery calls, around the clock (24hours/day, 7 days/week) with delivery on site. This tank must never go be empty, because that could cause catastrophic risk to human life, and predicate large-scale equipment failure of our multi-million-dollar NMR, Mass Spectrometry units, and Cryo EM's units in the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Automatic reading of LN levels, and delivery within 24 hours of our inventory reaching a pre-determined minimum level. There is currently a Telemetry unit in use, which must be compatible with the contracted vendor's system. If our unit, which is owned by the NIDDK, is not compatible the contractor must supply, install, and establish monitoring with their own unit at no additional costs to the NIDDK. Our objective for building 8 is a constant supply of nitrogen gas. NIDDK has a 3000-gallon tank on site that holds the LN, which is converted to vapor, then pumped to the in-house line in vapor phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TASKS AREAS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Task Area 1 <br />Delivery Schedule: Deliveries are to be made to 9000 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 8, loading dock area, where the outside tank resides. This is an existing tank that is installed, functioning, and is mechanically sound. The tank contains the telemetry unit, which is a Bulk Asset Monitor, Model Y78BAMUNIT-500, Serial Number 3802760.  At a minimum, deliveries to building 8 shall be made when our fill capacity is at 50 inches, or 50% of capacity. "Top Off" fills can be made in addition to the required fill at 50% capacity, if the vendor is already in the vicinity of building 8 and wishes to reduce their load prior to returning to their warehouse."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Task Area 2<br />Due to the critical nature of this resource, contractors must be able to respond to emergency delivery calls, around the clock (24hours/day, 7 days/week) with delivery on site within a minimum of 2 hours, and a maximum of 4 hours, of the call being made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Task Area 3<br />The vendor must provide delivery tickets with the actual volumes delivered at the time of delivery. Building 8 has a dedicated mail box mounted on the wall at the loading dock of bldg. If physical tickets are not available from the driver, then the delivery ticket must be emailed within 24 hours of the fill. The Purchase Order awarded will reflect the unit of measure provided on the official quote, and therefore, the unit of measure must be consistent on the quote, PO, delivery ticket, and the invoice. This is critical to ensuring that there are no delays in payment on the Purchase Order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Task area 4 <br />Conversion calculations for the Tank Capacity: The tank has a 3000-gallon capacity and is considered full at 125 inches.  This converts to 24 gallons per inch.  With a pre-set fill level of 50 inches, we calculate that there should be 1200 gals of LN still the tank. Even if there were a breach of the tank security, we feel this level to be sufficient should we require an emergency repair or fill of the tank.</p>

Buy American – Supplies (May 2014)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
“Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item”—
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is—
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.
“Component” means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.
“Cost of components” means--
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.
“Domestic end product” means—
(1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;
(2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if—
(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the agency determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic; or

(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.
(d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision of the solicitation entitled “Buy American Certificate.”<BR><BR>As prescribed in 25.1101(a)(2), insert the following provision:
Buy American Certificate (May 2014)
(a) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (b) of this provision, is a domestic end product and that for other than COTS items, the offeror has considered components of unknown origin to have been mined, produced, or manufactured outside the United States. The offeror shall list as foreign end products those end products manufactured in the United States that do not qualify as domestic end products, i.e., an end product that is not a COTS item and does not meet the component test in paragraph (2) of the definition of “domestic end product.” The terms “commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item,” “component,” “domestic end product,” “end product,” “foreign end product,” and “United States” are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled “Buy American—Supplies.”
