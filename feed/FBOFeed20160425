<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334515 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.
<p>AFRL requires QTY- 1 Single rack mount kit for FS725, QTY-1 Mainframe with RS-232 interface with opt 01, GPIB, QTY- 1 Rack mount kit for SIM900, QTY-1 Rubidium frequency standard, QTY-2 Rechargeable isolated voltage source, QTY-2 Replacement battery assembly, QTY-1 10 MHz AGC distribution amplifier 7 channel and QTY- 2 Electron Multiplier 200amu RGA with opt 01.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Stanford Research Systems. 1290-D Reamwood Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source has commercial offerings that can meet this requirement. The required trapped ion experiments require an ultrahigh vacuum environment to allow monitoring in each vacuum chamber setup with a partial pressure sensitivity of 5 x 10-14 Torr. The setup also requires a high quality frequency standard to generate 10MHz reference standards.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Brooke.Hoffman@us.af.mil . Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 20 May 2016.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>

<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease (NCIRD) has a requirement to maintain a BioXp 3200 System that was originally manufactured by Synthetic Genomics, Inc. Synthetic Dynamics does not authorize other vendors to maintain its products and receiving service from an unauthoried vendor would violate the warranty on the equipment - potentially costing significant time and resources to repair.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contract Officer, Reference 2015-80812, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: David Dombeck, MS: K-14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Agena Bioscience, 4755 Eastgate Mall, San Diego, California 92121-1971 to procure the following:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. Customer Site Engineering Support Event, Product Code: 69000, Quantity: One;<br />2. Premier Plan - MassARRAY&reg; Compact System, Product Code: 63006, Serial Number: BA060483, Quantity: One;<br />3.

Service Plan (Included) - Database Server, Product Code: 000-DBS, Quantity: One.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch/Molecular Genetics Section Investigators use a broad range of tools to understand how health and disease are related to genetic, genomic and metabolic variation. Investigators study a broad spectrum of disorders, from common diseases associated with common variants to the rarest diseases associated with uncommon, sometimes unique variants. Scientific Investigators sometimes study disorders that are not inherited at all, which are due to somatic mosaicism-a difference in genetic composition among cells in an individual. Additionally also study how the genome influences normal metabolic processes. MGMGB investigators apply tools ranging from high-throughput biology to clinical and animal research. A unifying theme in their research is that the human is the most complex, fascin MGMGB investigators use the rich resources and technologies of the Human Genome Project to develop more sophisticated ways of understanding pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of disease.ating and important system in which one can study the effects of heritable variation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this procurement is to procure Agena Bioscience MassARRAY System Premier Service Agreement. NHGRI for eighteen years have been engaged in a large collaborative study entitled FUSION (Finland - United States Investigation of NIDDM), in which more than 20,000 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (and suitable controls) from Finland are being studied, using careful phenotyping of diabetes and diabetes-associated quantitative traits, and genome-wide genetic linkage and association. Large numbers of additional samples are also now available from several collaborators around the world including the Broad Institute, Diabetes Genome Initiative and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. NHGRI/MGMGB have developed and applied new high throughput genotyping approaches in the laboratory using the Agena Bioscience platform, which have allowed the collection of a massive amount of data from these Finnish diabetics and their families. Following the genome wide association study (GWAS) approach, single nucleotide polymorphisms have been selected and genotyped using the Agena Bioscience platform at NHGRI, The Broad institute and The Wellcome Trust. NHGRI/MGMGB have now contributed to the identification of no less than 32 loci for T2D, and have identified additional loci harboring variants that have important effects on obesity, fasting glucose, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and adult height. Continuing these approach scientific investigators anticipate the need to continue this approach to identify additional loci for hundreds of more SNPs in T2D and quantitative trait associated loci. The use of the same platform at NHGRI, The Broad Institute and The Wellcome Trust decreases the complexity of analysis significantly and increases the probability of success. NHGRI/MGMGB require a service and maintenance agreement to support the continual operation of the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY System in order for scientific research investigators to achieve the above mentioned objectives.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Information:</span></p>
<p>NHGRI MGMGB have upgraded the genotyping capabilities in the Collins lab to increase throughput and versatility as well as lower the cost of high throughput SNP analysis. In increasing the versatility we are able to optimize the type of genotyping reaction to facilitate smaller studies with a large number of samples as well as larger numbers of SNPs on few samples for association discovery studies. NHGRI/MGMGB continues to use MassARRAY System in order to test as many as 36 SNPs in each multiplex reaction. The Agena Bioscience MassArray system contains custom characteristics that integrated with our genotype database and analytical software which has been developed over the past 10 years and this compatibility is not available from any other source. This system has been optimized in our laboratory for the FUSION study of genes related to type 2 diabetes (Project no. 1Z01HG000024 COLLINS, FRANCIS - Genetic analysis of type II diabetes in Finnish population).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agena Bioscience MassARRAY system include:</span></p>
<p>&bull; The system is capable of delivering up to 140,000 SNP genotypes a day.<br />&bull; Low sample quantity requirements so as to conserve DNA samples. (i.e. a very small amount)<br />&bull; The capacity to genotype up to 36 SNPs on ~20,000 samples (720,000 genotypes) in one week (i.e. a high throughput platform)<br />&bull; Complimentary assay design to share with collaborators<br />&bull; Compatibility with currently existing genotyping equipment at NHGRI/MGS<br />&bull; Compatibility with platform used at the Broad Institute and The Wellcome Trust<br />&bull; Customized database design that is incorporated into the existing MGS LIMS system</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:<br /><br /></span>Base Year: Twelve (12) months <br />Option Year 1: Twelve (12) months<br />Option Year 2: Twelve (12) months<br />Option Year 3: Twelve (12) months</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulatory Authority:</span></p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-87-2, April 6, 2016. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) at the amount not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) under $150,000.00.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for online access to the Chemical Abstracts Service&reg; (CAS&reg;) Databases through CAS's SciFinder&reg; platform.</p>
<p>SciFinder is a web-based interface that provides desk-top access to the proprietary chemical information contained in CAS databases. CAS is a division of the American Chemical Society. SciFinder is a research discovery application that provides unlimited access to the world's most comprehensive and authoritative source of references, substances and reactions in chemistry and related sciences produced, compiled, and updated daily by CAS scientists around the world. SciFinder integrates substances, reactions, references, regulatory and commercial availability information into a single, powerful tool that is indispensable to biomedical scientists and chemists engaged in new product and patent development as well as basic research.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists for this requirement. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The product is a commercial item as defined in FAR Part 2.101. The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) months base period, with options to renew for two (2) successive twelve month periods. It is believed that Chemical Abstracts Services (CAS) is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements" because of the following: Chemical Abstracts Services (CAS) is the only known source that owns the exclusive rights to sell, distribute or provide online access to the Chemical Abstracts Service&reg; (CAS&reg;) Databases through CAS's SciFinder&reg; platform being acquired under this requirement.</p>
<p>Below is the Draft Statement of Work. This is NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.

<p><br />DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>PROJECT TITLE: Access to Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Databases through a web-based interface</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Division of Library Services (DLS) currently facilitates access by NIH researchers to SciFinder, a critical information source for NIH researchers, through contract that allows interested NIH Institutes and Centers to obtain access to the resource for a flat annual fee. This umbrella contract provides staff across all participating institutes with unlimited access to the databases. <br /><br />SciFinder is a web-based interface that provides desk-top access to the proprietary chemical information contained in CAS databases. CAS is a division of the American Chemical Society. SciFinder is a research discovery application that provides unlimited access to the world's most comprehensive and authoritative source of references, substances and reactions in chemistry and related sciences produced, compiled, and updated daily by CAS scientists around the world. SciFinder integrates substances, reactions, references, regulatory and commercial availability information into a single, powerful tool that is indispensable to biomedical scientists and chemists engaged in new product and patent development as well as basic research. CAS indexes chemical articles from more than 50,000 journals, patents from 63 patent authorities, conference proceedings and meeting abstracts, technical reports, books, dissertations, reviews, electronic-only journals and web preprints. Its database contains more than 42 million abstracts.</p>
<p>The CAS Registry is the authoritative collection of disclosed chemical substance information with more than 108 million organic and inorganic substances and more than 66 million sequences.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement is to provide the NIH community with cost&shy; effective access to a gateway to search the proprietary and comprehensive databases of chemical information. This action provides a centralized license agreement that shall consolidate accounts from NIH participating institutes. As a result of the centralized licensing agreement, the NIH will be able to reduce the cost of obtaining access for each registered user.

<DESC>Project Summary: The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking qualified general contractors to perform a partial seismic upgrade and related improvements needed due to impact on architectural finishes and MEP systems at the Frank Hagel Federal Building, 1221 Nevin Avenue, Richmond, California. The award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds.
<p>The Frank Hagel Federal Building, which serves as the regional headquarters for the Social Security Administration (SSA), is located at 1221 Nevin Avenue in Richmond, California. The building complex consists of a six story office tower with penthouses and a one story auditorium that share a common podium slab and a one story basement. The basement, tower and auditorium were built in 1975 with a total area of approximately 630,000 square feet. A one story, 2,100 square foot day care center was built in 1996 on the same site as an independent addition.</p>
<p>The building complex does not currently meet the seismic safety standards for existing buildings that have been adopted by GSA, and hence the following key deficiencies will be retrofitted under this contract:</p>
<p>&bull; Steel moment frame and selected gravity system column splices within the office tower;<br />&bull; Steel moment frame base anchorage within the office tower;<br />&bull; Selected precast concrete cladding system attachments at the office tower; and <br />&bull; Auditorium roof framing supports at the interface with the office tower.<br />Construction of the structural improvements to the steel moment frames will impact architectural finishes and MEP systems. In the basement and at the 2nd and 4th floors, partitions and work stations will be removed around the steel moment frame and gravity columns to expose the column base and column splices. Finishes will be restored after the structural work has been completed. Impacts to MEP systems are minor, mainly consisting of temporarily supporting items attached to the partitions, and reinstalling them when the partition is restored.</p>
<p>Cladding system improvements will be performed from both the interior and exterior of the building. At the interior locations, wall finishes and part of the ceiling will be removed to expose the concrete cladding panels. After the new connections are installed, the partition and ceilings will be restored. At the exterior locations, the cladding connections will be accessed by means of coring holes through the panels. These holes as well as saw-cut slots to be provided at other locations in order to afford more movement between the panels, will require architectural closure and treatment. MEP and data shafts generally occur at the perimeter of the building, and as such will also be impacted by the cladding system improvements. Mechanical ducting, hot water and chiller lines as well as limited lighting controls and electrical panels will need to be relocated for access.</p>
<p>Some of the finishes and systems contain hazardous materials which will require abatement prior to their removal.</p>
<p>Construction will be performed in phases so as to allow for continued use of the building. Unused space in the basement will be improved and temporary space will be created in the Auditorium and sixth floor as part of the project to create the necessary office swing space. This work will consist of installation of new flooring and ceilings and repairs of existing wall finishes. Selected improvements will also be made in these areas to better accommodate the program, including reconfiguring partition walls, installation of access flooring, installation of new energy efficient lighting, and installation of new energy efficient HVAC terminals. Fire life safety systems will be reconfigured as needed, including replacement of sprinkler heads, fire-stopping at existing walls where required by code, and increasing exit capacity through upgrades to existing exiting via the garage driveway.</p>
<p>The cost of construction is estimated in the range of $18,000,000 to $23,000,000.</p>
<p>The period of performance is estimated to be thirty-three (33) months after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP) by the GSA Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Acquisition Strategy: This is a competitive acquisition source selection using the best-value trade-off process to award a firm fixed price contract. This procurement will be advertised for Full &amp; Open Competition. This source selection is based on FAR Part 15 and GSAM. The evaluation process will result in selection of the proposal that represents the best value for the Government in terms of technical and price factors as identified in the solicitation and in accordance with FAR Part 15.3.</p>
<p>RFP Requests: Contractors are to submit a written request for a copy of the RFP to: Beverly Chin, GSA, PBS, Acquisition Management Division (9PQ2CP), 50 United Nations Plaza, Third Floor South, Room 3685, San Francisco, CA 94102. Requests may be mailed or e-mailed: beverly.chin@gsa.gov. Refer to RFP No. GS-09P-16-KT-C-7002.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/PZIO Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing a Temptronic ATS-605 Thermal Forcing system for the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in order to replicate and compare research results to those in the academic anti-counterfeit community in accordance with the requirements of industry standards and applicable local, state, and Federal laws.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS and SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>The thermal forcing unit must adhere to the specifications listed below. Additionally, the installation is in a laboratory where space, noise, and chemical constraints exist. The installed system will meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide temperature range from [-10 to 200] degree Celsius; <br />&bull; Compatible with programming profiles for Temptronic ATS-6xx Thermostream units for consistency with established research efforts; <br />&bull; Bench-top operation, footprint of less than 36"x24"; <br />&bull; Ability to apply temperature range to localized components on circuit board (may require use of silicon insulating pads);<br />&bull; Less 80dB noise level meeting OSHA office environment requirements; and<br />&bull; Use of 115V 60Hz Power supply.</p>
<p>As a reminder, these are draft salient characteristics and technical requirements which are subject to be changed.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334512 - Automatic Environmental Control Manufacturing for Residential, Commercial and Appliance Use, with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates an acquisition for a Firm Fixed Price contract.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.<br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below. Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice. Failure to provide a complete response may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed via email to Ms. Kelsie Cooley, AFLCMC/PZIOA, at kelsie.cooley@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>Based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334512, size standard of 500 employees, please circle Yes or No as to whether your company is:<br />&#61607; Small Business (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Small Disadvantaged Business (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; 8(a) Certified (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; HUBZone Certified (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Veteran-Owned Small Business (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Women-Owned (WO) (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (Yes / No)<br />&#61607; Please indicate if your company is domestic or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).<br />&#61607; Indicate if you are the manufacturer or provide the name and size of the manufacturer of the product(s) you will be supplying.<br />&#61607; Please provide a statement that the respondent will allow or will not allow the Government to release proprietary data.

<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort: The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not been decided; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for small businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of providing a Temptronic ATS-605 Thermal Forcing system, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention All potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions:</p>
<p>1. Name of country where the components of the Temptronic ATS-605 Thermal Forcing system are manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.<br />3. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement. Include contract number and date, a brief description, agency/organization supported, and point of contact name and telephone number.<br />4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?<br />5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.<br />6. Describe your standard warranty and return process for goods and services furnished to the Government for items similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE:</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to provide the requested items to the primary point of contact listed below. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. As stipulated in Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse any costs incurred or associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />Responses are limited to 5 pages and may be submitted electronically to the following email address: kelsie.cooley@us.af.mil in a Microsoft Word compatible format or mailed to AFLCMC/PZIOA POC: Ms. Kelsie Cooley, 1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3 Building 1 Room 109, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5344 to be received no later than 5:00 pm, EST, Wednesday, April 27, 2016. Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Ms. Kelsie Cooley at kelsie.cooley@us.af.mil or 937-522-4581.</p>

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS DESIRES TO LEASE SPACE

The Government is seeking to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield approximately 6500 net usable square feet in the Northern Dutchess County, New York for use as a Community Based Outpatient Clinic.

The proposed delineated area is as follows:

North:	Rhinebeck/Staatsburg area from Fiddlers Bridge Road to 9 Partners Road to Pumpkin Lane 
South: 	U.S. State Route 55 and Firemen's Way 
East: 	Taconic Parkway
West: 	U.S. State Route 9

The space location should be accessible by public transportation. It shall be contiguous and on ground level not to exceed 6500 usable square feet. Parking shall be on site with a minimum of 20 spaces to include those with handicapped accessibility. The space shall be located in a modern quality building of sound and substantial construction with a facade of stone, marble, brick, stainless steel, aluminum or other permanent materials in good condition.

The space must be ADA compliant and can be provided by new construction or modification of an existing space. If not a new building, the space offered shall be in a building that has undergone, or will complete by occupancy, modernization or adaptive reuse for the Space with modern conveniences. 

The space must meet or be able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs Life and Fire Safety, Seismic and Sustainability Standards and other applicable regulations.  A 10 year lease (5 year firm, 5 years soft) will be considered.  The VA seeks a gross lease that includes, but not limited to the following:

Heating system maintenance and repair		Electrical system maintenance and repair
Plumbing maintenance and repair		All Utilities: Electric, Heat, Sewer, Water
Real Estate Taxes				Landscaping	
Window cleaning				Common area supplies
Garbage removal				Snow removal	Pest control	
Common area maintenance			Sight lighting	
Insurance					Lawn sprinkler

*VA will be responsible for its own janitorial/housekeeping services for the internal space it occupies*

All commercial office/clinical space within the geographic area in Northern Dutchess County, NY will be considered. Only space that is identified as economically advantageous to the Government will be considered relative to relocation, potential build out and/or rent. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. A cost comparison will be performed in relation to the expenses incurred at the current location.
 
A market survey of the properties offered for lease will be conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. All interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) must provide written acknowledgement NO LATER THAN Monday, May 16, 2016 4:30pm EST. 

Additional requirements include:

Shall be built to VA specifications

<CONTACT>Rodriguez, Diane
<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  

Proposed Project:

The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, has a requirement for the upgrade of the Brock Reservoir Outlet Pipe Cathodic Protection System.  The Work consists of the removal of the existing system and installation of a new cathodic protection system and spot recoating of the interior of the two 9 foot diameter steel outlet pipes.  Each of the existing steel outlet pipes are is approximately 890 feet in length.  Installation of a new cathodic protection system and spot recoating, must be completed without adversely affecting the existing pipe coating system.  The exterior steel surface of the pipe is protected by polyurethane coating, approximately  30 mils thick.  The existing cathodic protection system runs the full length of both each pipes. The interior steel surfaces of each pipe is protected with an epoxy paint circa 2010.  The existing galvanic anode cathodic protection system has an anode support system that is failing, resulting in a loss of magnesium anodes and causing abrasive damage to the epoxy coating of the outlet pipes.  The loss of anodes combined with the damage to the coating system will lead to an increased risk of damage to the steel outlet pipes and possible leaks. 

Work is located approximately 25 miles West of Yuma, Arizona in Imperial County, California.

Principal Components of Work

Contractor is responsible for managing driver hours, and for keeping FEMA apprised of any shortages or pitfalls that may be encountered.  <br />Contractor may be asked to continue or execute resupply of the FSA as previously mentioned in the "Inbound commodities and resources" section.<br />Contractor Management:<br />Contractor will able to provide 24 hour management support on site that has decision making capability as it relates to normal shuttle operations, including dispatch, driver/truck acquisition, repairs, dismissing drivers/trucks, and seeing to drivers' daily needs. On site managers must have 24 hour support from executive level authority management (i.e. vice president or equivalent). <br />Contractor may be required by FEMA Region IV to provide executive level authority support at the RRCC at FEMA Region IV, Atlanta, or other designated site. Executive level support must have complete decision making authority without having to go to other people(s) or entities. At FEMA's convenience, this position may function virtually, provided that the executive level (i.e. VP) individual is ALWAYS immediately available via phone and has immediate email access.</p>
<p>Range and Scope of operation:<br />Shuttle fleet will be able to operate 24 hours a day, although exact hours of operation will be determined by the requirements of the mission. Fleet will operate covering the states covered by the FSA and support operations. These operations can also include yard operations/management at the FSA to include staging and parking of trailers, trailer inventory, and flow management. <br />Contractor needs to be prepared to operate an immediate service area of a 300 miles (per day) radius of the FSA. While the FSA will have a functional operating radius of up to 300 miles, FEMA will have authority to utilize the shuttle fleet for any movement (including use of vendor/contractor holding yards and/or terminals) within the continental United States. This is provided for improved service and retrograde flexibility. There is no guarantee of the use of the shuttle fleet for retrograde.<br />Contractor will be able to provide emergency equipment service at the FSA if needed. This service is twofold in its purpose. 1. To maintain the contractors ability to provide service according to the contract (this represents a cost of doing business for the contractor. 2. FEMA may direct the contractor to provide emergency repairs to FEMA owned or leased trailers. FEMA directed repairs would be chargeable to FEMA. Contractor would provide copies of all parts and labor invoices for such charges.<br />Contractor will be able to provide at least one yard hostler if requested by the FSA or FEMA Region IV.<br />Contractor may be asked to provide "hot shot" service during the mission in support of the FSA or related facilities. This "hot shot" service is potentially separate from normal shuttle operations as it may have different pick-up and drop-off locations than normal mission needs. For example, it may be necessary to have contractor pick up specialized equipment from an outside source and deliver it to the disaster theater. This would make the "hot shot" run outside of normal routine shuttle/FSA operations, but would still be controlled by the FSA or the RRCC.</p>
<p>C.	Retrograde<br />Contractor will be required to provide, at the time of quote, the cost of long distance line haul rates that may be used instead of shuttle rate for retrograde. FEMA RIV decides on what system (shuttle rates or line haul rates) will be utilized for retrograde.<br />Retrograde includes not only the movement of commodities back to various, previously mentioned DCs, but occasionally, other sites that FEMA indicates. It also includes the movement of trailers that are retrograded to DCs (or other sites) that are not FEMA owned or leased, and NOT provided by the contractor, being taken to drop yards in the city/location proximate to the DC of unload.</p>
<p>Trailers:<br />Empty trailers provided by the contractor are considered immediately returned to vendor once that trailer is empty at the DC/unload site, provided contractor is the instrument for transportation (i.e. Atlanta, Fort Worth, Frederick, Cumberland).</p>
<p>IN ALL ASPECTS OF TRANSPORTATION - Contractor is required to:<br /> The contractor is to provide shuttle drivers that are U.S. Citizens, have a working command of the English language, and have the proper licensing and insurance for the vehicles they are driving. Contractor is responsible for all driver care. Contractor and drivers must adhere to all Federal requirements and host facility requirements (i.e. Fort Bragg, Maxwell AFB, etc.). Contractor must supply means of contact with driver via cell phone or immediate dispatcher response between Driver and FEMA FSA contact. <br /> Contractor must maintain a driver log daily that includes a record of driver/truck availability, times in and out of FSA, dispatch log, BOLs, and a record of trailer drops. Examples of suitable logs will be provided as an attachment. If a dispatched driver/truck is out of service for any reason, the FEMA COTR must be notified immediately. Signed BOLs must be maintained and copies provided to FEMA for billing accountability. FEMA reserve the right to refuse payment for any claimed delivery without suitable signed BOL (and/or State documents) proof. Documentation must be available as close to "real-time" as possible for ongoing reconciliation.<br /> Contractor is responsible for being able to increase the shuttle fleet size by a minimum of 20 units per operational period. An operational period is 12 hours; therefore, the contractor needs the capacity to increase by a minimum of 40 units in a 24 hour period. Contractor will decrease the fleet size at whatever rate FEMA requests.<br /> Prior to billing, contractor will provide FEMA with an itemized listing of charges, by category, for audit purposes, to be reconciled in order to pay the "final" approved bill quickly. This "pre-bill" will be submitted to logistics in advance of actual invoicing. This pre-bill will be agreed upon by both FEMA and the contractor prior to invoicing. <br /> NOTE: When quoting this or any mission, ALL QUOTES will be based on the Department of Energy fuel price index or equivalent. http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/ NO FSC will be accepted or paid without supporting documentation demonstrating an increase in fuel prices after the time of the initial quote. FSC is NOT to be built into the initial quote structure.</p>
<p>Quotes must contain the following information when applicable:<br />1.	Cost of shuttle power unit and driver per 24 hour period (solo)<br />2.	Cost of Shuttle power unit and TEAM per 24 hour period (team)<br />3.	Acquisition rate of shuttle power unit and driver, if any<br />4.	Demob rate of shuttle power unit and driver, if any<br />5.

Worth, Fredrick, Cumberland).<br />13.	Cost of holding an independents trailer at contractors holding yards in the above mentioned market cities, if any.<br />14.	Specific listing of other costs not mentioned above that will be known and chargeable.<br />Cross Dock Operations:<br />Cross Dock Service Provider (CDSP) will provide a facility capable of cross docking ____X____ number of loaded trailers of commodities/product from Van/Reefer trailers to CDSP leased or FEMA owned trailers. Cross docking should be accomplished at a rate of at least _____ per hour. The cross dock facilities need to be within ninety (90) minute drive time to the FSA (Federal Staging Area).</p>
<p>Locations:<br />Possible FSAs will be located in the locations previously mentioned.</p>
<p>Definitions<br />CDSP = Cross Dock Service Provider<br />Cross Docking Operation = takes product from a truck/trailer and moves that material in its entirety to another trailer or container that FEMA has control of. The receiving trailer/container is either leased by the CDSP or a FEMA owned trailer.<br />Dedicated Terminal = is a cross dock solely used by FEMA. No other operations take place at that terminal.  <br />LIVE TERMINAL = is a cross dock still in use by the service provider or other entity. FEMA commodities are NOT the only products being moved at this terminal. Live terminals are not recommended and must be approved by FEMA Region IV Logistics Distribution Manager prior to implementation.<br />Co-located FSA and Cross Dock = A Dedicated Cross Dock facility that has sufficient hardstand to accommodate both the cross dock operation and the FSA. This is desirable so long as the location has suitable ingress and egress, good proximity to the affected area, and meets the needs of mission requirements. Combining an FSA operation with cross docking at a live terminal is not recommended.<br />Cross Dock Operation:<br />The cross dock operation takes commodities and products from inbound suppliers, moves the commodities from the inbound trailer, and transfers those commodities to a trailer that the CDSP provides or a trailer that FEMA RIV that will be controlled by FEMA (transfer to a FEMA owned trailer is advisable if available). <br />A dedicated cross dock is preferred. A segregated section of a live terminal may be accepted but requires FEMA Region IV approval.<br />Contractor will provide a minimum capability of 10 consecutive or cross located dedicated doors and appropriate labor and management capable of cross docking 5 trailers simultaneously at an average rate of twenty (20) minutes/trailer. Time period required all physical and information/documentation be completed. The "new" trailer will then be dispatched to the FSA and inbound trailer that is now empty, dismissed.<br />Ability to scale up to ten (10) trailers/hour if required.</p>
<p>Facility<br />&#61565;	Facility should have reliable electrical power, easy ingress and egress for trucks and equipment. <br />&#61565;	Enough yard space for staging inbound trailers to be cross docked as well as staging of vendor provided empty trailers prior to cross dock operation. Space for 150 trailers is required with enough room for maneuverability. Sufficient operating room for substantial traffic flow. <br />&#61565;	1200 Square feet of office space/area for FEMA staff to utilize at the cross dock facility.<br />&#61565;	Trash service - i.e. dumpster<br />&#61565;	Bathroom facilities (Port-a-potty minimum) capable of servicing 10 FEMA {per shift}, CDSP crew, and drivers. <br />&#61565;	Facility should have temporary phone, DSL min, with 24 hours' notice. This service is for the contractor. {Provider is fully responsible for the cost and implementation}<br />&#61565;	Provider needs to be able to add phone and internet {T1} service for FEMA, ONLY IF FEMA specifically requests it. <br />&#61565;	Security - Facility should be fenced as to strongly discourage intruders and provide complete control over access to the operation. Entrance and exit gates under the operational command of FSA manager.<br />&#61565;	Provider will have approved security for the site, having 24 hour coverage. Security is responsible for gate and interior security. <br />&#61565;	Flexibility - Adapt to a constantly changing environment and demands. Personnel able and willing to do whatever task is needed to complete the mission successfully.<br />&#61565;	24 hour operations capable.<br />&#61565;	12 hour shift (requires 1 to 2 hour overlap for smooth transition)<br />&#61565;	Scalable quickly up or down.</p>
<p>Additional Equipment Support:<br /> CDSP will provide ALL necessary equipment and support for the movement of product at the cross dock operation. Items include but not limited to, forklifts with operators, hostlers, covered cross dock facility, load restacking capacity, pallet jacks, dunnage, yard equipment for moving commodities, staging areas for trailers with commodities, and any additional support that FEMA and the ISB operation may need to be successful. <br />CDSP will provide transport of cross docked trailers to the FSA. This will be done through use of a "Shuttle Fleet" (See Shuttle Fleet SOW).</p>
<p>Trailers:<br />CDSP will provide (unless FEMA provides), either by leasing or from internal, organic assets, trailers that are 53', Dry Van, reefer, or container, with "Barn Doors", and satellite tracking that is preinstalled on the trailer/container. Reefers and/or containers are only to be leased at FEMA's request OR be provided at the less expensive dry van cost. {All quotes should have specific line items for Dry Van, Reefer, and container (48' or 53').} Tracking can be through Qualcomm, Skybits, or equivalent. CDSP is responsible for ensuring that leased trailers are on site, ready for use by the cross dock mission.<br />Trailers are to be inspected prior to receipt. CDSP is responsible for all physical damage to trailers. Any issues need to be handled between the trailer leasing company and the CDSP. <br />Lease trailers are the sole responsibility of the CDSP. FEMA RIV will not accept any responsibility for damage, maintenance, or liability as the SP is responsible for the cross dock and transport of those trailers. If FEMA directs that the trailer be turned over to another party (Region, contractor, etc.), then a record of the condition of the trailer must be made and the FEMA/3rd party will assume responsibility for said trailer.</p>
<p>Cross Dock Information<br /> The data transfer of information will need to consist of the following:<br />&#61565;	Receiving Sequence Number (Order unit arrived at the cross dock entrance gate.)<br />&#61565;	Date and time received.<br />&#61565;	Name and phone # of driver<br />&#61565;	Tractor #<br />&#61565;	Trailer # (Nose number, not tail number)<br />&#61565;	Transponder ESN#<br />&#61565;	Trailer Seal #<br />&#61565;	Commodity<br />&#61565;	BOL Qty.<br />&#61565;	Dock Door assigned<br />&#61565;	New trailer #.<br />&#61565;	New trailer Dock Door #.<br />&#61565;	New Transponder ESN#.<br />&#61565;	New Seal #.<br />&#61565;	Commodity verification.<br />&#61565;	Cross docked by: (name).<br />&#61565;	Cross dock date.<br />&#61565;	Cross Dock time.<br />&#61565;	Notes:<br />The above information needs to be correctly collected, and transmitted to the FEMA crew electronically. Excel format is strongly recommended. Other formats may be acceptable with prior approval.<br />Please see the FEMA Region IV FSA and Cross Dock Guide, Version 3.6, for overall process flow and operational format.<br /> <br />Other Duties<br />Aside from the typical cross dock activities, the CDSP may be asked to participate in other tasks necessary to properly complete the mission. Other activities can include, but are not limited to product inspection, custom loading of trailers, reconstituting broken loads, and other activities necessary to complete the cross dock mission in support of survivors.</p>
<p>Leadership<br /> Service provider must have executive level representation at the RRCC if requested by FEMA. This person will have complete decision making capability<br /> At FEMA's convenience, this position may function virtually, provided that the executive level (i.e. VP) individual is ALWAYS immediately available via phone and has immediate email access.<br /> CDSP will insure that an experience and seasoned management team and crew operate the cross dock facility, including the cross dock operation itself, yard control, and shuttle operations. The Cross Dock manager should have complete authority for all routine operational decisions, and have immediate reach back to superiors should the need arise.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Hosted Payload Opportunities and Accommodations for the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA)
<SOLNBR>SS_MAIA_HOST
<RESPDATE>052016
<CONTACT>Robert Bradley Gardner, Phone 7578642525, Email Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov - Timothy P. Cannella, Supervisory Contracting Officer , Phone 7578645028, Email timothy.p.cannella@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder Program Office (ESSPPO) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for LEO Hosted Payload Opportunities and accommodations for the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA).
<p>As part of the Earth Venture Program, NASA's Earth Science Division (ESD) is developing Earth Science Instruments to be flown as hosted payloads on Hosted Payload Opportunities (HPO's). The development of the instruments as well as the HPO's will be conducted independently of each other with the goal of matching a specific instrument with a specific HPO by the instrument Preliminary Design Review (PDR) timeframe (mid to late 2017).</p>
<p>One of the latest selections of the Earth Venture Program is MAIA, an Earth Venture Instrument-3 (EVI-3) selection, cost capped at $101M. MAIA is currently planned to be delivered in mid-2019 and operate for a three-year mission duration. The objective of the MAIA investigation is to assess linkages between different particulate matter (PM) types and adverse birth outcomes, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and premature deaths. Concentrations of fine, coarse, sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon, black carbon, and mineral dust particles will be retrieved in major urban areas on a 1-km grid.</p>
<p>The MAIA instrument requires modest spacecraft accommodation requirements, which allow flexibility in choice of host platform and orbit altitude. Two identical pushbroom cameras incorporating an accurate spectropolarimetric detection system are mounted on a 2-axis gimbal to provide frequent, multi-angle imaging of major cities around the world. As a gimbaled pointed instrument, MAIA will exert a torque on the spacecraft when gimbaling its camera from one target to the next. Gimbal disturbance torques are estimated to be below 0.05 N-m.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in identifying hosted payload opportunities, and their associated accommodations, for the MAIA mission in order to develop a future solicitation to acquire the host opportunity for MAIA.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to:<br />1) Identify the HPO's for the period from 2019-2023;<br />2) Obtain an estimated cost and funding profile for the opportunity</p>
<p>MAIA consists of two boresighted pushbroom cameras (Fig. 1) which measure the intensity of reflected sunlight in 12 spectral bands. Camera pointing is achieved using a 2-axis gimbal (Fig. 2). An instrument block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Additional MAIA Hosted Payload Opportunity Requested Information:</p>
<p>Please identify your organization's HPO's for the period of 2019-2023 with their associated mission parameters including but not limited to:<br />&bull; Mission Name<br />&bull; Launch Date<br />&bull; Host Provider / Partnership<br />&bull; Payload Environment<br />o Temperature Range<br />o Quasi-static loads<br />o Minimum resonant frequency<br />o Random vibration and acoustic loads<br />o Shock environment<br />o Disturbance torque<br />o RF Field EMI/EMC/In-Space Charging<br />&bull; Launch Vehicle<br />&bull; Contract closure date relative to Launch Date<br />&bull; Instrument delivery date required relative to Launch Date<br />&bull; Rough Order of Magnitude Price Estimate to fly and operate the instrument. In addition to the total price, please estimate the following components:<br />o Integration, Test, and Launch<br />o Operations<br />&bull; Any concerns with FAR Part 12 terms and conditions<br />&bull; Logistical considerations and constraints for operating the instrument<br />&bull; Additional terms and conditions regarding payload liability, indemnification, and payload structure.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis will be reviewed/evaluated by both civil servants and support service contractors.</p>
<p>Technical questions should be directed to Diane Hope at &lt;Diane.L.Hope@nasa.gov&gt;. All other questions should be directed to Brad Gardner at &lt;Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov&gt;. All responses shall be submitted to Brad Gardner at &lt;Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov&gt; no later than May 20, 2016. Respondents may e-mail files up to 10MB in size to Brad Gardner; respondents shall submit larger files on optical storage media (CD/DVD) via postal mail to the following address:</p>

If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought - Burn Treatment and Skin Repair Phase 2 Clinical Trial <br /><br />1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION: The following notice constitutes a Sources Sought Notice and a Notice of Intent to sole source in accordance with FAR 5.203(a), 5.205 and 19.202-2. The government is seeking responses from potential sources to meet this requirement, however, if no other capable sources are identified, it is the Government's intent to award a sole source contract to Stratatech Corporation, 510 Charmany Drive, Ste 169, Madison, WI 53719-1262, for the requirement outlined in this notice.
<p>This is a notification that the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMDAA) intends to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>2.0 DISCLAIMER: This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained.</p>
<p>3.0 SUBJECT: In support of the USAMMDA's mission to develop medical products to protect and sustain the Warfighter, this request for information is seeking entities interested in performing a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic skin substitute containing both an epidermal and dermal layer for the treatment of complex, full-thickness skin injuries.</p>
<p>4.0 DESCRIPTION: Military operations pose a risk of skin injury from thermal, chemical, or mechanical insults which have not abated over the course of the last several conflicts to include the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Weapons with an incendiary component or high energy transfer (i.e., improvised explosive devices [IED], grenades, or high velocity rounds), comprise the obvious threat during conflicts. However, non-combat causes of injury in the deployed environment are a persistent challenge as well (e.g., burning refuse, handling volatile fuels, regular use and maintenance of generators, and handling explosives such as ammunition, flares, and grenades).</p>
<p>While burns may be the prevalent skin injury, other types of injury present substantial challenges for skin coverage. High velocity weapons and explosive devices have the potential to cause very large avulsion wounds as energy transfer from the weapon to the body strips away soft tissue. The Service Members (SMs) with such injuries may not have healthy donor sites with enough remaining tissue to provide adequate skin coverage of their wounds using the current standard of care, autografting. Severe skin injuries are medical-resource intensive injuries requiring specialized personnel for management, prolonged hospital stays and costly treatments. Further, the disabilities incurred result in losses of unit-fighting strength. These high costs, in combination with the commitment to restore wounded SMs to health, are driving the imperative to find new technologies, particularly skin replacement and regeneration capabilities, for improving the treatment of these wounds and their outcomes.</p>
<p>This request for information is seeking entities interested in performing a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic skin substitute containing both an epidermal and dermal layer for the treatment of complex, full-thickness skin injuries. Specifically, the Government is seeking a company with established and successful experience in late stage clinical testing of complex biologic products. The Government expects that the interested entity will either manufacture or be able to procure a full-thickness, allogeneic skin substitute that has sufficient clinical safety data to support proceeding into a phase 2 clinical trial. The product must be universal, off-the-shelf and have sufficient stability data to support execution of the phase 2 clinical trial. The Government expects initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial no later than October 2016.</p>
<p>5.0 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: All responses to this notice shall be via e-mail to the point of contact below. Telephone questions or inquiries will not be answered or accepted. Entities interested in submitting a response must furnish in writing, a 2-3 page (not including cover page, index or list of references) synopsis of their capability to perform the tasks described above, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate of the cost to perform the services. Companies responding to this notice must provide complete contact information (Company name, Address, Point of Contact, telephone, email address, CAGE Code and DUNS number). Responders must identify their company's business size (based on the NAICS size standard), business status (i.e. small business, disadvantaged, HUB zone, woman owned, service disabled veteran owned). Please also include information regarding any prior experience with U.S. Government contracts and favorable experience working with the FDA. Responders must have an active profile in in the System for Award Management (SAM) and must have current representations and certifications uploaded into their active SAM profile. See https://www.sam.gov for details/instructions.</p>
<p>Responses must be sent to later than 4:00PM Eastern Time on 10 May 2016.</p>
<p>6.0 SUBMISSION POINT OF CONTACT: Interested entities shall forward submissions to Dana Kavitski, Contract Specialist, at dana.kavitski.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Warfighter Directorate intends to award a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to Hills, Inc., located at 7785 Ellis Road, West Melbourne, FL 32904-1105, under the authority as prescribed in FAR 13.106(b)(1). The requirement is for polymer distribution plate (cross-section designs) designs for use on uniquely built and very specialized small scale research and development tri and bi-component thermoplastic fiber-spinning machines that they have designed and fabricated for Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) by Hills, Inc. The polymer distribution plate designs are based on Hills proprietary technology and can only be used with their uniquely designed tri and bi-component extrusion equipment.
<p>The items being acquired are designed exclusively by Hills and can only be used with the two extrusion units that Hills, Inc. designed for NSRDEC.

<p>The USCGA requires the support of commercial partners to identify and engage college bound students with the interest and aptitude to succeed as cadets and officers. To develop a pool of interested students, USCGA employs several strategies. One is the use of commercial online technologies THAT help connect students with colleges that match their needs. Many of these technologies are also designed to help colleges identify students that match the college's enrollment needs. These technologies are well suited to help USCGA identify qualified prospects with the academic preparation, intellectual and athletic capacity, and leadership potential necessary to succeed as a cadet, as well as interest in STEM degrees the Coast Guard seeks in its officer corps.</p>
<p>Of these commercial firms, Hobson's is uniquely positioned to market the Coast Guard Academy to college students because it operates the largest high school based college planning system in the United States, Naviance. It is the only firm that can deliver Academy content to the students and educators using this system - when students start searching with their Guidance Counselor.<br /><br />For any question or concerns with this notice please contact the Admissions Point of Contact:<br />Ms.&nbsp; Susan Bibeau @ (860)701-6782.</p>

The Executive Administrator authorizes inspections at the MWEOC to prevent the possession and use of items prohibited by these rules and regulations or by other applicable laws, to prevent theft of property and to prevent the wrongful obtaining of classified information under 18 U.S.C. 793. If individuals object to such inspections, they must tell the officer on duty at the access point prior to entering the MWEOC.

Per the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HPSD-12), the MWEOC will grant unescorted access on the basis of a secure and reliable form of identification that can be authenticated electronically.<br />D. All visitors and guests will be screened to determine if they meet eligibility requirements for access into a FEMA space.<br />E. All visitors and guests must be sponsored by an approved MWEOC sponsor before they are granted access to the facility.<br />F. All individuals entering the MWEOC must be properly identified and in possession of a valid credential or access badge.<br />G. While inside the MWEOC, individuals must at all times conspicuously display their credentials/access badge between their neck and waist.<br />H. Individuals must secure their FEMA identity credential or access badge from view upon exiting the facility.<br />I. Law enforcement officials may retain custody of their firearms while visiting the MWEOC in the performance of their official duties upon proper display of verifiable law enforcement credentials.<br />J.

This request can be made by submitting a properly completed Mount Weather Access Application. Deliveries to the warehouse receiving area are authorized between the hours of 0700 - 1500 Monday - Friday, with the exception of federal holidays. Deliveries requested at other times must be arranged (by the requester of delivery) directly with warehouse personnel (540-542-2072) and will depend on the availability of the MWEOC staff.</p>
<p>III. Requesting Access <br />A. Day and Emergency Visitors, sponsored vendors, contractors and delivery drivers.<br />1. Contracting Officers/Specialist (CO/CS), Contracting Officer Representatives (COR) or Government Points of Contact (GPOC) will provide notification of all individual visitors and completed request forms to the MWEOC Area A Access office by submitting a properly completed Mount Weather Access Application twenty-four (24) hours in advance of desired arrival (for non-emergency events).<br />2.

The sponsoring CO/CS, COR or GPOC will decide if it is in the best interest of the government to offer litigation to the denied applicant.<br />B. No guests or visitors will be billeted at MWEOC unless they have been granted unescorted access<br />C. Facility access requirements may change with little or no notice based on changes to the prevailing threat situation.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-4, CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2015) is applicable.</p>
<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS. (JAN 2016) is applicable and the following identified clauses are incorporated by reference: 52.219.28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.223-18, 52.225-1, 52.225-13, 52.232-33</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Evaluation Process<br />The Government will perform a technical and price evaluation, based on the Quoter's written submission, to assess the "best value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each quoter's written technical submission will be reviewed and evaluated on an adjectival basis, for each of the technical evaluation factors. Simple statements of compliance/reiteration (i.e., "understood"; "will comply"), without a detailed description of how compliance will be met, may not sufficiently demonstrate a quoter's ability to meet the technical requirements and may result in a rating of "fail". Technical evaluations will be conducted using the adjectival ratings and definitions provided below.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Government will evaluate offers in response to this request in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 procedures.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible responder whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical Capability:<br />Technical responses shall contain sufficient content for the Government to determine whether quoters understand and have experience with the SOW requirements. Written responses for this section will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria listed below. These factors will be evaluated as pass/fail and past performance and price will not be evaluated if the vendor fails this area.</p>
<p>Factor 1. Additionally, to demonstrate understanding, the quoter shall propose sound, practical, and feasible methods to accomplish all tasks of the Statement of Work (SOW), within the stated period of performance. For technical approach purposes, quoters shall describe a technical approach in the SOW that supports the requirement. Demonstrated understanding and experience also includes the extent to which the quoter understands the detailed service requirements identified in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 2. Document capabilities and procedures to support product compliance with the NIEHS Standard Specification for Open Formula Rat and Mouse Ration, 18% Crude Protein Autoclaveable (NIH-31) - Attachment II.</p>
<p>Factor 3. Facilities and Equipment - demonstrate availability of necessary equipment and supply resource to provide the Rodent Feed in accordance with the solicitation requirement (e.g. manufacturing and warehouse facilities, production and warehouse facility grounds, and equipment and machinery as stated in standard specification). A site inspection by the Government may be required as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>Factor 4. Quality Assurance, Inspection, and Test Procedures - document capabilities to support compliance with quality assurance, inspection, and test procedures.</p>
<p>(ii) Price Evaluation</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate the total proposed price of performing this work (base and all options - for both price quotes), in accordance with the price evaluation section of the RFQ. The Government will evaluate the option under FAR 52.217-8 at award.</p>
<p>Price will not be rated adjectivally, but will be evaluated based on a comprehensive review, in accordance with the pricing content and instructions section above, and as described below.</p>
<p>Price quotes will be evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness based on information submitted in the written submission. This process will involve verification that figures are correctly calculated, prices are presented in the requested format, and that proposed rates and any applicable discounts are accurate.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government may utilize one or more of the following methods to evaluate price:</p>
<p>&bull; Review of the proposed level of effort and associated pricing;<br />&bull; Analysis of proposed labor mix;<br />&bull; Comparison to other quotes received;<br />&bull; Comparison and/or analysis based on Independent Government Cost Estimate;<br />&bull; Price Realism; and/or<br />&bull; Comparison/Analysis to historical cost.</p>
<p>As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate the Option to Extend Services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by dividing the 12-month option period total by two (2), and adding the calculated six-month total to the quoter's total proposed price. Thus, for the purpose of evaluation, the quoter's total price will include the base period, all optional periods and the optional extension of services period. Though, quoters are only required to price the base and option periods and shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services period.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each quoter's past performance based upon customer satisfaction with the services provided on past or current projects.</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance.</p>
<p>(a) Quoters shall identify, in detail, three (3) contracts, no more than five (5), which have recently been performed (within the last 3 years), or are currently being performed, which are similar in scope for services of this magnitude and complexity. The quoter shall provide the following information with respect to each of these contracts:</p>
<p>1. Contract number, Task Order number (if applicable), project title &amp; description of the project</p>
<p>2. Total contract value and type of contract<br />3. Date of contract award and period of performance<br />4. Government Agency/Organization Name<br />5. Name, address and telephone number of all applicable contract points of contact<br />6. Brief description of contract work, scope, and responsibilities <br />7. Brief narrative as to how the reference relates to this effort.</p>
<p>As part of past performance evaluation, Past Performance will be evaluated using recent and relevant information obtained from the references provided by the responder as well as past performance information independently obtained by the Government. Past Performance will be evaluated and given of rating of "Acceptable", "Unacceptable", or "Neutral" as defined below. Recent and relevant Past Performance is defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, paragraph 2.b. The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the quoter. Also, references other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award proposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful responder within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) Rating Definitions:</p>
<p>Definitions of Ratings for Technical Capability:<br />Pass. Quote meets or exceeds all specified requirements, demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirement, and proposes a sound, practical, and feasible approach to accomplish the requirements of the Statement of Work.<br />Fail. Quote does not meet requirements, has not demonstrated an adequate approach, or does not demonstrate an acceptable understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Definitions of Ratings for Past Performance:</p>
<p>Acceptable. Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the responder will successfully perform the required effort, or the responder's performance record is unknown.</p>
<p>Unacceptable. Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the responder will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Neutral. No relevant performance record Is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance rating. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the quoter or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.</p>
<p>Notes: Quoters are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the quoter. The information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.</p>
<p>A quoter who with no relevant past performance record will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably and will receive a neutral rating. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sector. For contractors with no relevant past performance, the government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past experience or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement.</p>

<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.<br /><br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-16-339 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). <br /> <strong><br />NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees. <br /><br /><strong>SET-ASIDE STATUS</strong><br />This acquisition is unrestricted. Businesses of any size classification may respond.<br /><br /><strong>ACQUISITION AUTHORITY&nbsp;</strong>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and IS NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. <br /> <br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-87-2, dated April 6, 2016. The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />A major part of the research activities within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Division of Intramural Research (DIR) focuses on clinical nuerocardiology. The Clinical Neurocardiology Section (CNCS) studies biomarkers, mechanisms, and potential treatment of catecholamine depletion in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Approved, active clinical research protocols of the CNCS all require autonomic function testing. For instance, CNCS's study on biomarkers of risk of PD focuses on whether people who have statistical risk factors for PD have objective evidence-"biomarkers"-that the disease process is actually going on and if so whether people who have abnormal "biomarkers" actually develop PD during several years of follow-up. <br /><br />One of the key types of biomarkers under study is the sympathetic noradrenergic component of the autonomic nervous system, which is assessed physiologically by monitoring beat-to-beat blood pressure non-invasively by an automated finger cuff device. CNCS requires a finger cuff blood pressure recording system to replace the existing system.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The purpose of this requirement is acquisition of one (1) finger cuff blood pressure recording system that will be used to continuously monitor and non-invasively record blood pressure and related cardiovascular variables for clinical research study patients.<br /><strong><br />Project Requirements</strong></p>

<DESC>The Engineering Enclave for Maritime Security (EEMS) will provide the Navy with something unavailable anywhere else, insight into the control systems that make global trade possible.  One of the largest economic movements of the last century was globalization, which is entirely dependent on the safe navigation of enormous vessels as they traverse the worlds oceans delivering goods.  In turn, these vessels are critically dependent on computer aided systems that keep them in communication with the shore, chart their course around the globe, and control their engineering systems.  A map of the cyber terrain where global trade could be the most vulnerable.  The Naval Postgraduate School intends to utilize EEMS to build an engineering enclave to study the architectures, components, protocols, firmware, and processors that underpin global trade.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Up to two firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $15,000,000.00. To be considered a Small Business under this NAICS Code, the respondent's average revenue for the last three fiscal years cannot be more than $15,000,000.00. Up to two contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated. These contracts will be for a period of performance of up to five (5) years, consisting of a base contract period of three (3) years and an option to extend the contract term by an additional two (2) years. This MATOC will have a combined capacity of $10,000,000.00. The full $10,000,000.00 will be available for the base year and any remaining funds will carry over once the option year is exercised. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.1) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employee's office location (not the location of the work). To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Task orders under this contract may include A-E services that provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. <br /><br />Civil Works project studies and designs could involve levees, floodwalls, dams, spillways, pumping stations, various mechanical gate structures, stilling basins, hydraulic flow control structures, bridges, buildings, infrastructure (road and utility) systems, operations and maintenance manuals, dam safety risk analyses, and flood damage reduction project/system risk based analysis.</p>
<p>Civil Works studies may also include, but not be limited to, the evaluation of flood damage and risk, preparation of engineering analysis, acquisition of geotechnical (explorations), topographic and hydrographic data, material testing results, hydraulic physical modeling results, constructability reviews, economic analysis, environmental documents and environmental restoration to include wetlands development. Input may be required by the full range of disciplines including but not limited to: civil, structural, hydraulic, geotechnical, mechanical and electrical engineering, architectural, landscape architects, hydrology, geology, seismology, surveying, mapping, construction, and cost engineering. Individual task orders may include maintenance and repair type projects and miscellaneous architectural and engineering services associated with Civil Works projects. A smaller emphasis of design services may be for Military Construction and HTRW projects.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for designs and drawings using computer aided design and drafting (CADD). Work may be performed in an AutoCAD, Microstation, or equal, environment.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Up to four firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $15,000,000.00. Up to four contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated. These contracts will be for a period of performance of up to five (5) years, consisting of a base contract period of three (3) years and an option to extend the contract term by an additional two (2) years. This MATOC will have a combined capacity of $35,000,000.00. The full $35,000,000.00 will be available for the base year and any remaining funds will carry over once the option years are exercised. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.1) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employee's office location (not the location of the work). If a large business firm is selected for one of these contracts, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date. A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330. If a large business is selected it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract. Sacramento District's recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 41.5% for small business. The goal further states that of the 40.08% to be subcontracted to small business, 21.69% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.33% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 5.58% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business), 3.0% for veteran-owned small business and 4.97% is for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (subset to small business). If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met. Firms should indicate personnel and subcontracts selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>RE: VA786-16-R-0133

An amendment to the solicitation as follow:

The government reserves the right to move the tree installation portion of this project to mid-September 2016. This is due to the fact that by the time this project may be awarded and the Contractor will secure the 27 trees to be installed; we may be on the back edge of the spring planting season and too close to summer where the trees may be unnecessarily stressed from summer heat. Planting too late in the spring may cause a greater risk of tree failure. Moving the planting to mid-September will provide a greater chance for the trees to become established without the heat of summer.

<p>Affordable Manufacture of Free-Form Prism Eyepiece Optics</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses and is in no way obligated by the information received. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing a future acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. NOTE: The use of RFI Number W909MY-16-R-C016 is for tracking purposes only.</p>
<p>BACKGROUD/DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir (ACC-APG-Belvoir) is conducting Market Research on behalf of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. NVESD is searching for sources of affordable free form prism eyepiece optics.</p>
<p>CERDEC NVESD is seeking to develop affordable manufacturing processes to realize free-form prism eyepiece optics which can be demonstrated in head-mounted display systems. Free-form prism eyepieces have been successfully demonstrated by NVESD under the "High Definition Aviation Digital Display" (HiDADD) program to offer excellent optical performance and user comfort when coupled with a micro-display. NVESD therefore intends to develop a competitive industrial capability to manufacture free-form prism eyepiece optical elements. Details of the free-form optical design techniques may be obtained from the following technical journal article: APPLIED OPTICS, 10 May 2009 / Vol. 48, No. 14, "Design of an optical see-through head-mounted display with a low f-number and large field of view using a freeform prism." This technology requires the fabrication and bonding of two plastic prism halves, with each half possessing multiple free-form surfaces, and with free-form surfaces meeting at a bonded or cemented boundary. Relevant manufacturing technology therefore includes multi-axis single-point diamond turning, plastic molding, hard coating of optical plastics, and integral opto-mechanical design for snap-fit integration and self-alignment.</p>
<p>NVESD is currently seeking sources who can perform the following mandatory manufacturing improvement efforts:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate how a baseline process (i.e., work procedure &amp; traveler) and associated unit production cost can be improved by the efforts developed under this effort.</p>
<p>2. Ensure the production unit cost is less than the targeted military unit price of $750 per monocular eyepiece assembly (This cost does not include the display panel, electronics, or external mounting components).</p>
<p>3. Fulfill a range of projected production rates from 500 units/year up to 10,000 units/year.</p>
<p>NVESD is additionally seeking optical fabrication sources who can perform the following efforts:</p>
<p>1. Develop baseline processes based on final designs and test parameters desired by the system integrators.</p>
<p>2. Evolve the fabrication steps to continually reduce manufacturing costs through a series of three or more batch iterations totaling several hundred finished sample optical elements.</p>
<p>3. Produce free form prism eyepiece samples that will then be transitioned to the display integrators who will integrate the eyepieces into working demonstrator display systems for final quality evaluations.</p>
<p>In the event a solicitation is issued in relation to this requirement, the Government would focus the effort on the manufacturing processes and cost reduction(s). The Government would additionally provide a nominal free form prism optical prescription and performance specification which could then be directly transferred by the contractor into CAD models for mechanical feature development and tool path generation. The Government design may include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Be appropriate for an average military requirement with 25 mm eye relief<br />&bull; Have approximately 40 degree horizontal field of view<br />&bull; Be in full color,<br />&bull; Be roughly an 18.432 mm horizontal format with up to 1900 active pixels.</p>
<p>Data Rights</p>
<p>It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, it is the responsibility of the interested party submitting data to clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. No Classified data shall be provided via email.</p>
<p><br />RESPONDING TO THIS RFI:</p>
<p>Sources able to address the above request are invited to submit information describing their technology and any technology demonstrator, including pictures, if applicable. The submission should also include an analysis of how the demonstrator addresses the performance objectives outlined in the RFI.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to change the Unit of Issue (UOI) from EA (each) to BX (Box). &nbsp;See NSN Description below.<br /><br />This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6210-00-NIB-0006<br />Name:		Tube Light, LED, T8, Universal (Type A or B), 4100K, 2 Foot<br />Description:	LED tube light is designed to replace a 2 foot T8 tube light. The T8 tube light will be compatible with current electronic ballasts "plug &amp; play" (Type A); while also able to be used via bypassing the ballast (Type B). The tube light provide a minimum light output of 1000 lumens, with a color temperature of 4100K Tube is rated to last over 50,000 hours. Tube is non-dimmable, and will work with 120-277 volts. Tube is 2 Feet. UOI is BX. &nbsp;BX = 20.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			6210-00-NIB-0006<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	zT82441123E-X; 452037 (32MX89); 421834 (30Z962); 429829 (46C250); 33L574; LL-T8-2-BC-18W-F-41K; LX-T8-X-24-NW</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than May 4, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<SOLNBR>AG-0343-S-16-0030

<RESPDATE>050216
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This project is being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribe Watershed program. The goal of this partnership is to use restoration techniques to improve waterways. This contract requires data collection and analysis; preparation of design drawings, specifications, cost estimates and supporting documentation; and related work in compliance with its terms, specifications and provisions. This includes the furnishing of all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies and incidentals (except those designated as Government-furnished).<br /><br />The overall objective is to re-design the previously delineated Stream Reach 2 of Upper Newsome Creek to accommodate for the valley-wide restored floodplain and increased budget.&nbsp; New work elements for the Stream Reach 2 design shall be prioritized as follows: <br /><br />1. New Channel and/or new channel meander construction. Woody debris structures and grade control structures associated with new channel meanders will also be added to the design. <br />2. New habitat improvement structures (design similar in nature to what was implemented in stream Reaches 5, 4, and 3).
<p>The design should achieve the following goals while balancing objectives, costs, and benefits.</p>
<p>1) Improve channel morphology &amp; stream function utilizing as much of the restored valley bottom and floodplain as feasible within Stream Reach 2.<br />2) Increase fish habitat within Stream Reach 2 primarily through the use of stream habitat features (pools, riffles, glides, ect.) and large woody debris.</p>
<p>Background: Full restoration of Stream Reaches 5, 4, and 3 was implemented in 2011 - 2014. These completed reaches and floodplain restoration work are to be used as reference for the design for Stream Reach 2. The large woody debris "system" used on previous reaches should be referenced and carried through Reach 2.</p>
<p>In 2014 and 2015, dredge piles were removed from the Reach 2 floodplain to re-establish the floodplain elevation. The dredge material was placed in repositories at the toe of the hillslopes. In addition, topsoil was salvaged and placed in stockpiles. However, the Newsome Creek through Reach 2 is still in its impacted, straightened channel and lacks structure for fish habitat. <br /><br />Location: The project is approximately 38 mi east of Grangeville, Idaho.

<p>********************************************************<br />This is a pre-solicitation notice for Architect-Engineering Services. The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contract for the work described in this notice. The Government intends to set this requirement aside 100% for small business.<br />The NAICS for this requirement is 541320 Landscape Architectural Services with a small business size standard of $7.5M. FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting will be included in the resulting contract. This clause includes a requirement that for service contracts (except construction) at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern (prime contractor).<br />This preliminary notice is being posted to allow prospective offerors time to read through the requirement, start building their consulting team and submit early questions regarding the work outlined in this notice. This notice will be updated in the next few (2-3) weeks with a more detailed requirement including evaluation criteria, submission requirements and a due date for submission.</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND<br />The Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area (MGRA) is located approximately twelve miles from downtown Juneau at the head of the Mendenhall Valley, the area of most rapid urban development in the City and Borough of Juneau. Use patterns within the Recreation Area are influenced by Juneau residents and out-of-town visitors.<br />The Recreation Area encompasses 5,815 acres and includes parts of McGinnis Mountain and Mt. Bullard, the terminus of the Mendenhall Glacier, Mendenhall Lake and River, and the surrounding uplands. Elevations through much of the Recreation Area are less than 100 feet above sea level. On either side, mountains rise abruptly to over 4,000 feet. From its source twelve miles up in the Juneau Icefield, the Mendenhall Glacier flows between Bullard Mountain and McGinnis Mountain to Mendenhall Lake. <br />DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF WORK.<br />The Alaska Region of USDA Forest Service is seeking qualified contractors to deliver two items: (1) a Conceptual Development Plan for the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area (MGRA) and (2) a detailed Master Plan for the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center Unit (MGVC) of MGRA. To complete the MGVC Master Plan the contractor will need to prepare an Environmental Assessment between the preliminary version and final version MGVC Master Plan. The final MGVC Master Plan will reflect changes brought forth during the Environmental Assessment.<br />The MGRA Conceptual Development Plan will guide the development of recreation infrastructure in the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area accommodating the anticipated visitation needs over the next 20 years with a goal of addressing all anticipated demand, while providing a vision for the next 50 years. The geographic scope of this effort will include the entire MGRA and accommodate all that want to visit the site by dispersing use throughout the MGRA. Trails and wildlife viewing are important activities to be incorporated into the Conceptual Development Plan. The plan will include both text and graphic depictions of the site to guide future facility developments that help achieve multiple purposes.<br />A conceptual development plan, as used here, is general in nature and shows by schematic diagram the relationships between various land uses and forms of circulation within the site. It illustrates the relationships between proposed development(s) and existing and proposed site conditions. Typically a site analysis is completed as part of this work based on available information for topography, vegetation, soils, hydrology, existing infrastructure, etc. The plan shall include, as a minimum, proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns and location of parking areas, service areas, building locations, and other appurtenances considered in the overall design. Site development capacity (e.g, persons at one time, number of cars) should be included, and illustrative cross-sections through specific areas are desirable in providing the intent of the site design commensurate with large area development plans.<br />The second major work product is a site-specific master plan for the MGVC unit. Master planning will balance opportunities and constraints of the current site, the needs of the site to serve the public and to protect resources, and to fulfill management objectives such as transportation efficiency and sustainability, accessibility, energy conservation, improved visitor experiences, and resource protection. The master plan will identify how to best serve the immediate needs at the site. In addition there will be a series of conceptual designs depicting site specific improvements, which will likely require additional topographic surveys.<br />There will be a need for public charrettes to inform the public and gather information and critiques of the work completed for both components of the project; many of these meetings will be able to serve both projects. It is anticipated that much of the information gathered and generated in the Conceptual Development Plan will assist in refining the MGVC Master Plan. There will also be public meetings that will conform to the requirements specified for NEPA analysis of the conceptual designs completed for the MGVC Master Plan. It is anticipated there will a total of between six and eight public meetings/charrettes.<br />Any designs shall incorporate current accessibility standards: Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS); the Forest Service Outdoor Recreation Accessibility Guidelines (FSORAG) and The Forest Service Trails Accessibility Guidelines (FSTAG). <br />The Government is relying upon the Contractor to provide complete planning and design services in the performance of this work. We envision the team will bring innovative ideas based on research of other locations that will challenge our existing perceptions and ideas, and excel at involving the public and constituents in an engaging, positive process to harness the ideas and connection of the people to the area. It is anticipated that the team will consist of the following disciplines: Landscape Architects, Landscape Planners, Civil Engineers, NEPA Specialists, Public Involvement Specialists and Subject Matter Experts in some or all of the following topics: climate change, economics, ecology, glaciology, natural resource interpretation, renewable energy, sustainable tourism, visitor and recreation trends, terrestrial and aquatic biology, transit systems for parks, sustainable building design.<br />SCHEDULE<br />The Forest Service anticipates awarding four total task orders for this work. The period of performance for this requirement (all task orders) is anticipated to be two years from date of award.</p>

<p>The web-based SpaceNav conjunction assessment suite of this procurement enhances Engineering ability to conduct conjunction analysis in several ways: (1) Suitability for analysis of Low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) spacecraft events - in contrast, SDA services are more favorable for geostationary satellites; (2) Numerous graphical tools for analysis visualization; (3) Realistic covariance determination allows for greater resolution of risk assessment by providing probabilities of events based on positional uncertainties; (4) Recommendations for design of collision-avoidance maneuvers. Given the growing numbers of geostationary, low-earth orbiting satellites and space debris, the enhanced capabilities realized by subscription to SpaceNav services is considered an effective return on investment in protection of this critical meteorological infrastructure.</p>
<p>The DOC/NOAA/NESDIS is not aware of other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award for a one-year subscription to the web-based suite of conjunction analysis tools provided by SpaceNav.</p>

Reports will be delivered either through email with attachments, or through download to the client workstation.<br />&bull;	Two service training sessions provided by SpaceNav staff; one provided at contract award, and a second near midyear of the performance period</p>
<p>The subscription will apply to the NOAA satellites listed below,<br />&bull;	S-NPP<br />&bull;	NOAA 15<br />&bull;	NOAA 18<br />&bull;	NOAA19<br />&bull;	GOES 13<br />&bull;	GOES 14<br />&bull;	GOES 15</p>

<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD). NSWCCD has a requirement to procure portable machinery vibration analyzers. It is the Government's intention to procure these analyzers utilizing other than full and open competition, from Crystal Instruments in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; Only Crystal Instruments' CoCo-80 and CoCo-90 portable machinery vibration analyzers meet the Government's requirements without substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The Navy's Submarine Vibration Monitoring Program (VMP) is directly responsible for monitoring vibrations from all rotating equipment onboard every submarine in the Atlantic and Pacific Fleet on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; Machines are monitored in an effort to ensure against catastrophic failure of critical ship equipment and unnecessary maintenance of machinery, maximizing operating time and ensuring mission completion.&nbsp; NSWCCD uses the CoCo-80 to convert and process time domain signals from accelerometers mounted on submarine machinery and hydrophone sensors into numerical and spectral data that can be analyzed by NSWCCD personnel.&nbsp; NSWCCD currently uses Crystal Instruments' CoCo-80 to perform these functions on acoustic trials, but needs to expand this capability to provide machinery and structure borne noise analysis for all submarines in the fleet.&nbsp; NSWCCD competitively procured its current Crystal Instruments' CoCo-80 system under Contract N00167-11-D-0010. The previous procurement was a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NSWCCD owns and maintains legacy expert system software that is external to the CoCo-80 system.&nbsp; This software is used to process vibration data and generate messages that are issued to the fleet.&nbsp; It has taken the Government over three years to create an Application Program Interface (API) that will allow the data collected from the CoCo-80 to be loaded into the NSWCCD expert system software. Therefore, only the CoCo-80 and CoCo-90 will permit continued operation of the existing data acquisition and analysis while expanding capability to acquire submarine structure borne data without substantial duplication of Government effort to develop a new API compatible with the legacy expert system software.&nbsp; This duplication of effort is conservatively estimated to result in $1M of research and labor costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cost is based on three man years' worth of NSWCCD labor that was funded to create and test the API to allow data to be transferred between the CoCo-80 and the NSWCCD expert system software.&nbsp; In addition, a different hardware solution would require a full accreditation process to be completed in order to be deployed on submarines, resulting in additional cost and scheduling impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSWCCD intends to issue a solicitation to Crystal Instruments to meet mission requirements.&nbsp; Prior to issuing a sole source solicitation, NSWCCD is requesting information in order to make an informed determination regarding procurement strategy. A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES</span>:</strong> Responses shall include specific details regarding the ability to provide the required portable machinery vibration analyzers to meet the Government's need. Responses shall discuss how product(s) will meet the requirements found in the SOW.</p>
<p>Responses are not to exceed ten (10) pages in length. A cover page for the response shall be included. The cover page, at a minimum, shall include the company name, address, points of contact (name(s), e-mail address(es), and telephone number(s)), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and business size status for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334515.&nbsp; The cover page is not considered in the total page count.</p>
<p>NSWCCD will accept only electronic unclassified submission of responses. Responses shall be sent to Christine Dye via e-mail at christine.dye@navy.mil.&nbsp; All responses shall be submitted no later than 1700 hours on 11 May 2016.</p>
<p>This RFI is for market research purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for&nbsp;Quotation (RFQ). This notice shall not be construed as a contract, a promise to contract, or as a commitment of any kind by the Government. This RFI is issued solely for conducting market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and gathering information for planning purposes.</p>
<p>The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI, and the Government will not compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the response to this RFI. The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<p>8. What is your company's depth of technical expertise/experience with application development involving support that includes identity verification or identify matching? We want to understand the broad range of your capabilities in this area. Have you performed these services previously? If so, for whom?<br /><br />9. The majority of TSA's current environment use the applications/tools identified on page C-17 of the Draft SOO. Specifically, what is your company's experience in providing support to support legacy system application development while moving forward to agile and other newer applications? What is your company's experience in software development using the applications/tools identified? <br /><br />10. What is your company's depth of expertise in providing skilled personnel who are able to develop software to support our current application environment, as well as any other applications/tools that are not in the current environment? How will your company be able to support development cycles in a dynamic environment with changing priorities? What is your experience in doing this in an "agile" environment? <br /><br />11. What is your company's experience in working in environments that contain classified information, PII or other sensitive information?<br /><br />12. What is your company's experience in working in an agile environment? What is your company's experience in helping transition government agencies from traditional application development environments to other forms of application development?<br /><br />13. TSA is looking to transition to an "agile" development environment in the near future. Currently, TSA uses a waterfall methodology as its application development process. How would your company manage for success given this potential operational constraint?<br /><br />14. TSA would like to shorten its transition and knowledge transfer time to better position it to be successful. What has been your experience working in an environment with this perceived operational challenge? How did you handle providing knowledgeable cleared personnel in an agile environment? How would you respond to this operational problem/constraint?</p>
