A firm fixed price contract valued at approximately$4,500,000 is planned to be awarded to Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) on or before 15 February 2013. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) faces a myriad of nationwide threats requiring specially trained Special Operations Forces (SOFs) to conduct counter terrorism (CT) and counter narcotics (CN) missions. Coalition Forces currently perform all Fixed Wing (FW) SOF missions within the Afghanistan Theater of Operations. In order to facilitate and accelerate the continued transfer of security responsibilities to the GIRoA and Afghanistan SOF, ANASOF required a FW multi-mission platform. The required timeline for delivery of these training devices to the SMW is June 2013. A February 2013 award date is required as the training devices take approximately six months to procure due to the development and integration of the specialized Afghan software. This effort is an exceptional circumstance not only due to the need outlined by the Air Force Special Security Assistance Command but because it fulfills a requirement to grow the SMW and stand up an autonomous SOF capability. SNC is the contractor purchasing and modifying these multi-use aircraft along with developing a high performance suite of software required to aggregate and display mission essential data in a common operating picture. They are the only source available to contract with that possesses the knowledge to fulfill the training requirements within the timeline required for the build of the trainers concurrently with the modified aircraft.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 11/09/12. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are: Sensata Technologies (55YR1) and US Army Armament (59678). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975 to procure the following:</p>
<p>1. HiSeq 2000 System, Catalog Number: SY-401-1001, Quantity: One (1). <br />2. Trade-In for GAiiX Sequencer, Serial Number: 300748, Quantity: One (1).<br />3. Shipping and Insurance Charge.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. NISC has served the NIH community for over 15 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for services. NISC currently has three HiSeq2000 sequencers in full operation and an additional sequencer is needed to meet the sequencing demand. Over the past 2.5 years NISC has invested significant resources to develop a state of the art data analysis pipeline based on the Illumina family of sequencers.</p>
<p>The instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run. This sequencing technology also provides an easy-to-use protocol that does not require emulsion PCR which allows for a self-contained system that minimizes handling errors and contamination concerns, eliminating the need for robotics or clean rooms. The HiSeq2000 System provides ultra-high output and speed. In a single run one is able to sequence more than 5 human genomes at ~30x coverage. It is able to process a diverse set of samples within one flow cell, and with the highest data quality currently available. Another key factor in this selection is that this instrument is upgradable to a new version of sequencer that will allow NISC to decrease the turnaround time by many weeks. This is a critical consideration for projects impacting patient diagnosis. Illumina is the sole manufacturer of the HiSeq2000 System. The parts are unique to these instruments and cannot be substituted by other vendor parts.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1(b), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-62 (December 20, 2012).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from NIH/NHLBI, contractors must be registered and have a valid CCR and ORCA on-line at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you have any questions, please submit to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to award a modification on a sole source basis to Booz Allen Hamilton, Incorporated, 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, Virginia, 22102-4904 for 16,450 hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel, Material, and NMCI under contract N00421-12-C-0001 for the continuance of technical and engineering services to support co ntinued design, enginnering, acquisitio, integration, installation, training, operational support, and in-service engineering for Combat identification, Air Traffic Control, and Electronic Countermeasures systems while the follow-on is being completed. This modification covers an extended period of performance of approximately three months with a one month option for transition if required. This modification is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling on 31 January 2013. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-12-C-0001 and the need to continue these services without a break in work; Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services until award of the competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 18 January 2013, 1630 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Maria Mattei-Chaney, Code 2.5.4.3 via email (maria.mattei-chaney@navy.mil). <br /><br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy ageny requirements.' These services include requirements to support the Fleet with the ability to positively identify and track cooperative and non-cooperative targets in both combat and air traffic control environments for the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and other customers. Services are currently being performed by Booz Allen Hamilton under contract N00421-12-C-0001. As a result of sponsor requirements, all options and all available ceiling are projected to be expended by 31 January 2013. Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating an inpact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government woul d incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a contract modification to contract N61331-12-C-0007 with CTC Enterprise Ventures Corporation (EVC), a wholly-owned corporation of Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1535, for the procurement of ten (10) additional production AN/ALQ-223 Sensor Deployment Systems (CSTRS) kits.    This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons.  CTC is the designer, developer, and original fabricator of the CSTRS system. EVC is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTC.  EVC is currently supporting and has previously supported CTCs contracts through inter-divisional transfers for past CSTRS efforts and other contracts as appropriate.
  This is acquisition of production units of a major system of highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Given the complexity of the CSTRS System and the level of system knowledge required to provide production support of the CSTRS system, EVC, through its interdivisional transfers with CTC, is the only source possessing the requisite expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering, production, and quality of service to accomplish all tasking.   

The NAICS code is 336413 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.
  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.  

In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM.

EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at https://www.fbo.gov.
  Vendors should regularly access this web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Aviation Technologies Inc. (Avitech) for the procurement of two (2) each AV843-9 Hydraulic Component Test Stand (HCTS) kits with the associated data that will be used to modify the AV843 units and options for onsite training and onsite support, at the Royal Air Force Mildenhall in Suffolk, England for the CV-22 Aircraft. The AV843 HCTS is used for testing aircraft hydraulic components on the CV-22. The current test stand does not meet all of the functional test capabilities that are required for off-aircraft hydraulic component testing and therefore a modification kit is necessary.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. Avitech is the designer, developer and manufacture of the HCTS and therefore, is the only manufacture that can design the unique modification kits necessary for the Avitech AV843-9 units. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this synopsis in writing within fifteen (15) days of this posting, which may be used by the government to determine whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The point of contact is Ms. Rene Brown, rene.brown@navy.mil.</p>

The Panel shall establish a short-list of qualified firms. The short-listed Lead Designers and their associated A/E Firms will be notified in writing and requested to submit more detailed information for evaluation in Stage 2.</p>
<p>For Stage 2, the short-list of offerors will assemble their technical teams and submit detailed information as to their proposed team, management plan, and past performance on construction documents. Sufficient time will be provided for the Lead Designer(s) and their associated A/E Firms to establish their team.

<p>The government will provide detailed evaluation criteria for the Stage 2 submission and the interview at the time the short-listed firms from Stage 1 are notified. Stage 2 submissions will be reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel. The Technical Evaluation Panel will not re-score the Stage 1 submissions, but will make a determination of the most highly qualified team consistent with the announced evaluation criteria for Stage 2 and will recommend that offeror for award to the OBO Director.</p>
<p>This is neither a request for proposal, nor a design competition. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541310, $7 million average.<br />This selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104) and FAR Part 36. After the successful offeror(s) has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations concerning level of effort and price.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful offeror must possess, or be eligible to obtain, a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DOS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Additionally, the successful offeror selected for contract award must possess, or immediately obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS-approved classified IS for processing classified information. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Stage 2 submissions.</p>
<p>If an uncleared offeror from the Stage 2 short-list is recommended to the Director for selection, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL. Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements. Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.<br />Until the selected firm has been issued at least an Interim Secret FCL, and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents, they will not receive the classified portions of the RFP requirements package. A period of 90 calendar days, from the date of sponsorship, will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain a Secret FCL. If the firm has not obtained the FCL after 90 days, the Government may terminate negotiations with the offeror, and may move to select another short-listed firm for award.</p>
<p>Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Certain design team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances.

<DESC>I. TITLE: Services de Sant&eacute; de Qualit&eacute; pour Ha&iuml;ti (SSQH)
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the three-year (with the option of a two-year extension) Services de Sant&eacute; de Qualit&eacute; pour Ha&iuml;ti (SSQH) project is to improve the health status of the Haitian population. This will be achieved by: (1) increasing utilization of the Minist&egrave;re de la Sant&eacute; Publique et de la Population's (MSPP) integrated package of services at the primary care and community levels (particularly in rural or isolated areas); (2) improving the functionality of the USG-supported health referral networks; (3) facilitating sustainable delivery of quality health services through the institutionalization of key management practices at both the facility and community levels; and (4) strengthening departmental health authorities' capacity to manage and monitor service delivery.</p>
<p>III. ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF FUNDING</p>
<p>Subject to the availability of funds, USAID intends to provide up to approximately $70,000,000 to be allocated over a 3-year period, with the option to extend contracts by two years. USAID anticipates awarding three contracts to implement this project, but reserves the right to make between one and three contracts.</p>
<p>IV. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The project will support the direct delivery of clinical and community-based services for people living in geographic areas currently supported by the USAID-funded Sant&eacute; pour le D&eacute;veloppement et la Stabilit&eacute; d'Ha&iuml;ti (SDSH) project. Support to geographic areas will be achieved through the delivery of a "package" of primary healthcare services, defined within the MSPP Essential Package of Services, and will include support for: 1) HIV/AIDS; 2) Tuberculosis (TB); 3) Maternal and Child Health (MCH) (including Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Nutrition); and 4) Family Planning (FP).</p>
<p>As this project will respond to principles defined within the GOH/USG 2011 Partnership Framework,which promotes ownership and oversight of health services by the GOH (as well as reduced dependence on donor support over time), a central component of this project will be the requirement to make use of, and strengthen, host country systems (i.e. regulatory, monitoring and evaluation, human resources, procurement, and financial). In addition to supporting the provision of services, this project will place emphasis on site-level governance and accountability through structured mentorship and targeted assistance. A key mandate within the contracts for this project will be to collaborate with departmental health authorities and Unit&eacute;s d'Arrondissement de Sant&eacute; (UAS - District Health Unit) as well as other USG-supported implementing partners to support prescribed referral networks defined within each award</p>
<p>Full RFP will be posted within 15 days</p>

<DESC>The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System is a worldwide, network centric system of fixed and deployable, scalable and modular ground station components that provide multi-source intelligence data to the warfighter. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing, and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS is part of the overall DoD DCGS architecture and consists of core locations, remote sites, and a robust dissemination system. The Communications Modernization solution will be used to replace the current legacy ATM network throughout the AF DCGS enterprise. The current legacy ATM network successfully transports serial sensor bitstreams, non-serial imaging sensors bitstreams (both stills and full motion video), and imagery (full and motion), voice, avionics bitstreams, and data as received from reconnaissance aircraft aloft overseas to various AF DCGS sites, where processing takes place. Following successful processing, products are commonly sent over IP networks to consumers. The IP networks used to transport products to consumers is not being replaced.
<p>The goal is to allow the AF DCGS enterprise to take advantage of emerging high-speed deterministic technologies to meet the requirements of moving very large amounts non-processed bitstreams in real-time, with extremely low bit error rates, and with deterministic (fixed latency, precision-timed -latency) capabilities using a converged network topology.</p>

<DESC>The US Air Force Defense Support Program (DSP) intends to issue a follow-on contract to the current DSP On-orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation. The new contract, DSP Sustainment Contract (DSC) is currently envisioned by the government to be awarded as a single contract. It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released in the 2nd quarter of FY13 with a period of performance beginning in FY 14 with one basic year and four (4) one-year options. Contract award is projected for the 4th quarter of FY13. The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes. The DSC will require the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Spaced based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facilities supporting on-orbit operations (either from the factory or at the ops site) must be Defense Security Service (DSS) certified and capable of processing classified information as required by the DSP constellation. The contractor retains responsibility for recapitalization and/or replacement of any hardware/equipment obsolescence throughout the duration of the contract; (5) Program support includes management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites. In addition, the government may seek to continue efforts currently on the DOSSC as follows: (1) rapid prototyping of data processing enhancements that maximize the utility of DSP data and maintain mission capability of aging assets; and (2) mission processor initiatives. Interested parties must possess knowledgeable, capable, and experienced individuals with the proper security clearances who can provide real time assistance/guidance to government satellite operators at the Mission Control Station and any backup site supporting operations.

<a href="mailto:brian.g.huffman3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE), Personnel Parachutes Team, Fort Belvoir, VA, is conducting a market survey to locate potential manufacturers or suppliers of a handheld navigation device (nav) in support of the Parachute Navigation System (PARANAVSYS).  The PARANAVSYS program is in response to a need identified by the US Army (USA) Special Operations Command (USASOC) for a Global Positioning System (GPS) based navigation device for use during clandestine air infiltration missions.  A capability gap exists in the tools available to the USA Airborne and Special Operations Forces (SOF) communities for planning and conducting High Altitude-High Opening (HAHO) and High Altitude-Low Opening (HALO) MFF missions.  Currently units must rely on map studies, simple magnetic compasses which are susceptible to error due to crabbing (the difference between straight compass heading and actual track from outside influence such as winds) or commercial GPS devices not designed for the MFF mission.  The PARANAVSYS will provide a reliable and easy to use handheld navigation device that will allow for accurate, automated mission planning, precise determination of the release point (RP) in the aircraft, the ability to update the mission profile as required prior to deployment, and real time navigation information during infiltration to multiple drop zones (DZs).  The system will allow for enhanced mission capabilities due to the elimination of environmental and visual limitations of the current doctrine.  It will increase the operational capability of Commanders to infiltrate parachutists by air surreptitiously into enemy held or denied territory, maintaining unit integrity and maximizing Force Protection at multiple IPs with near simultaneous landings, during all weather and light conditions. <br>  <br> Handheld Navigation Device.  The nav is a handheld mobile hardware (HW) platform which runs navigation, jumpmaster (JM) and mission planning (MP) SW, and provides visual instruction to the user.  The nav shall be a commercial-based, integrated computing platform with display and data entry suitable for Airborne use.  It shall acquire and process GPS data, which the navigation SW will use to display mission critical information to the parachutist, communicate via a data link (both wireless and hardwired) to a separate MP laptop computer and have the ability to connect with IP based radio systems to provide jumper and cargo asset position location information and other situational awareness (SA) information.  The nav must also support MP SW and be able to send updated mission files/data to other navs.  Although durability is a major concern, the nav should be as small and light as possible to reduce the burden placed on the parachutist by additional weight and reduced space for securing other equipment, while still allowing for a user-friendly, intuitive system design.  The use of COTS smartphones and/or tablets is encouraged to reduce system cost, and increase the maintainability and availability of replacement parts.  The display should be readily accessible and require minimal time and effort to activate once under canopy.   To be effective, the nav must be operational during all phases and usable in all weather and environmental conditions of the MFF mission to include extreme temperatures, high altitude and high g shock during canopy opening; it must be operable with all extreme temperature gear such as face shields, goggles, gloves, etc.  <br>  <br> REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> The nav should meet the following performance requirements, which contain both Threshold [T] and Objective [O] levels.  The objective level is the performance goal, while the threshold level is the minimum acceptable performance short of the goal. <br>  <br> 1) Environmental. <br>  <br> a) Operate at an altitude of up to 24,999 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) [T]; up to 35,000 feet MSL [O]. <br>  <br> b) Operate at a steady temperature of 40?F with a sudden drop to -30?F.

<SUBJECT>59--Deep Buried Detection Capability for the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS)
<SOLNBR>W909MY-13-R-D007
<RESPDATE>020413
<ARCHDATE>03042013
<CONTACT>Alison Landin, 7037040157

<a href="mailto:alison.landin@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Washington</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager for Countermine and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (PM-CM&EOD) is seeking a qualified source to provide a Deep Buried Detection (DBD) capability for the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) acquisition program.  The Army requires this capability to support Army route clearance and area detection operations by detecting surface laid and buried explosive threats, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with pressure activated trigger mechanisms, unexploded ordnance (UXO), landmines, and weapons caches.  <br>   <br> The DBD capability is required to detect deep buried metallic Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and metallic encased caches.  The probability of detection is required to be not less than 85% of metallic IEDs and not less than 85% of metallic encased caches buried down to 48 inches (1.2 meters) of soil overburden.  The False Alarm Rate is required to be 10 or fewer false alarms per linear kilometer of road scanned and 10 or fewer false alarms per 3,500 square meters of area scanned for cache detection.  <br>  <br> The DBD capability is required to be installed on the front of the Husky vehicle, and be radio-frequency (RF) interoperable/compatible with the HMDS Program of Record ground penetrating radar (GPR), which is anticipated to be the NIITEK GEN II Enhanced HMDS currently fielded to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The DBD capability is required to scan a path width of at least 3.2 meters.  While seated inside the Husky, the operator must be able to raise and lower the DBD sensor to avoid impacting the road surface, to configure the DBD sensor for fording, and to move the DBD sensor to a secure position on the Husky for rapid administrative movement.  The DBD capability is also required to be interoperable with Blue force electronic warfare devices, and should not degrade the performance of the GPR. The DBD and GPR capabilities are not required to operate simultaneously, but simultaneous operation and fused detection capability (which minimizes operator workload) is desirable.  Future efforts may include the remote operation of the DBD capability on the Husky.   <br>  <br> Please note this is NOT a Request for Proposal.  Offerors shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. Interested Offerors are requested to submit a White Paper that describes the Offeror's specific technologies and devices which meet the required capabilities described above. Offerors should detail their previous knowledge and experience demonstrating the performance of an integrated DBD and GPR in their white papers.  The White Papers should also discuss the Offeror's development and production capabilities.  Details and unclassified results of detection testing conducted to date, to include detection performance tradeoffs of DBD and GPR performance within proximity of each other, environmental testing, etc, should be included.  Company experience, personnel, facilities (R&D and production), and other relevant capabilities should also be identified.  The White Paper shall be no more than 15 pages and be prepared in Microsoft Word, Times New Roman font, size 12.  <br>  <br> Responses should also include a cover letter (not included in the page count) providing: <br> 1.  A point of contact for your Company which will include: the contact's name, address, website (if available), phone number, and email address.  In addition, please provide a Cage Code and Duns Number.  <br> 2.  Is your company currently providing similar products to another government agency or other non-government customer?  If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer.  If you are unwilling to share your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or similar products commercially (outside the federal Government.) <br> a.  If you elect to identify your past and current customers to which you provided similar products, include the customers/company name and point of contact, phone number and address/e-mail where they can be contacted. <br> 3.  Please identify your company's small business size standard based on the applicable NAICS code of 334511.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is 750 employees.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT for a SUBMARINE EMERGENCY POSITION INDICATING RADIO BEACON (SEPIRB) DESIGN AND CERTIFICATION UPGRADE, BY REPLACING OBSOLETE COMPONENTS.  

PURPOSE:  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
 
This is a sources sought notice for written information, and is not a formal solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) PMS394 seeks information to determine interest from qualified commercial sources, with specific technical experience and expertise, and necessary facilities to provide an updated T-1630/SRT Submarine EPIRB (SEPIRB) design and certification, by replacing obsolete components.
  The Contractor will be required to maximize the use of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS)/NDI components, identify their functionality, and provide copies of license agreements related to use of these components to the Government.

BACKGROUND:  The T-1630/SRT SEPIRB currently in use by the U.S. Navy is no longer supportable due to component obsolescence.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW) contains mandatory system requirements; any respondent that does not have the technical capability and facilities to support the upgrade of SEPIRB design and certification requirements may not be considered a potential source.

This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen HC-144A aircraft each powered by two CT7-9C3 turboprop engines. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain, the CT7-9C3 turboprop engines are manufactured by General Electric, Aviation Division based out of Lynn, MA, USA. The model 14RF-37 Propeller assemblies are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand based out of Windsor locks CT, USA. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft and its CT7-9C3 turboprop engines, are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br />USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To establish a Five year, firm-fixed price contract to purchase aircraft parts (see listing).Only the exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. This requirement must be restricted to authorized sources of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide the components and obtain the proprietary data required meeting form, fit, and function of the units. The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.These requirements are necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions.<br /><br />REPLIES:</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 336413- Aircraft assemblies, subassemblies, and parts (except engines) manufacturing. Please respond to the following questions (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published on FedBizOpps. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>Contract No.: GS-35F-0668S
Task Order No. R13PD80108
TAS: 14 4524
(FAR 8.405-6(b)(1))- Authorizes the use of brand name specifications if the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government's requirements.
The Vocus public relations media software has been chosen by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) because based on the market research and responses to the sources sought announcment Vocus' software is specialized as it is the only software that provides a separate area for media and non-media contacts.  It is also the only vendor that can meet Reclamation's needs in providing federal and state elected legislative government officials contact information, as well as their staff.  Other public relations media software combines the media and non-media contacts and requires the procuring agency to provide the contact information.  The Vocus public relations media software also has the ability to directly upload news releases to PRWEB while Reclamation is distributing through the application.  The Vocus public relations media software also interfaces with Critical Mention.  This is very important because Reclamation currently has a contract with Critical Mention to monitor all news anchors, syndicated shows, journalists and consumers to identify when Reclamation is mentioned in the content of any of these vehicles.  

The Limited Sources Justification will also be available for review at:

<CONTACT>Betty B Vannoy, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2891, Fax 770-488-2868, Email bbv9@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc., Atlanta, GA 30312, for the professional services for the participation in the project entitled, "King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest Forum."
<p>CDC intends to negotiate this requirement under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i). The sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13 procedures. The anticipated period of performance will be six months from the award date. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 813410 with a small business size standard of $7 million. The purpose of this contract is to procure the services and technical expertise from the only qualified contractor who will&nbsp;develop and implement a series of coordinated activities focused on the promotion of public health in support of the King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest Initiative as part of the activities for King Week 2013. The Health and Wellness Fest will be held on January 12, 2013, to coincide with the month of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birth, and will take place in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The King Center is the only responsible source capable of providing the King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a civil rights leader, recognized proponent of non-violence, and community outreach leader. The King Center was founded to carry on Dr. King's legacy and share his teachings. The King Center holds the intellectual property rights to proprietary "Kingian" youth non-violence training. Since the Health Fest will focus on the teachings and personal philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., this proprietary training is essential. No other organization can tie the philosophy of non-violence as exemplified by the life of Dr. King, to the issues of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals as effectively as the King Center.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. King's Civil Rights' legacy gives the King Center unparalleled influence in the Atlanta community, the site of the Health and Wellness Fest forum. Dr. King's Civil Rights' work provides the King Center with particularly strong ties to Atlanta's minority community, many of whom stand to benefit from the Health and Wellness Fest Forum. The King's Center's unparalleled influence in the Atlanta Area will allow the message of the Health and Wellness Fest to have a greater impact on the community than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to The King Center. However, firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by January 8, 2013, at 1 PM EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Betty Vannoy by email at bbv9@cdc.gov and reference Solicitation No. BBVFY130002. No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service plans to award a fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart  6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This acquisition is required to support the Julia Butler Hansen Refuge, Cathlamet, Washington. Wildlife tracking collars and Iridium GPS location collars will be used to mark individual Columbia White-tailed deer population.  The selected collars must be within precise weight and size specifications.  Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS) is the manufacture that can meet collaring specifications. GPS collar specifications require less than 900 grams each for placement on the deer. ATS system information can be retrieved remotely and is the most convenient retrieval system available.  The GPS locations are automatically emailed every three weeks, which ensures retrieval of the data, whether or not you're available to receive it. Other systems require you to log on at predetermined intervals to download data. Advanced Telemetry Systems have a long-standing and proven track record of reliability and animal safety.  Of three manufactures contacted, Advanced Telemetry is the most cost-effective; offering equipment within the total acceptable weight; and provides all equipment with the required specifications.  No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a response no later than January 14, 2013, 1500 hrs PDT to be considered.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Linda Askew, via email at linda_askew@fws.gov .

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 AND FAR SUBPART 5.705.
<p>Contract Number SB1341-11-CN-0011 was awarded to Wiklund Research and Design of Concord, MA, on February 28, 2011, in the amount of $1,206,648.00. All work was required to be completed not later than December 31, 2012.</p>
<p>Work required under this contract shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to develop Usability Guidelines and an Evaluation Framework for Electronic Health Records Systems.</p>
<p>The above referenced work is being completed under a time and materials contract. Due to multiple unknowns associated with the project, a firm fixed price could not be established with any reasonable degree of confidence. Unknowns include: uncertainty regarding the frequency and location of meetings that the Contractor will require to complete the required work; uncertainty with respect to the number of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs) available and being utilized in the professional marketplace; and use of a firm fixed price contract was anticipated to limit competition and increase the cost to the Government due to a significant amount of risk.</p>
<p>Modification 003 is being issued to extend the period of performance and completion dates for outstanding deliverables. The extension is required due to Government delays associated with Institutional Review Board and Paperwork Reduction Act approvals required prior to the start of the research protocols. The period of performance has been extended through December 31, 2013. Due dates for deliverables are being modified accordingly.</p>
<p>The total amount of the contract remains unchanged.</p>

The agencys requirement is to purchase furniture for the NCIS Office located at 27130 Telegraph Rd, Quantico, VA 22134-2253.

OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS INTERNATIONAL, INC (OEII)/ALLSTEEL Team Products have been identified through extensive research previously conducted by FENTREE Architect and Hansel Phelps and has been approved by NAVFAC for the use by the 5 agencies occupying the Russell-Knox Building (RKB).
 

The OEII/ALLSTEEL TEAM WAS THE ORGINAL Design Build team responsible for meeting the current operational specifications for systems furniture required by the 5 collocated agencies in RKB.  OEII/ALLSTEEL manufactured systems furniture specific to the RKB Design Build Teams measurements, specifications and incorporated RKBs unique floor plan to allow for maximum work space.  Continuity in the systems furniture thought the RKB in paramount due to the availability and accessibility of repair parts currently on hand and previously paid for by the 5 collocated agencies and housed within the RKB Facility Management Department (FMD) storage area.  The integration of the other systems furniture would be incompatible, inconsistent and impractical with current system being used and may void any manufacture warrantee.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection AgencyAriel Rios Building1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W.Mail Code: 3805RWashingtonDC20460USA                           --Envrionmental Response Laboratory Network The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to change the closing date from December 28 2012 to July 9, 2013.  Please email applications to both Contacts below.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support.  Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR    Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. Potential vendors viability will be evaluated on the following six factors:  Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN).  The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on  criteria established by the EPA.  This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership. This requirement will be posted for approximately 180 days with an anticipated closing date of July 9,  2013   at 3:00 pm EST.  A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.  NO late applications will be accepted. Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to both contacts below at the EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below.  No phone calls please.  Please include your laboratory 9 Digit DUNS number with your application.

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This is not a solicitation announcement, nor is it a Request for Quote (RFQ). This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, is conducting market research seeking information on standard commercial practices for the acquisition of Oxygen and Acetylene to include cylinder rental. It is anticipated that the results of this market research will support the development of a RFQ for the requirement.</p>
<p>The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.</p>
<p>Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit a quote if and when a solicitation is issued.</p>
<p>The anticipated requirement is for Oxygen (CF 251 or 285) and Acetylene (Bottle Num 5), to include cylinder rental, to be provided for a period of one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The anticipated quantities are 60 cylinders of Oxygen and 30 cylinders of Acetylene. The Government will require delivery to one location with continued refill/replacement of the Oxygen and Acetylene cylinders.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting information on commercial industry standard practices, specifically:</p>
<p>1. What standard line items are usually charged commercially (i.e. gases initially delivered, cylinder rental charge, delivery charge, refill/replacement charge, HAZMAT charge, etc.)?</p>
<p>2. What is the most cost efficient way to establish the rental of cylinders (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly, annually)? Are there any other commercial pricing strategies that the Government should consider?</p>
<p>3. How is refill and delivery handled in the commercial industry? Is it more cost efficient for the Government to notify the contractor when cylinders on hand are empty and need replaced or is there a more cost efficient way to have the contractor schedule refill/replacement of cylinders at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.)? <br /><br />If standard commercial contracts are utilized in the industry, respondants are requested to provide a copy for the Government's information.<br /><br />Please provide any other information that may assist the Government in developing a RFQ that is more consistent with commercial industry standards. <br /><br />Responses must be provided no later than 3:00 PM EST on January 10, 2013 to Ms. Carole M. Householder via email at carole.householder@usace.army.mil.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Technical: Offer must clearly demonstrate that the offeror is capable of meeting the statement of work (SOW).</p>

The Government will initiate concurrent evaluation of all of the above factors on all offers. The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If the Government cannot determine if a proposal's Technical Performance factor is acceptable pursuant to initial or subsequent evaluation and the proposal, in the Government's judgment, is considered correctable, the Contracting Officer may open or continue discussions. If at any time during the evaluation, a proposal's Technical factor is determined to be unacceptable or not correctable pursuant to a proposal uncertainty, no further consideration will be given to that proposal for award. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective June 14, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the System for Award Management (SAM)website.  The SAM website can be accessed http://www.sam.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after February 3, 2013 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 3, 2012 (Refresh #20) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after February 3, 2013 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.

<DESC>NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 6 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a program requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. 

The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing solicitation number 2FYA-JD-060001-B Refresh 12 for Multiple Award Schedule 76 Publication Media, effective January 3, 2013.

Current contract holders under Schedule 76 for Publication Media do not need to re-apply. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Contracts under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award, and lasting for five years unless canceled or terminated. Three five-year option periods are possible under this contractual action.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide a vehicle for all Government agencies to obtain quality online and publication media resources when required from qualified and experienced contractor(s) under a Multiple Award Federal Supply Schedule in an efficient, streamlined, and cost effective manner in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 with a small business size standard of $14.0M. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The Advanced Network Technology Division (ANTD) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently is assessing the reliability of wireless sensor networks for the Smart Grid and their vulnerability to cyber-attack. In addition, much work has been done to evaluate the performance of various security protocols for distribution of metering information that covers neighborhood area networks (NAN). Specifically, NIST currently has a contract in which the contractor implemented two authentication protocols, namely Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and Efficient Mesh Security Association (EMSA), which have now been included in the NIST simulation testbed. While implementation of the mesh network has been completed, the next challenge is to develop a network for a wider area situational awareness.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a wireless network for future wide area measurement systems. It is specifically aimed at implementing a network testbed consisting of many Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) located at various key substations. PMUs are used to detect angular stability of the power grid system by sending synchrophasor data to the Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) located at the regional monitoring control center.</p>

<p>If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 (b) (11)): This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>

<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: All items must be new. Prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will not be considered for award. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Under the technical capability factor, stronger consideration will be given to equipment capable of providing the following additional capabilities: 1) As stated in specification 2h, stronger consideration will be given for systems that offer additional technology that reduces the etalon effects in the CCD detector; 2) As stated in specification 2i, stronger consideration will be given for systems that offer quantum efficiency of 75% or better at 950 nm.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center (TRAC) Monterey has a requirement Mission Command Analysis.  This Request for Quote seeks technical and price submissions for work to be done on site at TRAC Monterey.  The submissions shall provide resumes, past performance information and pricing in accordance with the criteria in the Performance Based Statement of Work (SOW) included in this RFQ.

Current operations are requiring units to deploy in smaller elements to forward operating bases (FOBs) and outposts throughout the Areas of Responsibility (AORs). These locations do not have the equipment or manpower to provide similar levels of force protection as larger FOBs.


The purpose of this purchase order (PO) is twofold.
 The first is to develop and apply a methodology to assess and prioritize gaps in current Force Protection capabilities for deployed forces on small forward operating bases (FOBs) and combat out-posts (COPs). The result of this effort will be a collection of scenarios in the Combined Arms Analysis Tool for the 21st Century (COMBATXXI), a high-resolution analytic combat simulation environment, to analyze and assess current and future force protection gaps of small FOBS and COPs. The second purpose is to assist in the implementation of Force Protection scenarios and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms in the Joint Dynamic Allocation of Fires and Sensors (JDAFS) in support of Mission Command Analysis.
 The result of this second effort will be a modification to JDAFS that enables the user to quickly implement MCTS methods to analyze mission command.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200025 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.
  




It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data
It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition.  However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.


Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. 
Technically Acceptable:  Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within DRM and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor is part of the Health Team in TAG.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The WASH Advisor is an integral part of the OFDA Health Team. OFDA addresses all disaster health risks with a strong focus on identifying and managing health risks in complex humanitarian emergencies.  In natural and complex emergencies, excess mortality results from malnutrition, malaria, measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. HIV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to excess mortality in disasters.  These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (children under five years of age, the elderly, and women). The team provides technical assistance to OFDA including assessments, proposal reviews, risk management, capacity building and technical innovations to address the major causes of excess morbidity and mortality.  Typical OFDA WASH interventions include hygiene education and promotion, establishment and/or rehabilitation of water sources, water testing, support for water user management committees, sanitation interventions, and/or other environmental health activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a WASH Advisor who will provide OFDA with technical assistance in program assessment and planning, strategy development and implementation, monitoring of WASH mitigation and response activities, and technical representation in worldwide forums and working groups.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The WASH Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:<br />&bull;	Serve as a WASH expert on the TAG Health Team in reviewing project proposals, field program progress, country strategies and any WASH-related public health issues;<br />&bull;	Contribute to the formulation and articulation of appropriate WASH strategies and policies for OFDA and the rest of the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency-related situations;<br />&bull;	Provide crucial technical expertise and recommendations to ensure that OFDA health responses, specifically those dealing with WASH issues are robust, rapid and appropriate;<br />&bull;	Monitor OFDA WASH-funded programs and provide assistance for improving outcomes;<br />&bull;	Provide the technical linkage between OFDA and other organizations, i.e. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Inter-Agency Steering Committee (IASC) WASH cluster, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and NGO partners that are involved in disaster and emergency response issues related to WASH;<br />&bull;	Maintain up-to-date, expert-level knowledge of the technical area and of the organizations engaged in related program activities;<br />&bull;	Serve as a technical expert and point of contact for senior professionals, senior officials and implementing partners on WASH issues;<br />&bull;	Become certified and serve as a Contracting Officer's Representative/Agreement Officer's Representative for contracts, grants,  and cooperative agreements under portfolio of responsibility;<br />&bull;	Serve as a technical authority on field assessment missions, DARTs and RMTs;<br />&bull;	When in the field, collaborate with the international response actors to support the host nation's capability to provide an effective response to specific health-related issues, especially in WASH;<br />&bull;	Serve as DCHA/OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The WASH Advisor will take direction from and report to the TAG Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined objectives and functions.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC.  OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia, Africa (AFR), Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and Middle East (ME).  OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises.  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on his/her own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level:</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull;	Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants/Program Managers as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as COR (Contracting Officer Representative) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull;	In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Respond to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, the Department of State, other USG agencies and departments, NGOs, international donors, and others interested in particular OTI country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Initiate and manage the preparation of documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including the work of contractors and grantees;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 level:</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform the same duties as the GS-11 level but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and greater independence of action.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to his/her respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations:  Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand.  The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions.  The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs.  The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull;	Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull;	Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull;	Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during  a disaster response;<br />&bull;	Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull;	Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /> <br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull;	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull;	Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team.  Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull;	Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull;	Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull;	Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.<br /> <br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor or his/her designee. However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the respective Team Leader in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."

As a reminder we are tax exempt and will provide an ST-2 and ST-5 before the event.   <br>   We understand this is difficult, please always give your best and final pricing; you may not be given a chance to adjust your proposals.   <br>    <br>   APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:  The following clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference.

<p>The following FAR Clauses apply to this solicitation. Interested companies may obtain full text versions of these clauses electronically at www.arnet.gov: FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb 2012); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms &amp; Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (May 2012).

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov and shall provide the company Tax Information Number (TIN) with their offer.</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This requirement includes but is not limited to supplies, equipment, tools, personnel, supervision and technical support to perform industrial water treatment for all steam boiler systems.
<p>This contract is anticipated to be a competitive 100% small business set-aside per the SBA and is expected to be solicited in Feb 2013. This will require pricing and a technical volume (including samples of the chemicals to be submitted separately), to be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA). The RFP will also include&nbsp;a generalized PWS (Performance Work Statement) for review by all interested contractors.</p>
<p>Contractors shall submit a letter verifying all components and weight percentages of the products they will provide. Samples are also required from each of the treatment products prior to award. <br /><br />A pre-bid site visit will be coordinated to allow contractors to take samples providing their own vials.

<p>All text above is subject to change once the requirement is firm. This is only a brief overview of the requirement and how it will be competed. Please direct any questions or concerns to A1C Lei Yang.</p>

<DESC>The Kiowa Warrior Product Management Office (KW PMO) has identified a potential need for replacement of the 5x7 quote mark  and 6x8 quote mark  multifunction displays on the OH-58D and OH-58F due to obsolescence. PM KW is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and fielding of a capability that enables the OH-58D/F platform to meet its MFD requirements. The replacement should ideally be non-developmental, plug and play with the current OH-58D and OH-58F architecture, and provide increased capability.  PM KW is seeking information on MFDs that provide onboard processing capability that can support both internal and external computing tasks as well as monitor type MFDs that solely display information provided directly from other computing sources such as mission computers, sensors etc.  If non-developmental solutions are not available, information on COTS solutions and what developmental changes would be required to meet specification requirements is requested.   <br>    <br>

<DESC>RFI for NVIS Compatible Lighting Improvement forC-130H2 Aircraft Fuel Quantity Gauges  <br>    <br>  As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.209 (c), the following provision is inserted:   <br>    <br>  IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997)   <br>    <br>  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.    <br>    <br>  (b) Although proposal and offers are used in this request for information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.   <br>    <br>  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on aircraft cockpit lighting technologies that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:  <br>    <br>  The Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is conducting an effort to determine potential sources for improving the night vision goggle compatible lighting for fuel gauges used in Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)  C-130H2 or earlier aircraft.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a request for proposal. This is not an R&D request.  <br>    <br>  AATC is seeking contractors interested in providing affordable, readily available NVIS compatible light system for the C-130H2 fuel gauges NSN 6680-012204091 (Fuel Gauge-Totalizer); and NSN 6680 01 220 4090, 6680 01 290 5920; 6680-013508049 (Fuel Gauge-Primary Quantity).  The system must provide a fully NVIS compatible solution by adding backlighting or an improved secondary lighting source.  This modification must use the latest military and/or commercial off-the shelf (COTS) technology that can be used as part of an Operational Assessment (OA).    <br>    <br>  System Requirements:   <br>    <br>   	NVIS compatible  <br>   	Solutions must ensure smooth and predictable dimming, equal or better than the legacy incandescent dimming design.   <br>   	Provide daylight readability.    <br>   	System should be form, fit and function using the existing wiring or with minor modification.  <br>   	System must be physically robust.  <br>   	LED technology preferred.  <br>   	System must allow instruments to maintain cooling characteristics.  <br>   	System should provide improvement over existing post lights/secondary lighting.  <br>   	System should prevent any glow or light leakage which may cause non-NVIS compatibility.   <br>    <br>  Objective of OA is to demonstrate and validate potential solutions for recommendation for fielding options within the next 1-3 years.  Proposed start dates for testing is 1 Mar 2013.  Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OA.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.  Mission effectiveness and safety are key considerations.  <br>    <br>  Interested parties capable of providing a NVIS compatible system that meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of system capabilities. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research. The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify the system capability as related to the technical effort requested. A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by 7 Jan 2013.  Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system.   <br>    <br>  Please e-mail all information and SOC to the AATC Contracting Officer, SMSgt Jonathan Wood, at jonathan.wood.1@ang.af.mil. For programmatic questions or technical questions contact John Wilkens at john.wilkens@ang.af.mil or Herbert Colon at herbert.colon.ctr@ang.af.mil. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis.

(1) Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. In the event an offeror proposes products that are other than the Brand Name specified, the offeror shall submit with its proposal information sufficient to comply with the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal as follows: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- (1)	Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by- (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. (2) Price - The prices offered shall be submitted in accordance with the Schedule of Supplies and Services contained in the solicitation. Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. (End of Text) <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: (1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the CLIN descriptions, Submission of Quotes, and Evaluation of Quotes and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. (b) The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

As stated duing the RFI site visit, the Government anticipates holding one-on-one site visits for the purpose taking masurements, looking in manholes, overheads, etc. These visits will be scheduled during the RFP phase.
 
Vendors are also reminded, participation as a prime in the RFP phase will only be considered from vendors that attended the RFI site visit.
 
Per the RFI / Sources Sought, those wishing to partner as a prime or a subcontractor can indicate such in their white paper submission.
We will provide contact information in the RFP phase. The Government will provide no further facilitation.
 
The purpose of the RFI / Sources Sought is to determine Vendors POTENTIAL to complete the required work, to refine the PWS and to determine the acquisition strategy. Therefore, the decision on the set-aside status, if any, will depend on the POTENTIAL presented in the RFI / Sources Sought submissions. While RFI submissions are not mandatory, they are highly suggested for the noted reasons.

OSC Directly supports TSA's mission by providing security capabilities to the field. OSC continues to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our nation's transportation systems through the qualification and deployment of security capabilities that drive the global standard for security.</p>
<p>In 2008 and prior there were over a dozen Professional Service type contracts in place to support OSC, which presented a lack of efficiency, scope overlap, and was administratively burdensome. As a result, in 2009 the existing contracts were consolidated into a few primary service type contracts (e.g. Program Management, Engineering, and Testing). As performance under these contracts progressed, these contracts presented a limitation in small business, flexibility, and ability to meet surge requirements so additional "Gap Filler" contracts were awarded. Because one (1) of the Primary Service Type Contracts (i.e. Program Management) is scheduled to end in May 2013, the TSA is taking this as an opportunity to re-evaluate the Program Management and many of the other Professional Service type contracts in place to further improve efficiencies. The TSA is seeking Industry's ideas on how to efficiently and effectively re-compete the Program Management Support Services Contract, while taking into consideration the scope of the other Professional Service type contracts currently in place for OSC.<br /><br />Currently, the TSA has the following enterprise contracts in place for OSC: 1) Program Management Support (GS-10F-06-LP-A0005/ HSTS04-08-F-CT8600); Professional Engineering and Logistics Support Services (PELSS) (HSTS04-10-D-CT7006 and HSTS04-10-D-CT7007); and Test and Evaluation Support Services (TESS) (HSTS04-10-D-ST3065 and HSTS04-10-D-ST3066).&nbsp; In addition to these enterprise contracts, the TSA has several miscellaneous Program Management Support Contracts.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

  (a) In an effort to achieve socioeconomic small business goals, depending on the evaluation factors included in the solicitation, VA shall evaluate offerors based on their service-disabled veteran-owned or veteran-owned small business status and their proposed use of eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors.
  (b) Eligible service-disabled veteran-owned offerors will receive full credit, and offerors qualifying as veteran-owned small businesses will receive partial credit for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-owned Small Business Status evaluation factor. To receive credit, an offeror must be registered and verified in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database. (http://www.VetBiz.gov).

Offerors must state in their proposals the names of the SDVOSBs and VOSBs with whom they intend to subcontract and provide a brief description of the proposed subcontracts and the approximate dollar values of the proposed subcontracts. In addition, the proposed subcontractors must be registered and verified in the VetBiz.gov VIP database (http://www.vetbiz.gov).
(End of Clause)
C.5   VAAR 852.215-71 EVALUATION FACTOR COMMITMENTS (DEC 2009)
  The offeror agrees, if awarded a contract, to use the service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses proposed as subcontractors in accordance with 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, or to substitute one or more service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses for subcontract work of the same or similar value.
(End of Clause)
C.6   VAAR 852.246-71 INSPECTION (JAN 2008)
  Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account.
(End of Clause)
C.7   VAAR 852.273-76 ELECTRONIC INVOICE SUBMISSION (Interim - October 2008)
  (a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.
