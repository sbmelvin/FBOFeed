<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)intends to sole source this requirement for incidental docketing, tracking payment and report services for non domestic patents to Computer Packages, Inc. Rockville, MD for the services specified below:
BACKGROUND

The Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), USDA, ARS and the Forest Service (FS) requires services to docket, track, and report quarterly on the status of foreign patents including the payment of annuities, taxes and maintenance fees to maintain existing patents in force.  Currently, there are approximately 800 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Applications/International Patents for which annuities, taxes, and maintenance fees may become due and payable.

United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) sponsors research on new and useful products and processes which have potential application in the private and public sectors, and may seek patent rights in various foreign countries covering products and processes derived from the ARS Research.  ARS is the major research agency of the USDA and receives over 80 percent of the total patents.  USDA has the authority, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207 and 15 U.S.C. 3710, to obtain and maintain patents in the United States and foreign countries.  USDA can grant licenses in accordance with the regulations set forth in 37 C.F.R. Chapter IV, as amended, to receive fees, royalties or other revenues therefrom, and to take all other suitable and necessary steps to protect and administer such rights.

ARS has a history of research collaborations with industry and academia.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, ARS has implemented a technology transfer program covering a variety of agricultural technologies that have high commercial potential to industry.  Patent applications possessing licensable beneficial foreign rights are being filed and prosecuted in foreign countries.


To serve public interest, the Government will ensure that the results of Federally-sponsored research be protected, marketed, and practiced so that maximum benefit is achieved in the form of enhanced U.S. economic activity and competitiveness.  The countries chosen for patent protection may include both member and non-member countries of the PCT.  

ARS researchers currently report over 100 inventions annually.  During Fiscal Year 2004, 150 inventions were reported, 63 were filed for domestic patents and 59 patents were issued.  During the same period, 24 PCT applications were filed.  The Department has a total current patent portfolio of 2034, for which there are approximately 800 foreign filings corresponding to 99 different U.S. filings.  The above information is for historical purposes only and comprises typical annual activity count for ARS.

<DESC>The Government of Jordan (GOJ) has requested USAID to
continue with a major program that can assist in
enhancing Jordan's competitiveness in global markets,
deepen the public sector reform process and increase
the number of jobs available for Jordanians in the
economy.  A five year program known as the Sustainable Achievement of Business Expansion and Quality (SABEQ) has been designed to address this need. 

The GOJ and USAID agree that: 

1) there are significant second generation regulatory
and legal reforms that must be made in order to
enhance Jordan's ability to attract increased local
and foreign direct investment; 

2) the private sector remains dominated by small and
medium enterprises that have not yet adopted modern
management principles and are not investing in the
necessary research and development or marketing
themselves in order to become competitive in a global
economy; and 

3) weak capacity in both the public and private
sectors reduces the number of new jobs being created
that are needed to grow the economy.  Based on seven
years of successes during the implementation of the
AMIR program, it was decided to develop another
large-scale economic growth program that would build
on lessons learned, adopt new approaches to suit the
changing environment in Jordan, and promote the Jordan
National Agenda (JNA) reform plan.

SABEQ is proposed as part of USAID/Jordan's Strategic Objective 10 (SO10): "Improved Economic Opportunities for Jordanians".  The program will directly support all three Intermediate Results: 

IR 1: "More Transparent, Efficient and Responsive Public Sector"; 

IR 2: "More Effective Legal and Regulatory Environment"; and 

IR 3: "Increased Depth of Private Sector Growth".  

To address these problems, SABEQ will work with both
the public and private sectors to achieve two
principle goals: 1) increasing the number of jobs
available to Jordanians; and 2) enhancing Jordan's competitiveness.

The SABEQ Program will have four components as
described below.  Woven through each one will be a
public outreach activity and a small grants program. 
Under each component, there will be both public and
private sector activities and opportunities for both
sectors to engage with one another.

- Financial Integrity and Oversight, and Broadened Capital Markets 

- Removal of GOJ Constraints to Achieving Private Sector Competitiveness

- Expanded Trade and Investment

- Enhanced Productivity (Improved People/Improved Product)

<RESPDATE>041206
<ARCHDATE>02132007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a pasture facility to maintain up to 4,400 wild horses from October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facility must be located in one of the following states: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska or Oklahoma. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program. Some of the horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are currently being cared for by the Shadow 7 Ranch in Cassoday, Kansas. The purpose of this contract is to continue the maintenance of these animals for the remainder of their lives. The possibility exists that more unadoptable animals will be removed from the range and transported to the facility. This is not the preferred management method for these animals; however, on occasion it will be necessary to place animals at the facility, on an as needed basis. It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older or have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This will require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the Cassoday, Kansas facility during the course of the contract. All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering. All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. The horses currently being maintained at the Cassoday facility are a non-reproductive herd consisting of primarily older horses in the age range of 6 to 30 years old. They consist of geldings and mares, with no stallions in the herd. Some of these horses have been maintained at the Cassoday facility for approximately 5 years. The objectives of this contract are: To maintain the unadopted excess wild horses currently located at the Cassoday facility in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable animals; to minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; to provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks. Specific requirements for each are set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of the Description/Specifications/Work Statement. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain a maximum of 4,400 wild horses (mares and geldings) grazing in pastures. The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content, or when other circumstances warrant). Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis. Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. Gather and hold horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment. Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw blood samples for horses prior to shipment. Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations. Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc. The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI. Dispose of the remains of dead horses. The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35 to 40 head per load. The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments. BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival. However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time. The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups. All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner. Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling. Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses. The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement. Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices. Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI. The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI. A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather. The gather will be conducted in a humane manner. Horses will be maintained separate in a corral area for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment. Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facility to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment. The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals. The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. This solicitation will be available on or about February 27, 2006. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr..gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order for sample analysis with Brooks Rand using simplified acquisition procedures.  The period of performance is anticipated to be twelve (12) months starting March, 2006.  The requirement is for sample analysis in support of a study modeling biogeochemistry and trophic transfer of mercury within a contaminated riparian wetland.  The research project builds on an ongoing risk assessment of mercury contamination in the top predators within the Great Meadows National  Wildlife Refuge, an extensive riparian wetland on the Sudbury River in Massachusetts.  Work to be accomplished under the purchase order is a continuation of research previously performed by the proposed awardee under another EPA purchase order. The EPA believes that Brooks Rand is the only source  capable of satisfying the Government's requirements as stated above.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one  source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide the requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Any response failing to  provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFQ will be ignored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of  this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  No RFP/RFQ is available.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.   No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained.  The location should provide regularly scheduled public transportation and employee parking within convenient walking distance of the offered building sufficient to cover commuting needs of employees.

<DESC>2006 Design-Bid-Build Brussels Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation Project

CHANCERY RENOVATION  QUALIFICATION ONLY 



THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Bid-Build construction services for the renovation of an existing office building, Bi-lateral Mission Chancery, Brussels, Belgium. The construction contract is expected to be awarded prior to September 30, 2006. Actually, construction is not expected to begin until issuance of a Notice to Proceed. Performance period of this project from Notice to Proceed issuance is anticipated to be 18 months. This project does require the use of cleared American workers. The contract type for this project will be firm fixed-price. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 



SALMEC-06-R0038: Brussels, Belguim, Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation: 6,000 gsm, Estimated Bid Build cost range $10 to $15 million.


Background Information

This US Government owned Chancery, constructed by the Department in 1952 is situated on a one-third acre lot.  The 6,000 gsm Chancery is comprised of a seven-story "tower" portion on Boulevard du Regent and a two-story back wing which abuts the CMR. The building forms a "U" shape around a paved interior courtyard and a full basement extends under the entire floor plate of the building including the tower, low wing and courtyard.  This level was originally constructed as a parking garage; evidence of the irregular column spacing and ramps still exist.  A sub-basement was built under the tower portion of the building, which is comprised of the building's mechanical services.

The entire building, with the exception of the top floor was constructed with cast-in-place concrete columns, beams, joists, floor and roof slabs.  The top floor of the tower is framed with structural steel, which is roofed with a concrete slab. The exterior walls of the Chancery are clad with flat (French) limestone panels set in a stacked pattern.  The original aluminum (double insulated glass) windows are set in punched openings.


Project Solicitation

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Pass/Fail Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

Phase I

MANDATORY PREQUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to United States person bidders. Each company responding to this notice shall contact the DOS Contract Specialist for a copy of the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant To Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986."  (The pamphlet is contained in the FEDBIZOPPS announcement.)  The pamphlet must be completed and included as part of the pre-qualifications package. If a joint venture is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Offerors must receive a pass rating in this area before proceeding to the next step in the evaluation process. Information on the US persons requirements may be viewed at:
http://www.statebuy.state.gov/grants/authorities.htm#procurement


SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT

In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the pre-qualified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a joint venture, must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. If a pre-qualified firm does not possess the necessary DoD FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time they are determined to be pre-qualified. The Department of State will allow 90 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of Phase II of the RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the FCL. The Government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.

Security clearances must be in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information or to the Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must also possess a Secret or Interim Secret personnel security clearance issued by DSS. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required pre-qualification documentation. All firms must comply with security requirements detailed in the NISPOM.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-01-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Feb 05; FY 06 by 1 June 05; FY 07 by 1 June 06; FY 08 by 1 June 07 and, FY 09 by 1 June 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 July 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

WAVEFORM OPTIMIZATION FOR MULTI-SENSOR MULTI-MODE APPLICATIONS.   The objective of this task is to develop radar transmit waveform strategies, and their associated receive processing methods, for single and multi-mode operations for monostatic and multi-static radar applications.  The waveforms should exploit the potential degrees of freedom (DOF) on the platform(s) and consider the electromagnetic environment with which they interact. The goal is to improve air and ground moving target indication (AMTI, GMTI) and imaging by adjusting the transmit waveform using spatial, temporal, frequency and polarization diversity in the radar transmitter and across available distributed sensors.  Feedback from the receive platform(s) should also be considered to adjust the waveform(s) for the next pulse repetition interval.  A waveform optimization process must be developed to determine what waveform is transmitted so that it exploits its expected electromagnetic interaction with the surrounding clutter, i.e. multi-path scattering.  Illumination from one to multiple sensors, either cooperatively or non-cooperatively, should be considered.  The sensors would be potentially distributed therefore yielding a geometrically diverse aspect, however spatial diversity on a single platform should also be exploited, i.e. independent control of a phased array’s sub-apertures.    Also to be considered are the use of multiple receive platforms that can operate either passively or actively.  Coherent processing is essential and techniques of coherently combining multiple receive sensors signals for improved mission performance must be developed.  Multi-mode operation from a distributed collection of sensors (multi-statics) is also of interest for simultaneous combinations of AMTI, GMTI, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modes.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Innovativeness of the Proposed Approach and/or Techniques – How innovative is the approach compared to the current state-of-the art in this particular area, (2) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit – Addresses a current problem effecting a desired technology with a logical approach, (3) Past Performance/Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology, domain knowledge, and a capable and qualified staff,  (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

At this time most of the work that will be conducted under this BAA will be unclassified.  But depending on the work proposed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POCs, Dr. Peter Zulch, 315-330-7861, Peter.Zulch@rl.af.mil or Howard Mitch Beyer, 315-330-1476, Howard.Beyer@rl.af.mil.
 
Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, 315-330-1955, Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.

All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.

DESC: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Science Education (OSE) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8 (a) firms to develop a curriculum supplement on bioethics for high school general biology classes. The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 61170 with a size standard of $6.5 million

The offeror will develop a curriculum supplement for high school general biology classes on the ethical issues surrounding selected biomedical practices, such as clinical research, genetic screening, and vaccinations. The supplement will be a teacher’s guide consisting of 1) detailed instructions on conducting five classroom lessons, 2) masters for copying student worksheets and other paper-based resources used during the lessons, 3) a teacher’s section on the scientific and ethical content, 4) a section detailing the pedagogical design of the lessons, 5) a section aligning the lessons to the National Science Education Standards (see www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses), 6) a section discussing how the lessons fit into common high school general biology curricula, and 7) a list of relevant references and resources.
 
The offerer will be required to 1) use the National Science Education Standards in designing and developing the supplement; 2) interact with NIH staff frequently throughout the contract period; 3) field test the lessons in schools that represent the intellectual and diversity spectrum found in secondary schools across the nation (test sites must include, but shall not be limited to, a high school in the Washington DC metropolitan area); 4) develop a Web site to house PDF and HTML versions of the supplement including any multimedia components of the student lessons; and 5) provide a formatted copy of the final curriculum supplement in InDesign or Quark Express format including all linked images (as gray scale or cmyk, depending on how the image should print) ready for professional printing. 

NIH intends for the curriculum supplement to be freely reproduced for classroom use and to be freely distributed to educators across the nation. NIH does not intend for the materials to be used by any organization for sale or profit. 

This supplement will enrich existing curricular materials, assist high school biology teachers in attaining their educational goals, and engage students in developing critical and ethical thinking skills. Students will gain an understanding of specific biomedical practices by engaging in the lessons within the supplement. They will identify and study the ethical issues that arise as these practices are implemented in society. Students will then examine their own values and beliefs, come to a conclusion that fits within these values and beliefs, and articulate and justify their position on the ethical issues surrounding the biomedical practices.

The core of the supplement will be five stand-alone lessons, each taking one or two 45-minute class periods to complete. These lessons should be designed so that they are easily integrated into the topics commonly studied in general biology classes in high schools nationwide. Laboratory and computer-based activities may be used when they will enhance the students’ learning experience. However, all computer-based activities must have a paper-and-pencil alternative. The supplement’s design must be consistent with other NIH curriculum supplements (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements).

All materials developed for the curriculum supplement must be in two formats: print and Web ready. All multimedia must be Web ready and operable using Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer Web browsers in Macintosh and Windows platforms. IBM Domino/Notes is OSE’s primary Web server and the application for internal collaborative tasks.  All Web development work by the offeror must run under Domino/Notes 7.0 CF (or above). Any database constructed for a student lesson must be designed using Lotus Notes. All Web pages must be in accordance with Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (1998). Each Web page of the final product must conform to the NIH Curriculum Supplement Series Web Style Guide (see science.education.nih.gov/supplements/styleguide). 

The offeror must be a nationally recognized curriculum development organization with experience in producing high-quality, field-tested life science curricula for grades 9 - 12 that are currently being used in schools nationwide. The offeror must present a team with the following expertise: 1) life science curriculum developers and educators who have been successful in teaching a diverse range of students; 2) technical writers who are knowledgeable about biomedical issues; 3) specialists in state-of-the-art educational technologies; 4) scientists with experience in biomedical practices, biotechnology and bioethics; and 5) Web developers/Multimedia specialists with proven experience working with IBM Domino/Notes and designing Section 508-compliant Web pages. 

The offerer will design the supplement using a research-based, student-centered approach to instruction. The educational design philosophy of the supplement should be consistent with the National Science Education Standards and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy (see www.project2061.org/publications/bsl). The Standards and Benchmarks apply to all students, regardless of age, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in science. The supplement should emphasize how basic and clinical research contributes to our knowledge of diseases and leads to advances in health care. It should also illustrate the multiplicity of approaches to solving problems on scientific and bioethical issues. The lessons should provide students with opportunities to understand basic, clinical, and bioethical research. They should be dynamic, engaging, and relevant to high school students. The offeror will indicate how the lessons will be tested and evaluated to assess their effectiveness in meeting the learning objectives. The offeror and OSE will meet frequently throughout the entire contract period to ensure that the supplement is scientifically accurate and that the lessons provide creative learning experiences applicable to all students nationwide. The offerer will present mechanisms for ensuring scientific accuracy using their own experts and include a plan for interacting with NIH scientists for content review. The offeror will also provide realistic time lines for development of the supplement and show thoughtful consideration for the needs of teachers with diverse student populations. 

NIH intends to negotiate a multi-year contract for a period of two years. Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information. Any major proposed collaborations between the offerer and other entities must have been established prior to this survey and proven effective in producing high-quality science curricula that are currently being used in schools nationwide. If significant collaboration and subcontracting is anticipated to deliver technical capability, the offeror must show that they possess the administrative and management infrastructure to maintain full-time technical and managerial control of the project. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of a capability statement to the address above within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date this notice appears. Each firm must provide samples of curricular products they designed and developed that are currently being used in the classroom. Firms should also include executive summaries of field tests or formal evaluations conducted for these materials. This market survey is being conducted through the Federal Business Opportunity Web site (see www.fedbizopps.gov) to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.

In order to bid on this requirement, a firm must be registered in the GSA Acquisition Management System (ITSS). If you are not currently registered, you may do so by going to it-solutions.gsa.gov and following the registration instructions. The description of the requirement is as follows: 

1.0 BACKGROUND:

The US  Soldier Battle Lab Ft. Benning conducts live experimentations and Technical demonstrations in support of the future soldier’s combat development. In order to facilitate and document tactical troop maneuvers soldiers are equipped with a man-worn instrumentation device, which monitors, tracks and records movements and engagements. This device is a combination of a localized communications server and long haul RF data radio. This custom built soldier tracking device has been in operation for 3 years. In an effort to maximize the use of the latest technologies and a continuous effort to ruggedize instrumented soldier worn devices for military environments, this activity is seeking proposals for an enhanced version (next generation) of this soldier worn communication server.   

2. DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT DEVICE:

The concept of this man worn server has already been tested utilizing the MOUT simulation system. This device is a collection of standard off the shelf OEM boards housed in a single enclosure integrated on a custom motherboard. The device uses a standard Microhard 910 MHz radio and a multi port Bluetooth serial server and a Rabbit microprocessor controller. The current communication software was written using the Z World microprocessor specific dynamic C. Block diagram as (email kristen.eaves@gsa.gov for drawing).

3. DESCRIPTION OF MCKENNA ADVANCED COMMUNICATION SERVER (MACS)

This contract is for the development of  a prototype hardware device which will serve as an upgrade model for the next generation of CommServer devices used at this facility for all future replacement and expansion requirements. The contractor will be responsible to search out current advanced technologies and integrate into a complete communication device. The government will provide one sample device along with proper documentation. This device will provide PDAs and other processors a BT enabled bi-directionally communication device with a base station radio farm. The concept has already been tested at MOUT using a standard Microhard 910 MHz radio and a Bluetooth serial connector device and an IPAQ PDA. The BT/Radio device to be built in this quotation is a consolidation of the Microhard radio with the Bluetooth serial connector into a single hardened box. Additional diagnostic and configuration software will be provided to configure this box and monitor communication status.

<DESC>The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey for a contract to collect and analyze data related to health services utilization by persons with HIV infection during CY 2006-2008.  It is anticipated that only one award will be made.  This contract will continue support for the HIV Research Network, which is currently supported by a contract that will end on September 30, 2006.
Sources must demonstrate that they have access to data from medical records from a number of different providers of HIV care in different regions of the U.S.  The current HIV Research Network has obtained patient-level data from 17 different HIV care provider sites;  to maintain the scope of the project, sources must show that they can obtain data from at least 17 HIV clinical sites across the U.S..  At least one provider must be in each of the four U.S. Census regions.  The current HIV Research Network has developed a longitudinal database that covers the years 2000-2005.  Sources must demonstrate not only that they will be able to collect data for CY 2006-2008, but also that they can merge these data at the patient level with comparable data for CY 2003-2005, to maintain the longitudinal aspect of the database.
Each participating data provision site will abstract information from medical records of patients receiving care for HIV infection at that site.  Data will be abstracted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and submitted to a Data Coordinating Center by July of the following year.  To maintain continuity with data gathered under the current HIVRN contract, sites will provide data on all data elements currently collected by the HIVRN:  1) demographic characteristics, including insurance coverage;  2)clinical information, including results of CD4 and viral load tests and diagnoses of comorbidities; 3) inpatient admissions, including length of stay and discharge diagnoses;  4) outpatient visits, including visit dates and CPT codes; 5) ER episodes, including whether the ER visit resulted in an inpatient admission;  6) detailed information on antiretroviral medications prescribed, including start and stop dates; 7) and information on mental illness and substance abuse, including diagnoses and receipt of mental health or substance abuse treatment. 
Sources must have an understanding of and, preferably, experience in, health services research. Sources must also possess clinical expertise in the current treatments for HIV infection.  Sources must have experience in data processing and cleaning, developing large longitudinal databases, as well as expertise in multivariate statistical analysis of clinical and resource utilization data.
Interested organizations capable of performing the above and with the requisite qualifications and expertise should submit, no later than March 1, 2006, a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet AHRQ’s requirements as described above.  Capability statement should be no longer than 10 pages and may include appendices for resumes, etc.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at swilliam@ahrq.gov or hard copies (original and two copies) may be sent by mail to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements received after March 1, 2006, will not be reviewed nor considered.  A determination by the Government to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of AHRQ.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation or Request for Proposal document is currently available.

THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS MEASURE EDE PERFORMANCE IN INSPECTING REPRESENTATIVE IEDS AT THE POINT OF ENTRY ONTO MILITARY INSTALLATIONS UNDER TYPICAL POINT OF ENTRY OPERATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. 2.1. DETECTION EFFECTIVENESS, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE, CONSISTS OF THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL IED DETECTIONS COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS OF INTEREST INSPECTED. 2.1.1. SUCCESSFUL DETECTIONS INCLUDE: A) TRUE POSITIVES - EDE DETERMINES THE PRESENCE OF EXPLOSIVES IN IEDS. B) TRUE NEGATIVES - EDE DETERMINES THAT EXPLOSIVES ARE NOT PRESENT WHEN EXPLOSIVES ARE NOT PRESENT. 2.1.2. UNSUCCESSFUL DETECTIONS INCLUDE: A) FALSE POSITIVES - EDE DETERMINES T!  HAT THERE ARE EXPLOSIVES PRESENT WHEN EXPLOSIVES ARE NOT PRESENT, AND  B) FALSE NEGATIVES - EDE DETERMINES THAT THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIVES PRESENT WHEN EXPLOSIVES ARE PRESENT. 2.1.3. IED MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING EXPLOSIVES: ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, SEMTEX, CHLORATES, WATER GELS, BLACK POWDERS, SMOKELESS POWDERS, PERCHLORATES, PEROXIDES AND DYNAMITES. 2.2. DETECTION SPEED, MEASURED IN OBJECTS OF INTEREST PER HOUR, IS THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS OF INTEREST (MAIL, PARCELS, PALLETS OF CARGO, PERSONS, OR VEHICLES) THAT CAN BE FULLY INSPECTED PER HOUR, ONCE THE EDE IS OPERATIONAL. INSPECTING TIME IS DEFINED AS THE MINIMUM TIME INTERVAL POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE START OF AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND THE START OF THE SUCCEEDING OBJECT OF INTEREST AT THE POINT OF ENTRY, E. G. TOTAL TIME FOR INSPECTOR TO COLLECT SAMPLES FROM VEHICLE AT INSPECTION POINT, AND THE SUBSEQUENT COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AT THE GUARD HOUSE. EDE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS TIME FOR THAT OBJECT OF INTEREST (EXCLUDING INITIAL EDE OPERATION TIME, SELF-CHECKS, ETC.) 2.3. EASE OF USE IS A SUBJECTIVE EVA!  LUATION BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF AN OPERATOR SURVEY, WHICH ASSESS THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY OF OPERATION.  2.4. TRANSPORTABILITY/PORTABILITY CONSISTS OF TWO FUNCTIONS - TRANSPORT OF THE MAIN COMPONENT OF THE EDE TO THE POINT OF ENTRY ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITY, AND THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF THE EDE TO ALLOW ANALYSIS BY THE MAIN COMPONENT OF THE EDE. THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE ASSESSED IN TERMS OF THE TIME, MANPOWER AND SITUATIONAL NEEDS OF OPERATORS MANNING THE POINT OF ENTRY. 2.5. RELIABILITY IS MEASURED BY THE DEGREE THAT THE EDE WILL COMPLETE THE EDE MISSION WITHOUT AN OPERATIONAL MISSION FAILURE FOR ALL OBJECTS REQUIRING SCREENING. INABILITY OF EDE TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF AN EXPLOSIVE CONSTITUTES AN OPERATIONAL MISSION FAILURE. 2.6. MAINTAINABILITY (MEAN TIME BETWEEN MAINTENANCE), MEASURED IN HOURS, IS THE DURATION OF TIME THAT, ON AVERAGE THE EDE WILL FUNCTION AS DESIGNED WITHOUT MAINTENANCE BEYOND ACTIONS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED BY THE OPERATOR WITH A PRESCRIBED LIST OF SP!  ARE PARTS AND/OR CONSUMABLE SUPPLIES. 3. STANDARD CONDITIONS AND THREA T.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cryogenics Technologies Group, Boulder CO proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Janis Research Company, 2 Jewel Drive, Wilmington, MA 01887-0696 for a closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator system.  NIST's project requires relatively high cooling power. The model SRDK-415D-W71C system meets the expected needs.

There are currently no other refrigerators that can provide 1.5 Watts of cooling power at 4K. This refrigerator is the current standard where these applications are needed. There are other refrigerators that can obtain 4 Kelvin temperatures but they can only provide up to 1.0 Watts of cooling power. That limits its capability and would not be an adequate refrigerator for NIST’s experimental requirements. NIST’s minimum requirements for the refrigerator are to operate at 4 kelvin with a heat load capacity of 1.5 Watts. The experiments will involve heat loss measurements on regenerator systems using various regenerator designs and materials.

Other cryocooler companies offer low temperature applications but do not meet the heat load capacities of 1.5 Watts at the 4.2 K requirements. NIST also requires the Gifford-McMann (GM) cryocooler technology instead of the pulse tube cryocooler technology because of the physical orientation that will be required for these experiments. NIST needs to operate the system in many different physical directions and the pulse tube design operates efficiently only when in the downward position. NIST needs to operate the cold head in a 360 degree radius, having the cold head of the refrigerator rotate clockwise around a fixed center point. The GM design cryocoolers can operate efficiently with the cold end direction not having any effect on its performance or efficiency. The pulse tube performance and efficiency is affected when it is not operated in the downward position. The performance ratings are based on this position and NIST will not be operating the cryocooler in that position.  Along with not meeting the heat load requirements at 4.2 kelvin the orientation limits of the pulse tube cryocooler would not meet NIST’s experimental requirements. 

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. No Solicitation is available. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before February 28, 2006. Anticipated award date is March 1, 2006.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is looking for sources who can provide the agency with the ability to capture real time real world comprehensive data from a coal underground mine section and enable the Government to  produce a 3 dimensional view of the mine section that allows the user to view the area from any position.  The product will produce a view that is completely navigable and that produces distance, area, and volume. 

The proposed system must utilize a LIDAR imaging system with intelligent pixel programming that tracks GPS location, maintains three dimensional coordinate tracking, color, 3-D imaging and produces a 360 degree view of an underground mine location.  The image must be pixel specific.  The image must allow total freedom scrolling within the scene and permit high accuracy measurements to be taken between selected points on the image to the pixel level.  Image information must capable of direct input to CAD.  File size must efficient enough to permit e-mail transfer of the file.  The equipment must be easily transportable and usable within the confines of an underground coal mine.  

Interested firms that possess a system that will fulfill the above requirements, should respond no later than 3:00 pm EST Wednesday, February 22, 2006 with a detailed description of the system explaining how their system provides the above functionality.  Solutions must be demonstrable systems, not developmental or proposed solutions.  

Responders may be required to provide a demonstration of their system.  This demonstration will be conducted in an actual coal mine and will include actual mining equipment used on the section.  

Only prime contractors should respond. The point of contact for this action is Mr. Robert Beaty, Mine Health and Safety Administration, 1100 Wilson Blvd, Room 2133, Arlington, VA 22209-3939. PH (202)693-9836, FAX (202) 693-9826, E-mail: beaty.robert@dol.gov . Responses to this sources sought should be sent to Mr. Robert Beaty at the address stated above not later than 22 February 2006. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be forwarded only to those firms responding to this notice.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), in conjunction with the Robotic Systems Joint Program Office (RSJPO), Huntsville, AL is seeking information from industry regarding the availability of mature Robotic Systems technologies to evaluate the possibility of augmenting the currently fielded Multi Function Agile Remote-Controlled Robot (MARCbot) Robotic System.   The Robot System will be used in a variety of harsh and dirty environments.  The MARCBOT is a robot that U.S. Army soldiers are currently using to help identify unknown items and provide visibility of non line of sight operations.   The government has a set of drawings that can be provided to sources certified as capable of providing the requirements. There may be a requirement to have some or all of the systems built to be backward compatible with existing systems.
The number of Robotic Systems bought will range from approximately several hundred to a thousand.


The existing Robotic Systems has the following features:
        *       Remote observation capability required
        *       Camera providing daytime/nighttime mission capability
        *       Pan/tilt camera can be raised to a height for viewing the tops of boxes, and looking into cans and over burlap sacks
        *       Platform is able to navigate most curbs
        *       Powered by military standard x90 batteries (BB-2590, BB-390) 
        *       Low-cost platform intended as a disposable-type asset to address otherwise problematic technical support/logistics of complex, expensive robots.

Current Approximate Specifications:
        *       Width: Ability to navigate narrow openings
        *       Height: Allow for appropriate center of gravity
        *       Weight: Light enough for easy control
        *       Power Source: BB2590 or BB-390
        *       Max Range: Line of sight and Non-line of sight.
        *       Pan/Tilt Camera: Fixed-focus, high-resolution, Low-Lux, color camera


The current strategy is for an anticipated RFP release date of 3rdQTR FY2006.  A firm-fixed-price production contract is desired.  The delivery schedule of the Robotic Systems is not later than 12 months after contract award. 

Information and comments, whether supportive or critical, are solicited.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information
solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of information.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted it should be marked accordingly.

Responses to this synopsis shall answer the following questions:

1.  Describe your company's approach for meeting the above requirement.

2.  Identify any commercial item solutions that may satisfy this requirement. 

3.      Describe your present technical capability and past history of meeting similar requirements.

4.   Describe the technical risk and problem areas for the requirement.

5.    Provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) Cost Estimate if possible and timeline of major milestones.  Include range pricing and
other quantity price breaks if appropriate.

6.   What is the size status of your company in relation to the SIC code stated below?
  
The information contained in this notice and on the PEO STRI and NAWC-TSD Home Pages is for planning purposes only and does not
constitute a request for proposal.  The Government reserves the right to offer the requirement to the 8(a) program or to set the
requirement aside for small business.  The anticipated SIC Code for this program is 3812, and NAICS Code is 334511.  If your company does not qualify under these codes, please submit your applicable code to the POC listed for evaluation and consideration.   

Those interested should respond by submitting information and answers to the questions contained herein, in writing, to Duane St
Peter, Contract Specialist, Dana Graham Contracting Officer or Joanne Byrd, Contracting Officer, at the above address by February 28, 2006.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

Agilent is the only company whose microarrays are manufactured with specific controls that are recognized by the Feature Extraction software used to analyze the images.  The loss of these controls will compromise the analysis.  The Agilent microarrays have specific control features that are recognized by National Ocean Service’s instrumentation which allows maximum data mining and quality assurance.  NOS scientists have 2 years of data processed with these products and the cost to migrate similar products would cost approximately twice as much as the Agilent consumables.

<DESC>Section 1 General Job Description:  Hazardous fuels reduction on approximately 7,881 acres.  These acres are all on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands within the Burns Interagency Fire Protection Zone (BIFZ) of Eastern Oregon.  The units requiring treatment are typical of Great Basin fuel types with rolling topography and Mean Sea Level (MSL) altitudes ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  Mechanically treated juniper red slash are the fuels to be reduced by aerial ignition.  The units will be burned to break up fuel loading continuity, leave some fuel on the ground, eliminate enough fuels to reach the 60% total surface area goal, and to accomplish a 90% reduction in the 0-3 inch fuel loadings for these units. Four burn units are continuous and comprise approximately 6,000 acres located approximately 150º and 40 NM from Burns Municipal Airport (BNO).  The remaining 1,881 acres are composed of 24 units of various acreages, from 9 acres to 170 acres located approximately 90º and 20 NM from BNO.  Potential batch mixing sites have been identified that are accessed by paved roads and are within 10 miles from the burn units.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation FA8601-06-R-0023

1.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to questions received after the posting of the solicitation.

Question One: Does the chamber have two (2) doors - - or is it one (1) door with double o-rings?  The shroud diameter is specified at 36" diameter, but also states that it should be 51" diameter. With a maximum width of 55", the chamber would end up at over 61" taking into account the shroud mass, a clearance between the shroud and the chamber ID, the chamber wall and a door flange.  What I am saying is that the chamber width cannot be under 55" with a shroud diameter of 51".  Please clarify.

Answer:  It will be a double door design.  The shroud diameter has to be 51” to accommodate the 36” working space.

Question Two:  What are the two rectangular objects and the circle object in the drawing?  And where on the drawing is the Space Simulator to be installed?

Answer:  The round vacuum chamber will be removed and the space simulator will go on the right of the shaker table (rectangular objects).

Question Three:  My Company can provide some of the parts required.  Is a partial bid for these items acceptable?

Answer:  Quotes are being accepted on the complete unit.  

Question Four: Is this project set aside or small disadvantaged business or just 8(a)?

Answer:  Proposed acquisition is 100% set aside for small business concerns. Under FAR 19, Nonmanufacturer rule" means that a contractor under a small business set aside or 8(a) contract shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Small business link is http://sba.gov.   Responding parties must indicate their business size status in relation to the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 332313, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 3443 (size standard 500 employees).  Businesses providing quotes shall identify and address if they are a large, small, 8(a), woman owned, Hub zone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business in their responses.

Question Five: Please tell me how to obtain a copy of the above referenced solicitation. I followed the instructions to the PIXS website but it is not posted there and a search only brings up another copy of the synopsis.

Answer:  When I open PIXs, the documents are there.  Contact the Webmaster at PIXs for problems with the Website.

2.  As a result of this amendment, no changes are being made to the solicitation.  The closing date remains unchanged.  Quotes are due NLT 11:30 a.m. EST on Wednesday, 22 February 2006, to Ms Jacque Davis, 88 CONS/PKB, 1940 Allbrook Drive, Suite 3, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309.
