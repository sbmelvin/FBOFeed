<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for additional hardware and software that is completely compatible with the hardware and software currently used by the Structural Dynamics Test Branch to acquire and analyze modal test data.	The hardware includes (1) additional hardware modules (LMS Model V12-A) which are identical to modules currently used by the Structural Dynamics Test Branch and which can be interchanged with modules in existing Model 305, 316, and 317 Scadas mainframes, (2) upgraded source generation modules (LMS Model VDAC) which will allow controlled shutdown during sine testing and which are interchangeable with the current LMS QDAC source generation modules, (3) an 8-channel mobile Scadas which can be operated using existing software drivers, and (4) a portable workstation configured with all software, drivers, and interface hardware to operate both the new and existing LMS data acquisition systems.  The procurement will also provide a complete system verification/upgrade for all existing Scadas hardware.	The software provides for the migration of an existing UNIX-based LMS data acquisition system to the upgraded software running in a native Microsoft Windows environment.  The software allows the operation of the proprietary LMS data acquisition hardware and allows access to the raw/binary format of existing UNIX-based LMS project files as well as existing Windows-based LMS project files. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Leuven Mesurement Systems (LMS) North America. By acquiring the additional hardware and software from LMS, absolute compatibility with existing hardware and software is assured.  A substantial investment (&gt; $500K) by the government has already been made in existing LMS software and hardware, and replacing the current software and hardware would be impractical.  No other vendor can provide hardware and/or software which would be completely compatible with the existing LMS modal test equipment due to proprietary property rights of LMS.  LMS does not have any authorized distributors.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 28, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,Sensors Directorate (AFRL/PKSE)solicits research proposals to support  research and development effort shall design and implement an airborne Common Data Link (CDL) terminal for use in Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS).  Due to the payload restrictions of these systems, using present CDL equipment is prohibitive, and has contributed to the proliferation of platform specific data link systems.  This effort shall examine the size, weight, and power requirements for SUAS platforms, and develop a CDL terminal capable of providing these platforms with CDL capability, with the intent of reducing the need for further unique systems.  In addition, the Mini-CDL terminal shall be capable of communicating with existing ground systems which employ CDL terminals.  These objectives shall be accomplished by, first, developing a preliminary design, including an evaluation of trade space, identification of high risk areas, and a plan for mitigating these risks in the design.  Upon successful completion of a preliminary design, the system shall be implemented and demonstrated in a laboratory environment with hardware in-the-loop systems.  Finally, the terminal shall be flight tested to determine its ability to provide SUAS with the required CDL communications. Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunties(FEDBIZOPPS) homepage at http://www.fbo.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting points of contact identified in the announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS)
<SOLNBR>BAA06-44
<RESPDATE>111506
<ARCHDATE>08182007
<CONTACT>Mark  Rosker, MTO Program Manager, Phone 571-218-4507, Fax 705 696-2208, Email mrosker@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting research proposals in the area of COmpound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that  develop a viable process for the  fine-scale heterogeneous integration of CS with standard Si CMOS and to establish that this integration enables superior performance in specific mixed-signal circuit demonstrators.

The COSMOS process developed must be consistent with the integration of transistors from at least one CS semiconductor technology together with Si transistors. This integration should be achieved on a Si wafer (or substantial portion thereof; any size limits should be clearly stated in the proposal) which has been fabricated using a standard Si CMOS foundry process. No extraordinary process modifications (i.e., one that would not be transparent to a Si foundry) of the Si CMOS process should be required in order to achieve the integration.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

I.	Placement of CS Devices;
II.	Heterogeneous Interfaces;
III.	Dense Heterogeneous Interconnects;
IV.	Yield Enhancement;

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-44 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The COSMOS program will be conducted in three phases each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics. Each phase will culminate in a specified mixed-signal circuit demonstration which will serve to validate that the goals of the phase have been achieved. The period of performance for each of these phases and the milestone schedule will be proposed by offerors within their technical proposals and will be factors considered as part of the source selection process (see below). In general, a shorter phase is preferable, but each phase should clearly be adequate in duration to meet its objectives with reasonable risks and costs. Proposals should discuss plans for managing these factors. COSMOS program will consist of three phases (duration of each phase should be specified by proposers in the full proposal).  

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Mark Rosker, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-44@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on	
a noncompetitive basis with the Duke University for a project on demographic and psychosocial correlates of John Henryism.  Individual characteristics or traits that can help understand and possibly reduce the tremendous racial and socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes have been slow to emerge.  Much attention has focused on the John Henry (JH) construct.  However, JH construct has received only limited research attention and replicable findings have been slow to emerge.  To move this area of research along, it is of great interest to analyze John Henry scores from carefully characterized in terms of age, race and socioeconomic characteristics.  Such a collection of information accessible to Lab of  Personality and Cognition researchers would represent a research resource that would address important questions regarding the relative role of  psychosocial aspects in addition to age, education, race and other demographic characteristics.  In order to perform sophisticated and comprehensive analyses of the John Henry construct it is necessary (1) to have carefully validated data file of John Henry scores from this racially balanced cohort and (2) scores on depression hostility social support and family environment and social network.  The data set from this contract will significantly extend the traditional conceptualization and characterization of the JH measure.  JH is an important variable that may be critical to explaining the frequently observed but little understood SES gradient and racial differences in health outcomes.  This data set will be critical to our subsequent plans to conduct similar investigations of the JH construct in the HANDLS data set.  To our knowledge, there exists no other sample or data set in the world available that has measured individuals in the Durham, North Carolina area that contains a racially balanced sample with the life-span grouping of community participants who have been characterized with this particular battery of psychosocial measures.  At the present time no source other than Dr. Beverly Brummett of the Duke University Behavioral Medical Research Center can meet the requirements of this procurement.  To our knowledge, Dr. Brummett is the only source that has this data available.  A survey of the literature in this field shows that there are not other sources for this data.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on	
a noncompetitive basis with the National Academy of Sciences,  500 5th St., Washington, DC 20001 for a project involving follow-up contact of NAS-IOM WWII Twins Cohort.
In the latest twin mailing, almost 80% of twins were non-respondents, meaning that we did not hear from the twin or got a notice from the post office that our mailing address was incorrect.  For purposes of future follow-up, it is important that we know how many twins are currently alive and how many are contactable.  In order to find this out, we propose to study twin non-respondents to the personality study and attempt to obtain definitive vital status information and addresses.  We propose sending the records of all non-respondents with Social Security Number (SSN) to the National Death Index (NDI) to determine vital status.  We would then take a sample of N=200 twins not known to be dead in NDI to be thoroughly searched by commercial tracing firms.  The reason for sampling presumed living twins is that the per-twin cost for a thorough search will be relatively high.  Dr. William Page of NAS-NRC Medical Follow-up Agency is presently the only known source who is the custodian for this data and has the authority to submit SSN’s to the NDI.  A survey of the literature in this field shows that there are no other sources for these data.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on	
a noncompetitive basis with the University of Miami, P.O. Box 248185, Coral Gables, FL 33124 for a project on personality and spirituality in long-term survivors in AIDS.  Spirituality and religiosity are concepts central to many individuals’ lives, and in particular, for those individuals with long-term illness.  The role these concepts play in the lives of individuals with long-term illness is certainly of paramount importance to those individuals.  Our major aim is to empirically investigate how personality and spirituality affect disease progression.  Whether and how personality affects survival and disease trajectory of those living with AIDS is the major question this proposal seeks to answer.  These and other questions regarding the relationship between personality and spirituality are ones that has been virtually unexplored.  However, Dr. Gail Ironson of the University of Miami has amassed data on long-term survivors of AIDS, measures of personality, disease trajectory and spirituality.  Data on more than 100 AIDS patients who have been characterized in terms of personality and spirituality measures along with measures of CD4 and viral load are exceedingly rare.  Dr. Ironson is the only person known to us that has this data.  A survey of the literature in this field shows that there are no other sources for this data.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-06-. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price purchase order to SWE-DISH Satellite Systems, Inc., 12343 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite D, Reston, VA 20191-3417.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The Expeditionary Warfare Integration Facility (EWIF) has recently identified a need to integrate a satellite communications capability into the existing facility infrastructure.  This satellite capability will b!  e permanently mounted on the roof of Building 544 and will allow remote systems to communicate back to various systems already located in the EWIF.  Equipment that will be required to fulfill this requirement includes a Ku-band satellite dish with an integrated IP satellite modem, rugged housing, lightning protection, and cabling.  A dish size of at least 1.5m is required because it provides more gain, allows the user to transmit with more power, and thus allows for higher data rates than smaller sized dishes. This also allows the dish to support more than one remote user at any one time, which is integral to the planned usage of this terminal.  The dish must be able to withstand up to 120 mph winds when stowed and must be able to be remotely stowed for tropical storm or hurricane preparations.  Also, back lobe radiation levels emitted from the dish must be very low.  The system must meet applicable military standards and have the following approvals:  INTELSAT, EUTELSAT, a!  nd appropriate FCC licenses.  Extensive market research has shown that  the only product that satisfies all of the requirements above is the SWE-Dish DA 150K Drive-Away Pod Antenna System. The following is being procured: CLIN 0001:  SWE-DISH DA 150K Drive-Away Pod Antenna System comprised of:  the SWE-DISH 150K EDD vehicle mount pod antenna system for fixed vehicle integration, with 2 port linear polarized feed system covering Tx 13.75 to 14.50 GHz, Rx 10.95 to 12.75 GHz with Transmit Reject Filter and Optional Tx coverage from 12.75 GHz, optional 3-port feed,  the SWE-DISH ACU3000 antenna control unit, and the iDirect remote router unit that encompasses a satellite modem, IP router, TCP/HTTP Optimization over Satelllte, QoS/Prioritization, and Encryption in one box.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Laser Vibrometer System. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Polytec, Inc., on a sole source basis.  Polytec, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the Laser Vibrometer system.  The required scanning laser vibrometer system, manufactured by Polytec Laser Measurement Systems, is capable of measuring out-of-plane vibration and displacement with high sensitivity using laser illumination as a non-contact method.  The system will be used primarily as a vibration and displacement measurement tool for small, light weight test articles or extreme environment applications where mass-loading effects or survivability of an accelerometer prohibit their use. Polytec is the only company that provides a scanning laser vibrometer system capable of measuring dynamic displacements up to 40 KHz.  Current test requests and future test projections show that these out-of-plane displacement measurements are necessary for extreme environment applications.  MSFC’s existing scanning laser vibrometer system is almost 10 years old and only shows measurement instability above 1000 Hz.  Ometron, Inc., the manufacturer of the existing system, no longer manufactures scanning laser vibrometer systems or is capable of servicing it.	Market research revealed that Polytec is currently the only company that can provide this type of scanning laser system. Polytec is the only company with locations in the United States that can provide service agreements and timely admittance to the Redstone Arsenal for their system.  Prompt and timely onsite support through software and hardware maintenance agreements is of utmost importance. A company service representative is required to be onsite in a matter of a few days to resolve situations or problems with the system. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Elizabeth Mudler at Elizabeth.e.Mudler@nasa.gov or fax to 256-544-4401 no later than 3:00 p.m. CST September 01, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or no to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for ALTAIR Meteoroid Study. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the service from Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory on a sole source basis. MIT/Lincoln Lab has been operating/working under a DoD contract with the ALTAIR radar for many years and are intimately familiar with the system characteristics & operations.  Lincoln Labs possesses experts in the meteoroid area, and the combination of these two factors enabled the NASA Space Environments and Effects (SEE) program to produce the first extensive database of meteor bulk densities, which offers great assistance to spacecraft designers. Only Lincoln Lab has developed the analysis software needed to obtain meteoroid densities and orbits for the ALTAIR system.  Lincoln Lab has the experience in both the meteoroid arena and in ALTAIR operations, making them an essential and necessary part of this study.evaluation of radar capabilities has shown that the ALTAIR radar located on Kwajelein Atoll is the only radar capable of performing this work and providing the required high transmit power, rigorous calibration, and directional pointing ability.  These capabilities that only Lincoln Lab can provide are essential to successfully obtain radar observations of sporadic and shower meteoroids for the purpose of determining meteoroid masses, orbits, ballistic coefficients and densities, which shall be provided to the Meteroid Environment Office (MEO) at Marshall Space Flight Center.      The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Judith Drabkin at Judith.R.Drbkin@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m.CST August 25, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>HUD intends to conduct a public/private, full and open competition for HUD’s Integrated enterprise wide financial management system implementation and integration of the PeopleSoft Financial Management suite of products in support of HUD’s Integrated Financial Management Improvement Project (HIFMIP).  To assist us in accomplishing this objective, we have attached a draft solicitation and seek comments on or before September 5, 2006, from interested sources, which believe they are able to provide the support.  

The purpose of HIFMIP is to modernize HUD’s accounting and financial management functions by transitioning its core legacy systems to PeopleSoft Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) suite of financial management modules to produce an integrated turn-key system.   The end results will be the production of fully auditable financial statements throughout HUD, and potentially the Federal Housing Administration, Ginnie Mae, and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO).  This modernization will be accomplished by using the Government selected PeopleSoft Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) qualified and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) compliant turn-key system solution.  The primary goals are to maximize HUD’s ability to reduce disparate legacy systems and data, and establish an environment that provides all levels of leadership with reliable, relevant, and timely information on an enterprise-wide basis.  

We are soliciting written comments from potential offerors on our draft solicitation.  The draft solicitation will be posted on August 18, 2006, at the following web sites:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov  and http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract.cfm.  Responses should be sent by e-mail to: Jennifer_T._Johnson@HUD.gov  All interested sources that feel they would be interested in this draft solicitation and have comments on the document, are invited to submit comments on or before September 5, 2006

<DESC>THIS IS A COMPETITIVE SYNOPSIS WITH A SEPARATELY ISSUED SOLICITATION

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Review of NCI Thesaurus for OBO-Compliance and Training to Help NCI Achieve Compliance.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541512 and the business size standard is $23M.  

Introduction: The two major terminology products of the Electronic Vocabulary System (EVS) are the NCI Metathesaurus http://ncimeta.nic.nih.gov/ and the NCI Thesaurus http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/.  The tasks in the SOW are focused on the NCI Thesaurus.

NCI Thesaurus is a description logic concept based namespace that contains cancer-centric terminology.  It is primarily intended for use by applications to traverse vocabulary trees and the semantic relationships between and among concepts.  It provides the base semantics for NCI’s metadata infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR) and NCI’s data repository infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caBIO). In addition it is used by NCI to index the NCI’s Web portal site (see http://cancer.gov); by NIH to construct concept vectors used by the NIH knowledge management system; by the cancer Bioinformatics Grid (see http://caBIG.nci.nih.gov) to provide terminology for the various activities; and by numerous scientific applications, across a growing number of domains that increasingly extend beyond cancer.  NCI Thesaurus is published monthly by the NCI under an open content license (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/ThesaurusTermsofUse.pdf). 

Scope:  Four (4) general activities are within scope of this SOW.  The first activity is a review and report of OBO criteria and relevant ISO standards for semantic quality and federation of terminologies as well as identifying and defining a set of goal requirements for semantic quality and consistency.  The second is review of the content and semantic structure of a small specified subset of NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical terminology produced by the NCI, for compliance with relevant International Standards Organization (ISO) standards; and for compliance with standards related to qualification as an open terminology under OBO; and for compliance with design and semantics criteria for federation with other OBO terminologies. The third activity includes documenting several clear examples of the modeling that would be needed to achieve compliance; this activity could draw on the work conducted in the second activity.  And the fourth activity includes training several NCI designated Editors or Quality Assurance staff to finish reviewing and editing the NCI Thesaurus for compliance.

Period of Performance:  Anticipated, thirty eight (38) weeks after initial award.  Only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  Interested parties that wish to receive a copy of the solicitation must do so by the following:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   Request shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone and fax numbers, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ number RFQ-NCI-60100-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is August 2, 2006 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is August 3, 2006 and the estimated due date is August18, 2006. Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  No collect calls will be accepted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Stopped flow analysis of rapid reactions.

Purpose/Brief History:

The Section on Membrane Trafficking studies a family of proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the small G-protein Arf.  The current work is motivated by two critical findings.  First, two members of the family, ASAP1 and ASAP3, contribute to malignancy.  ASAP1 is a target of Src that is necessary for the formation of invadopodia in mammary carcinoma cells and has been identified as an oncogene in uveal melanoma.  ASAP3 has been found to contribute to the pathology of hepatocellular carcinoma.  Second, although at its many sites of action Arf is regulated by GAPs with similar primary structure, there are mechanistic differences among the GAPs revealed by mutagenesis of Arf.  In current studies in the laboratory, we will molecularly define the mechanistic differences so that they may be exploited therapeutically.  This work requires the ability to study single turnover kinetics and to examine individual steps within the reaction sequence.  A stopped flow instrument is the only tool currently available for studying reactions in the necessary time scales (1 msec – 10 sec) that allows for the monitoring of specific protein-protein, protein-lipid and GTP hydrolysis continuously in this time scale.  

The stopped-flow instrument  has the following features that are required for the LCO’s research:

1)	Motor Drive:  A computer-controlled servo motor drive to provide precise and reproducible mixing of 2 or 3 solutions.  The motor should be digitally controlled with 4096 counts per revolution with resolver feedback for precise positioning, have high torque, low inertia, brushless motor and high performance and a digital power supply to provide essentially instantaneous starts and stops of the drive syringes. 
2)	Syringe chamber and cell assembly:  The syringe/cell assembly should be easily removed for maintenance or for changing of cell types.  The syringe chamber is transparent and thermostatted by circulating water.  
3)	Valve position sensors:  Optical sensors to detect the load and fire positions of the sample load valve to prevent incorrect operation so as to preserve precious samples.  
4)	Light Source:  A water-cooled 150 watt Mercury-Xenon arc lamp with parabolic mirror, and computer-controlled monochromator to provide a maximum intensity, stable light source.  
5)	Optical fiber:  A quartz optical fiber bundle to bring light from the exit slit of the monochromator to the sample cell.  
6)	Detectors:  A UV-sensitive photomultiplier and a UV-enhanced for simultaneous measurement of fluorescence and absorbance and a second photomultiplier to simultaneous measure two wavelengths or for real time polarization anisotropy measurements.   
7)	Software:  Stopped-Flow system software that runs under Windows XP®, providing precise and complete computer control of data collection, analysis and printing and export of data to other PC programs for data analysis and presentation.  In addition software for computer simulation of complex kinetic processes and fitting of data directly to mechanism using nonlinear regression and global analysis to fit an entire data set to a single reaction pathway is required.  
8)	Dead Time: A dead time of less than 1 millisecond.  
9)	Sample Volumes: A reaction volume of 20 µl or less.  
10)	Data Collection and Analysis:  413 kHz 16 bit A/D converter to provide fast and accurate data collection.  
11)	Double Mixing Experiments: Ability to perform double mixing experiments. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The KinTek stopped-flow instrument is the only instrument that uses a servo motor, rather than a pneumatic drive or stepper motors, to drive mixing.  The motor is long lasting and gives very reproducible mixing times.  In addition the SF-2400 stopped-flow instrument is the only instrument that has these critical features that are required for the LCO’s research:  a) dead time of less than 1 ms;  b) the greatest sensitivity;  c) smallest sample size,  which is especially important when reagents are difficult and expensive to prepare; d) collection of up to 3 signals simultaneously;  e) Titration module;  and f) Shutter to minimize photobleaching.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Health Services and Economics Branch (HSEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Regents of the University of Minnesota, 200 Oak St SE, Suite 450, Minneapolis, MN  55455 to validate chemotherapy and radiation therapy dose information found in Medicare claims data.  Many researchers use Medicare data to study patterns of cancer care, particularly receipt of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These modalities are of particular importance because they are used for initial therapy as well as for treating recurrences.  Cancer-directed radiation provided in the first six months is collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) cancer registries and has been successfully validated in Medicare claims, but radiation therapy provided after that time is not collected by SEER and has not been validated from Medicare sources. Researchers using Medicare data are often appropriately cautious about using Medicare data for such purposes but are also frustrated at the number of relevant questions that could be answered using Medicare if it could be shown that the data are an accurate reflection of clinical care. Using treatment information from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) study medical record reviews and comparing it with information from Medicare claims data would allow for methods to be established to use Medicare data for in-depth study of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Once validated, these methods could be used to assess subsequent treatment of CanCORS patients as well as patients identified via SEER/Medicare. This methodological work would demonstrate feasibility for future studies of cancer care using administrative data in combination with other sources.  The objective of this study is to validate the use of Medicare claims for assessing radiation dosage, treatment delays and chemotherapy agent, along with dose, dose reduction and delay. The following questions will be answered: 1) What percentage of cases have information on radiotherapy (RT) use in both Medicare claims and charts?;  2) Do claims-based estimates of RT dose and duration, delays and complications match chart-based estimates?;  3) What percentage of cases have information on chemotherapy use in both Medicare claims and charts?; and 4) Do claims-based estimates of chemotherapy agent, dose and duration, delays, dose reductions and complications match chart-based estimates?  In addition, this project will provide technical assistance to the CanCORS Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC) to support the process of linking CanCORS and Medicare data and provide technical assistance to other researchers using linked CanCORS/Medicare data. This assistance will be in the form of direct consultation and through managing the CanCORS Medicare linkage working group.  The University of Minnesota School of Public Health with Dr. Beth Virnig, Ph.D., M.P.H. have the unique experience and background that combines understanding of methodologies appropriate for validating administrative/claims data against other information sources and knowledge of the CanCORS project.  With twelve years of experience using Medicare data they are nationally-recognized as Medicare data experts. They are a member of the CanCORS consortium, and Dr. Virnig was a member of the committee that designed the Medical Record Review Instrument.  The combination of Medicare expertise and CanCORS knowledge is unique and essential for carrying out the objectives described in this SOW.  This is the only known source to the NCI researcher that has the access to the data and the expertise to complete this validation.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 1, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The TRICARE Management Activity invites potential sources to provide an industry perspective to the TRICARE Overseas Program in order that the structure of the second generation of TRICARE Overseas Managed Care Support (MCS) contract may be developed to reflect best practices and innovative solutions to the many military health care challenges. Input and information may be provided in writing or through one-on-one meetings with the TRICARE Management Activity. One-on-one meetings are intended to allow full disclosure in an environment that protects any information shared. The one-on-one meetings will be held face-to-face at TRICARE Management Activity Offices in Aurora, Colorado; and will occur between September 18, and September 29, 2006. If you are interested in providing input into the future of the military health care system through the services provided under contracts for Managed Care Support, please contact Mr. Martin A. Martinez, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at martin.martinez@tma.osd.mil no later than 8 September, 2006, to make arrangements for a one-on-one meeting. If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, conference calls, or submission of written information will be considered.

Overview:	The Defense Health Program (DPH) consists of direct care provided by DoD personnel through Military Treatment Facilities (MTF), Dental Treatment Facilities (DTFs)  and clinics located  both in the continental United States and purchased care provided through Managed Care Support Contractors. In the overseas arena, direct care is provided to active duty service members and their family members at the MTFs, DTFs, and through contract support for remote and designated locations, to include Puerto Rico.  This overview is to describe the overseas purchased care portion of the DHP. Additional information is available on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. In order to fulfill the purchased care needs of the DHP, sources/contractors must provide all services necessary to fully support DoD’s primary wartime readiness mission while supplementing the services provided through DoD owned and/or operated health care facilities. Information from sources/contractors should address providing clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community, Puerto Rico, and/or U.S. standards and fulfilling the objectives complying with the scope and structure of TRICARE Program; i.e., benefits and beneficiary liabilities, including technical requirements specified under the TRICARE uniform health care benefit. Information must address the expertise of managed care organizations and health benefit administrators in incorporating and operating the best business model and practices of the private sector in support of DoD healthcare delivery. Any contractor selected for contract award will have to provide the DoD with clinical and administrative services that are comparable to the best offered in the host nation civilian community, Puerto Rico, and/or U.S. practices. Information is sought to assure that the services will be delivered in a manner that achieves a fully integrated health care delivery and financing system for the Active Duty (AD) and Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs) permanently stationed in remote overseas locations.

Current Status of the Defense Health Program (DHP):	The medical mission of the Department of Defense is to maintain readiness through health and medical services provided to the armed forces during military operations, and to provide health and medical services/support to the members of the armed forces, their family members and other entitled to DoD health care. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.

In support of its readiness mission, the MHS maintains a system of MTFs and clinics worldwide, that provide direct care to active duty personnel and to others who are eligible for military health benefits if space is available. Although the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years and will continue to do so under the transformation of the military, it remains important that MTFs are optimized where possible in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. Currently, the direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through the awarding of MCS contracts overseas, augments the direct care system through a host nation civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible active duty service members and their families.

MCS services apply to approximately 378,000 AD and ADFMs of the Uniformed Services overseas: the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marines Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, their spouses and children.
 
Currently, TRICARE provides two health care options for beneficiaries overseas: Prime and Standard. TRICARE Prime is similar to an Health Maintenance Organization with a Point of Service option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All AD personnel are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty healthcare. ADFMs who are command sponsored may elect to enroll into TRICARE Prime and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee or co-pays for care delivered in the Host Nation network or the direct care system. TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. TRICARE Standard is utilized by ADFMs who choose not to enroll in TRICARE Prime or are not command sponsored and by retirees who choose to live overseas and utilize their TRICARE benefit for health care.   TRICARE Extra is not offered overseas.  The two options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 CFR Part 199.17 and 199.18 which may be accessed on the TRICARE Management Activity World Wide Web site at www.tricare.osd.mil. 

Currently, TRICARE Prime enrollees receive all primary care from a Primary Care Manager (PCM), who may be located at the MTF or may be a civilian provider in the MCS provider network. The MCS contractor is responsible for providing eligible beneficiaries with other services such as network referrals, assistance in locating host nation providers for care, medical management, and beneficiary education. 

The MHS is organized into three TRICARE Regions overseas: TRICARE Area Office - Pacific (TAO-P); TRICARE Area Office - Latin America and Canada (TAO-LAC), and TRICARE Area Office - Europe (TAO-E). Currently, at a minimum, a MCS contractor is required to establish a TRICARE Prime network in designated remote overseas locations. 

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires delivery of a uniform health care benefit in the form of uniform healthcare quality, structure and patient cost-sharing. However, DoD is also interested in taking advantage of the expertise of the civilian sector and incorporate the best practices for the overseas environment.

Proposed Contract Performance Objectives:	A world-class health system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining and restoring health is our vision for fulfilling the MHS mission. To enhance DoD and our Nation’s security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care. As noted above, this is accomplished through an integrated health care delivery system consisting of our military hospitals and clinics, as well as services purchased in the civilian sector. The TRICARE Program is accomplishing this mission today through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC) that contains the following Contract Objectives. These Objectives are not listed by order of importance.

Objective 1:	In partnership with the Military Health System (MHS), optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system for all MHS beneficiaries.

Objective 2:	Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer friendly program services. Beneficiary must be highly satisfied with each and every service provided by the contractor during each and every contact.

Objective 3:	Attain best value health care services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.

Objective 4:	Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery. Minimal disruption to beneficiaries.

Objective 5:	Ready access to contractor maintained data to support the Department of Defenses (DoD) financial planning, health systems planning, medical resource management, clinical management, clinical research, and contract administration activities.

These Objectives are not unchangeable. Potential sources may have more contemporary information on the proper objectives for achieving our vision and mission while clearly focusing on measurable, high quality clinical and administrative services achieved in the most cost efficient manner for the American taxpayer. We are also very interested in the industry’s thoughts concerning performance requirements. Requirements in this setting represent performance that must occur at or exceed specified performance standards and that achieves outcome based objectives identified in a contract. Examples of the performance standards may be found in the TRICARE Operations Manual at www.tricare.mil. TMA is very interested in the industry’s assessment of the existing performance standards and suggestions for new, revised, and or completely changed performance standards. Performance standards information is desired for the following areas of interest that are being included in the contract.

1.	Networks: Access to Host Nation medical and dental network providers, and location of networks. Offerors are allowed to propose networks where cost-effective. What does industry suggest in relation to networks?  Should the contract include a requirement for the contractor to develop a pharmacy network or just provide pharmaceutical services to include facilitation of processing and paying pharmacy claims only? 

2.	Referral Management: Beneficiaries enrolled to the TRICARE Global Remote Overseas Contract and the Puerto Rico Contract Overseas currently can self refer for primary care as they reside in locations distant from an MTF and are not assigned a Host Nation provider as a PCM at present.  How would the the contractor  review and schedule routine specialty care appointments?  

3.	MTF Coordination: Currently, a pilot program is in Europe to establish and maintain inpatient healthcare networks around selected MTFs and provide inpatient case management to MTF enrollees admitted to host nation facilities, and to implement a process to review and standardize the outpatient network host nation provider credentials. Close coordination between those selected MTFs in Europe and the MCS is critical to provide seamless continuity of health care services as networks and referral management must continuously adjust to support the changes in MTF capability and capacity that occur daily as the result of war, contingency operations, national disasters, deployments, training, transfers, etc. TMA is interested in discussing the impact MTF operations have on contracts and the extent to which this impact affects costs, and network management.

4.	Medical Management: We define medical management as contemporary practices in areas such as network management, utilization management, case management, care coordination, disease management, assessment of clinical quality and various additional terms and models for managing the clinical and social needs of the beneficiary to achieve the short and long term cost-effectiveness of the MHS while achieving the highest level of satisfaction among MHS beneficiaries. What is the value of each of the named approaches and are there other opportunities to enhance the quality of care while ensuring the appropriate expenditure of tax dollars.

5.	Claims Processing: TRICARE currently processes 680,000 overseas claims a year.  How can TRICARE achieve efficiencies while complying with federal laws regarding the expenditure of Government dollars?  What practices are recommended to screen and put processes in place to prevent fraudulent billing?

6.	Customer Service: TRICARE provides customer services via telephone, e-mail, web based materials, on-site service centers at MTFs. Currently, enrollment of beneficiaries into the current contract is performed by contractor staff at each TRICARE Area Office vs. the contractor. Should the contractor perform a full range of customer services to include enrollment functions and on-site service centers? How would a commercial concern approach customer service?  Discuss telephone service availability to assist overseas members when back in the continental United States.

7.	Automated Data Processing: TRICARE has a number of unique data processing requirements including Department of Defense mandated security procedures and certifications, interfaces with DEERS to determine eligibility on-line, processing enrollments through Government systems, and submitting payment records in support of claims processing activities. Many of these requirements are not negotiable: however, we are interested in the impact of these requirements on cost and the level of interest in proposing on future contracts.

8.	Management Services: This is a broad category that includes staffing, quality management/quality improvement, reporting, responsiveness to change, provider education, and managing contractor operations to fulfill the Governments performance standards while achieving the Governments outcomes. What should the Government require in terms of management services, how should they be measured, and how should the Government monitor performance?

9.	Incentives:	What positive and negative incentives are used in the industry, if any, and how do they impact your operations and proposals? What incentives should be created that would help achieve the goals of TRICARE?

10.	IT Services:	Anything to consider with regards to HIPAA, DITSCAP network security and electronic communication overseas?

The Government is interested in any information potential sources would like to address in support of achieving high quality, cost effective delivery of health care services. Please remember there are legislative limitations and recommendations conflicting with statutes may not be able to be implemented. However, any of the administrative requirement changes which support a more efficient TRICARE Program may be acceptable for information presentation. The Regulations, TRICARE Operations Manual, TRICARE Policy Manual, TRICARE Systems Manual, and TRICARE Reimbursement Manual are all requirements of the TRICARE Program and uniform benefit. These are available for review at www.tricare.mil and may provide insight to potential sources.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The period of performance is one year, beginning upon award under existing Contract W9113M-05-C-0139, to which the instant effort will be added by modification.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the  requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDCM-AK/Koger.

<DESC>This notice serves as Amendment No. 02 to BAA06-17.  BAA06-17 remains open for one year from the date of initial posting on FedBizOpps (24 Jan 2006).  DARPA is publishing a revised Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers are required to use the revised PIP for all future submissions made against BAA06-17.  

October 2, 2006 at 4:00pm Eastern Time is hereby established as the deadline for a second round submission of proposals.  Proposers are required to submit proposals by this time to be considered in the second round of evaluations; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated for up to one year from the date of initial posting on  FedBizOpps and Grants.gov.  Proposals should be submitted in the manner delineated in the BAA and PIP, as revised by this amendment.  

Proposers who submitted proposals that were not selected during the first round of evaluation may submit new or amended proposals.  Submission of a proposal abstract is not necessary or encouraged for these Proposers.  It is suggested that these proposers request an informal debrief from the DARPA Program Manager, if not already completed, prior to submitting a new or amended proposal for the second round of evaluations. 

At this time, DARPA does not intend to make any awards based upon proposals submitted during the first round of evaluations; however, DARPA reserves the right to do so at a later date if considered in its best interest and in conformance with the original BAA and PIP.    

Accordingly, the original BAA notice is hereby revised as reflected below:  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of recognizing improvised explosive devices and reporting. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

DARPA places a high value on technically feasible approaches that can reach the stated end objectives of the RIEDAR program in no more than 40 months.

The ultimate vision for the Recognize IED and Report (RIEDAR) program is to demonstrate a compact, robust, practical system for the remote detection of IEDs using their chemical vapor signatures and to demonstrate the ability of this system to operate from a moving vehicle with a high probability of detection of the IED and a low false positive rate.  The purpose of the revised BAA is to focus the program on specific component development (e.g. lasers, spectrometers, optical elements, etc) required to successfully achieve the end objectives of the program.  This change in emphasis is to ensure that all of the components required for meeting the program goals are developed up front and not later in the program.  Offerors are encouraged to use existing experimental data and/or theoretical calculations/modeling/simulation to determine the appropriate component specific metrics. If multiple technologies are proposed, then specific component requirements and component development plans for each of the proposed technologies should be described in detail.  The end objectives of the RIEDAR program are listed below:   

	(1) Standoff detection distance of 400 meters.
(2) Detection time of 1 second or less.
(3)  Area search rate capability of 2700 square meters per second (to search a road 100 meters wide and a meter in the travel direction from a vehicle moving at 60 mph).
(4) A false positive rate, P (false positive) of less than or equal to 1E-6.
(5) Overall size of the system should be less than 1 meter cubed, not including the power source, but including control electronics and any required device packaging.
Offerors should provide the following information:
•	Details of component development that will be necessary to meet these program objectives for each detection technique proposed.
•	Details of the timelines and metrics for each component for each detection technique proposed.  This information needs to be presented in clearly defined phases with interim component development metrics that provide a technically feasible path to meet the overall program objectives.
•	A detailed description of the necessary component technologies that need to be developed, how they will enable the program to meet the objectives and whether the components are commercially available and/or why the proposed components need to be developed.
•	A list of all the major commercially available components that will be integrated with the developed components.  Please provide detailed integration plan, metrics and timelines.
•	Go/No-Go component development metrics and milestones at self-defined time intervals to allow periodic program review of component development metrics and performance for Go/No-Go decision points.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals to address the following:  The offerors can provide a proposal for all of the technical areas or individual technical areas.

I.  Technical Area One: Direct Optical Standoff Explosive Vapor Detection Technique(s) Development.   This area of the program will focus on the development of optical technologies to increase standoff distance without compromising signal-to-noise ratio.  The primary means of detection in the RIEDAR program is limited to direct optical approaches such as, but not limited to Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman-Based Spectroscopies.  Technologies that integrate two or more of these sensing and detection techniques into an orthogonal based detection system are also of interest.  Techniques that require the pre-dispersal of sensors or materials in the targeted area are not encouraged.  Techniques that detect electronics or electronics on standby, detect metal or metallic objects, or are used as a non-chemical based cueing technique are not of interest in this program as a primary means of detection.  These techniques may be complementary to the detection of explosives but should not be the primary means of detection.  Methods that “jam” electronics or provide wide area neutralization are not part of this program.   Offerors should provide a detailed component development plan for each technique proposed, detailed descriptions regarding the choice of a particular detection scheme, the technical concepts and details of the detection scheme(s), and the overall system technology (power requirements, cooling, systems engineering, etc) roadmap to meet the program objectives.  

II.  Technical Area Two:  Increasing Signal-to-Noise Ratio.  This area of the program will focus on the development of novel component development to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of detected chemical signatures by the optical methods proposed.   The signal-to-noise ratio is significantly reduced not only by increasing standoff distance but also by limiting the time available for scanning the target area.  Hence, novel signal-enhancement component development is required to compensate for the orders of magnitude reduction in signal-to-noise ratio relative to that required for laboratory experiments.   Offerors should provide detailed component development plans to enable signal-to-noise ratio enhancement schemes, and proof of concept data if applicable. 

III.  Technical Area Three: Operationally-Relevant Parameters. This area of the program will be centered on the development of operationally-relevant components and technologies that can be incorporated with the chosen optical detection scheme(s) proposed.  Offerors should provide technical details of how the proposed component development needs can be operated with eye-safe lasers (the wavelength(s) of operation, the power needed in Watts per square meter), and schemes that allow scanning a 100 meter wide road while moving at 60 mph.
 
Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-17 revised Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Recognize IED and Report (RIEDAR) program will consist of a Phased component development effort to meet the overall program objectives as stated above.  Each proposer should provide a timeline and component development metrics for each Phase that map to the component development tasks necessary to meet the overall program objectives. Each offeror is encouraged to develop a compressed but technically feasible timeline based on component development to meet the program objectives. Offerors should provide a budget for each Phase of their program with later Phases being included as options in their proposal. Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-17 -has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Devanand K. Shenoy, fax:  (703) 248-1864, electronic mail: Devanand.Shenoy@darpa.mil.

Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the Recognize IED and Report program. 
Offerors should note that the effort will be subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions as well as other export control laws and it is expected that portions of those efforts that continue into later Phase Options will be classified.  Offerors are also expected to explain how ITAR and classified contracts will be handled.  The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.  Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Offerors choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this revised BAA.  An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.  For instructions on submitting classified abstracts or full proposals contact: Robert Copeland, Director, Security & Intelligence Directorate (703) 526-6631.  In all correspondence, reference BAA 06-17.  

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this revised BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-17.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the revised Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost reasonableness and realism.  Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered, including the potential contributions of the proposed work to the overall research program and the availability of funding for the effort.  Awards may be made to any offeror whose proposal is determined selectable regardless of its overall rating.

The administrative addresses for this BAA are:

Fax:  (703) 696-2206 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 06-17),

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, intends to negotiate with the Logical Technical Services (LTS) Corporation under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), for a modification to the work under Contract No. HHSN266200500006C, awarded as a small business set-aside for the period of 03/01/2005 through 02/28/2010. The negotiated modification will cover a period of 45 months.  The proposed modification will accommodate moving LTS staff, as well as other contractor personnel from NIAID space to adjoining space within the same building.  The new space will not only house personnel, but will also provide space for service to systems and equipment which are utilized in performance of the contract, and, will also be used for data center consolidation (currently performed under the contract) and an information technology data center (also currently performed under the contract).  The nature of the work requires contractor staff to interact with NIAID personnel and NIAID owned IT equipment continuously throughout the day and the adjacent space is considered essential.  The leased space will require networking/cabling refurbishment to accommodate computers, copiers and office equipment.  The proposed modification to provide the additional leased space is necessary as the NIAID space is at capacity and can no longer effectively house contractor personnel.  It is not anticipated that another contractor could provide adjacent space to NIAID for the purpose of providing facilities for existing NIAID contract staff, equipment, and work product.  If the proposed modification were to be awarded to another contractor at this time, the consequential interruption in the operation of the Division of Extramural Activities would result in unacceptable delays.  Therefore, LTS Corporation is uniquely qualified to continue to fulfill these requirements by virtue of their performance on the current contract and no other services will satisfy Agency requirements.  Offerors who submit capability statements must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without undue interruption to the support currently being provided to the NIAID and without unnecessary duplication of cost and effort.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  See Government-wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Modification 4

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 06-07-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 18 Sep 06; and FY 08 by 1 Jun 07. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 07, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The objective of the Commander's Predictive Environment (CPE) program is to provide a decision support environment that enables the Joint Force Commander / Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFC/JFACC) to better anticipate and shape the future battlespace. Key objectives of CPE are to design, build, test, integrate, and evaluate tools to support and enhance the Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (JIPB) and Joint Air Estimate Process (JAEP) processes.

Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is soliciting white papers for developing innovative and critical technologies necessary to make the CPE capability viable. White papers are sought addressing any or all of the following four areas:

    1. Defining and Understanding the Operational Environment.

    2. Course of Action Development, Analysis, Comparison, and Selection.

    3. Forecasting and Predictive Planning.

    4. Experimentation and Evaluation.

1. Defining and Understanding the Operational Environment: 

To assist in understanding the operation environment, a System-of-Systems Analysis (SoSA) is employed, treating the battlespace as an interrelated system across Political, Military, Economic, Social, Information, and Infrastructure (PMESII) dimensions. This process attempts to 1) Model and analyze adversaries, self, and neutrals as a complex adaptive system; 2) Understand key relationships, dependencies, and vulnerabilities of adversary/self/neutrals; and 3) Identify leverage points that represent opportunities to influence capabilities, perceptions, decision making, and behavior.  The objective is to develop computer-based modeling and simulation capabilities that describe and project the complex dynamics of the operational environment (across PMESII dimensions) to better understand adversary/neutrals/self strengths, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and critical gaps. Technology needs include behavior models, model integration frameworks, and model development environments.

Behavior Signatures: AFRL is interested in developing behavior signatures which can be thought of as schemas or frames whose attributes delineate a set and arrangement of entity characteristics and patterns of activity that define the behavior of potential threat entities.  The entity may be individuals, groups, organizations, societies, and/or nations/states.  The behavior signatures are envisioned as being dynamic, active monitors drawing upon multiple streams of intelligence data, possibly over long temporal durations, to provide direct and indirect indicators, or "fingerprints", of activities of interest. Behavior signatures can be developed from focused knowledge about the identity of interest; they will define the entities methods of operations.  Research is needed to define signature libraries; develop analytic methodologies for assessing adversaries; provide a sensemaking support environment for the creation, interpretation, and exploitation of signatures and models; explore what type of architecture would be required to instantiate behavior signatures as a computational system; and identify which air force systems would benefit most from behavior signatures technology.

Model Frameworks and Development Environments: PMESII model development is currently a time-consuming activity. Skilled analysts build detailed, narrowly focused models that typically serve a single purpose. While useful, the current process is too slow, doesn't readily adapt to changes, and does not encompass the entire battlespace. The future operational need is for a capability that enables rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration and interoperability, and model maintenance. Significant effort has been undertaken to develop individual PMESII models. The key challenge is on technologies for rapid model development, rapid model adaptation, model integration/interoperability, and model maintenance; rather than individual PMESII model development. The objective here is to develop and demonstrate technologies to: 1) Facilitate PMESII model development, adaptation, and maintenance, 2) Integrate and/or make interoperable heterogeneous PMESII models, and 3) Leverage proven software engineering concepts such as standards, APIs, interfaces, etc.  The vision of this research is a "PMESII Model Framework and Development Environment" that is analogous to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for software development. Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches, as well as applied research capabilities, are sought. The goal of this effort will be to develop technologies that support an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for PMESII model development and maintenance. Such technologies include editors/browsers/inspectors, debuggers, version control, hierarchy diagrams, visual development, common model APIs and interfaces, interoperable data and model schema (ontologies), knowledge elicitation, model producer and consumer GUIs, and model reuse. The IDE should be capable of handling heterogeneous modeling frameworks while preserving their underlying formalisms. For example Markov Decision Process might be connected to an Adaptive Neural Net. The logic associated with each should be preserved. Also to be addressed are model scalability, dynamically multi-resolution models and resolution requirements, model abstraction techniques, model validation and verification, mapping of PMESII attributes to Diplomatic Infrastructure Military and Economic (DIME) actions and the predictive capability of the models, dynamic update of schema data/trends and learning/updating relationships amongst attributes. Solutions are also sought for interoperability between "soft social" and "hard infrastructure" models. All modeling techniques and technologies are of interest (e.g. System dynamics, Fuzzy Network, Associative Memories, Topic Trees, etc.). Of particular interest are new and innovative approaches for PMESII element modeling and interactions.

2. Course of Action (COA) Development, Analysis, Comparison, and Selection: This area of the BAA addresses innovative capabilities to provide automated support to the Joint Air Estimate Process (JAEP).  The Joint Air Estimate Process is a six-phase process that culminates with the production of the joint air operations plan (Joint Publication 3-30, "Command and Control for Joint Air Operations, dtd 5 Jun 2003):

    Mission Analysis

    Situation and Course of Action (COA) Development

    COA Analysis

    COA Comparison

    COA Selection

    Joint Air Operations Plan Development

During this process, the full range of probable and likely adversary and friendly COAs and Centers Of Gravity (COG) are analyzed.  Multiple COAs or one COA with significant branches and sequels are developed.  Actions are then wargamed to compare each candidate COA against predetermined criteria.   Within this context, topics of interest include but are not limited to:  COA representation, COA development, continuous-update and refinement, COA v. COA wargaming (beyond simple attrition-based analysis), COA sensitivity analysis, COA comparison, COA evaluation criteria development and management, COA trade-off analysis, explanation and drill-down, visualization, coordination/collaboration throughout the process, and JIPB support to COA analysis and development. 


3. Forecasting and Predictive Planning

A key aspect of the CPE vision is the ability to project plausible and likely "future states" with greater accuracy, completeness, and consistency than can be done today using means that often rely heavily on human intuition.  The objective is to offer senior decision makers (i.e., JFC, JFACC, and senior staff) greater insight, that will enable them to more effectively mitigate risk, prepare them to anticipate and seize opportunities, and to proactively shape the future to their advantage.

The ability to forecast "futures" and predicatively plan includes all phases in the JAEP, and may range from hours to days to weeks ahead and beyond.  This area of the BAA addresses the need for innovative approaches and technologies that will improve upon our ability to forecast and predict events and the future state of affairs in support of the JAEP.  The challenge the decision makers face is an environment that is highly complex, interdependent, and fraught with uncertainty; where the nth-order cascading effects of actions taken today are difficult to foresee.  Topics sought include but are not limited to: modeling and simulation, statistical methods, and predictive markets.


4. Experimentation and Evaluation

Implicit in the CPE project's aim to improve decision support, is the capability to objectively determine the ameliorative effect (or deleterious effect), of CPE-originated interventions upon decision making.  Currently, the capability to objectively measure performance and to assess the significance of changes in performance is neither well defined nor well implemented.  In particular, there is a need to establish an objective measurement and assessment scheme suitable for use in the laboratory, in the operational environment, and in the training environment.

This announcement solicits unique and innovative research and development in the area of establishing an objective performance measurement and assessment model for strategic planning, with a particular focus on the Air Operations Center (AOC) Strategy Division (SD).   Topics offered should be applicable both to generic (e.g., training or experimental) AOCs and to specific (currently operational) AOCs which may have ad hoc structures and processes in place.

<CONTACT>Christy L. Tarantini, 256-842-7514
<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer contractors' questions. Question: 1.Are you looking for the capabilities of Teams in the responses to the sources sought or the capabilities of individual companies?  2.	What is the estimated value of this new requirement?  3.	Can you give some examples of the Redstone customers?  4.	Throughout the synopsis is the statement They provide management and planning in support to the other service support programs (SSPs) within this service, which indicates these functions are being performed now.  Please clarify whether these functions a re currently being performed by government or contractor personnel? Answer: 1.  The approach the responders utilize for the market research is their determination. 2.  There is no current requirement. 3.  No examples are available at this time. 4.  Some of the functions described in the Sources Sought Notice have or are currently being performed by both Government and contractor personnel. Question: 1.       Are elements of the work described in the Sources Sought currently being provided to the Redstone Garrison under the ITSS contract? 2.       If the elements of work are similar or the same, is it the intent of AMCOM Base Operations to move these IT services being provided under the ITSS contract to another contract vehicle? 3.       If the elements referenced above are the same or similar, in keeping with the Armys plan for a single DOIM to provide common services, would it not better serve AMCOM and DOD resources to move the ITSS contract from the CIO/G6 to the Garrison ins tead of going through the expense and risk of another procurement?  Answer: 1. Some of the functions described in the Sources Sought Notice are similar to or the same as those in the ITSS contract. 2. It is no intent of the Sources Sought Notice at this time. 3. It is no intent of the Sources Sought Notice at this time. Question: 1) Depending on the outcome of the A-76 study, do you envision that all, or only part, of the activities listed will be outsourced to a contractor for execution?         2) Understanding that if the study reveals that it is in the best interests of the government to outsource some portion of the work, will activities such as records management and the storage of paper documents remain a government function due to t he potential proprietary nature of those requirements?         3) Again, assuming that the study reveals outsourcing some or all of the functions to be in the best interests of the government, will the government consider setting up an industrial account fund so that once resources are identified for a fiscal year, they will be protected for that year and not subject to realignments and redistributions? Answer: Regarding all three questions, this is a Sources Sought Notice for market research only.  No A-76 study was mentioned in this notice.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to lease space using other than full and open competition (Succeeding Lease). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) intends to negotiate and award a succeeding lease that is expiring in Riverton, Wyoming for approximately 3,635 square feet of office, laboratory, and warehouse space with an additional 3500 square feet of secured/fenced ware yard adjacent to the building.  Costs are not expected to be recovered through full and open competition, although the government will consider relocation if economic and other factors determine an alternative space to be advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, USGS will consider costs including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and network cabling costs), tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent), anticipated rent for the space, and any agency special requirements such as laboratory construction. Requests for Proposal are not available.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. If you desire to submit a location for evaluation, expressions of interest must be submitted in writing no later than August 30, 2006 and should include the following: Address/location of site, square footage, name, address and phone number of individual to be contacted, name of recorded owner, and evidence of authority to represent the owner as necessary.

<DESC>The Federal Government is seeking information regarding potential sources of supply for Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) (or “managed services”) for wireless products and services.  This is a market research effort being conducted in order to determine industry capabilities and industry robustness.  This is neither a procurement announcement nor a guarantee that a procurement will be conducted in the future.  A solicitation is not available at this time. Additionally, there is no guarantee or commitment by the Federal Government that a solicitation will be created as a result of this announcement. Any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. If you would like to be emailed an electronic version of this announcement in MS Word format, please send a request to the contracting officer listed below.

The Government values Industry input.  Accordingly, responses to this announcement are greatly appreciated.

Executive Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum on May 20, 2005, entitled “Implementing Strategic Sourcing” mandating that federal agencies leverage spending as much as possible. (see www.caoc.gov)
	
On November 16, 2005, the General Services Administration and the Department of Treasury launched the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI).  The purpose of the initiative is to: (1) Test the ability to strategically source across federal agencies; (2) Share best practices and build the strategic sourcing community of practice; (3) Learn lessons applicable to future strategic sourcing efforts at the federal or agency levels; (4) Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in responding to the OMB Strategic Sourcing Initiative.

FSSI is chartered under the purview of the Chief Acquisition Officer’s Council and the Strategic Sourcing Working Group, both of which are monitored by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy within OMB.  The Wireless Handheld Devices and Services commodity team (one of five under FSSI) includes representation from at least fourteen (14) federal departments and/or agencies, all of whom have agreed through a formal project charter to participate in the pilot in some capacity.

The primary objectives of the Wireless commodity team are to: (1) Establish a common procurement vehicle through which all Government agencies may procure and utilize wireless services; (2) Lower the total costs associated with wireless services while maintaining industry service levels; and (3) Utilize business intelligence to better support overall decision making and performance management.  

Purpose

The purpose of this Sources Sought (SS) is to gather sufficient information to assist in the decision making process of how to fulfill the Government's requirement to establish a common contracting arrangement to maintain agency information technology wireless programs to include, but not limited to, the acquisition of cellular devices [i.e. Cellular Phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Blackberries, and Cellular Network Cards], cellular services, and the management of program requirements. It is contemplated that the scope of the contracting arrangement (should one be created) would cover ALL Government agencies.

FSSI Team:

The team assembled to accomplish this OMB directive consists of fourteen agencies with an estimated 200,000 wireless devices.  The number of Government wide devices that may require service is unknown, but substantial.  The Government makes no guarantee regarding the number of devices that may require services in the future.  

Requirements:

If a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that it would require future Offerors to be able to propose a full managed services solution that supports procurement of wireless devices and services (local, regional, nationwide and International) through deployment, transfer, collection, engineering, management, operation, and disposal of wireless voice and data services for the Government.  A potential Offeror would likely be required to provide all program management services and support to the Government in administrating its programs.

The Government would require the flexibility to purchase or lease wireless services and equipment and pay only for actual minutes used for in-service/activated cellular devices.  

Additionally, if a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that the procurement would be conducted as a small business set aside if market research indicates that a sufficient industry base exists.

REQUESTED INFORMATION:

Please note, responses to these questions will not be treated as a proposal.  Responses to this request shall be treated as market research and market research only.

1.	Please identify your company name, location, number of employees, small business size status, and contact information for at least two individuals within your company.

14.	Please indicate how many total devices you feel you could manage with your current staffing levels.
15.	Please describe your quality assurance surveillance plan for ensuring that billings to the customer are accurate.  Please indicate whether clients are or can be provided with individual call information.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

This is a sources sought synopsis.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of commercial and public entities available to provide the NRC with the services  described below and to assess their capabilities.  The purpose of this request for information is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI).  For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html ).  All interested parties, including small business/small disadvantaged businesses and other Federal entities, are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below.  Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures, CDs, or videos is discouraged.  Responses are due no later than September nn, 2006.

INTRODUCTION.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent regulatory agency tasked with the mission to regulate and license the Nation=s civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment.  The NRC=s enacted budget authority for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 was $742 million and 3,294 FTEs.  The NRC collects approximately 90% of its budget, less the portion funded from the Nuclear Waste Fund and other designated exceptions, in annual and service fees charged to NRC licensees.  Total estimated fee collections in FY 2006 are anticipated to be approximately $625 million.  The NRC budget and staffing levels are anticipated to grow in the next few years due to the expected growth in new reactor license applications.  The NRC=s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is responsible for the financial stewardship of the NRC including the management of financial systems used in the course of official financial business.  

BACKGROUND.  The NRC currently uses a Federal shared service provider (SSP) as the information technology (IT) host and provider of the NRC=s core financial system, the Federal Financial System (FFS).  This SSP has over 30 years experience successfully servicing administrative systems for over 150 Federal government agencies.  FFS is the centerpiece of the NRC financial systems architecture.  FFS is a mainframe-based legacy system that the NRC implemented in October 1992 to perform the core financial function for the NRC.  Although implemented by the NRC in 1992, FFS was developed more than 20 years ago and is now nearing the end of its extended life cycle.  In addition to FFS, the same Federal SSP currently hosts the NRC payroll and human resources system and the NRC e-Travel System.  Moreover, the supporting infrastructure including communications links, interfaces, continuity planning,  and security are well-established and shared by these applications. 

 
The Federal SSP notified all customer agencies in a March 30, 2006, letter, that the corporate owner of FFS, CGI-AMS, has advised the SSP that FFS is no longer compliant with Federal standards for financial management systems and that they have discontinued any upgrades or enhancements to this system.  Therefore, the SSP further advised that they will no longer provide services on FFS effective with the beginning of FY 2011, starting on October 1, 2010.  As a result, the NRC must replace its legacy core financial system, FFS, with a modern solution.  The NRC is planning to target an implementation date of October 1, 2009.  Thus, the NRC is conducting market research to survey the availability of capable hosts, from the commercial and public sectors, of financial systems applications and the specific core financial applications they offer.  We are also researching the capability of these same hosts to host Federal payroll, time and labor (T&L), human resources, eTravel, and acquisition/ procurement systems.
 
The chart in Exhibit A lists the current NRC inventory of financial systems.  The systems are operational unless otherwise noted as under development.  All of the systems listed in Exhibit A have a direct or indirect interface with the FFS and would be interfaced with a new core financial system or may be subsumed by the functionality of the new core.  

REQUIREMENTS.  The NRC is seeking information from entities on their capability to provide the following products: (a) core financial system software; (b) payroll system software for Federal payroll and benefits; ( c ) human resources software for Federal human resources processing; (d) eTravel software for Federal travel; and, for possible future implementation, (e) the NRC is seeking information on the entity=s capability to provide acquisition/ procurement system software fully integrated with the core financial system.  In addition, the NRC is seeking information from entities on their capability to provide the following services: (a) financial systems software implementation and integration services; (b) hosting services for all of the financial systems products listed above at the entity=s facility on appropriate hardware (the electronic hardware environment) that is operated, maintained and upgraded when necessary by the host entity (not NRC); and, ( c) hosting services for NRC-provided time and labor (T&L) software.  The NRC is seeking information from a single entity and single NRC contact that can provide all of the software and services listed above with a seamless, transparent interface for the NRC and its user community.

The NRC seeks a viable replacement of the FFS with a modern, web-based, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) core financial system.  The system must be certified by the Federal Systems Integration Office (FSIO) as compliant with all current Federal core financial system requirements and security standards.  The system must have proven years of full implementation in service at a Federal agency of at least the (budgetary/FTE) size of the NRC, or larger.  The NRC has determined that two core products currently meet this criteria and limits the request for information to those entities that can provide either: (1) CGI-AMS= Momentum and/or, (2) Oracle Federal Financials.

The NRC seeks information from providers of IT hosting services capable of hosting one or both of these core financial system products.  Initially, the NRC also seeks to have the same hosting entity for Federal payroll, human resources, and eTravel.  Subsequently, the NRC seeks to have the same hosting entity for acquisition/procurement system and, time and labor (T&L).  The NRC seeks to establish a seamless architecture across financial systems by keeping financial systems hosted under a single provider to the extent possible.  The NRC seeks to avoid duplicate infrastructure costs for multiple hosts and reduce cost by foregoing the need to build multiple, remote interfaces among separate providers.  It will also eliminate the need for NRC to manage multiple hosting entities.

 
The NRC seeks information on a host entity=s capabilities and experience to implement and integrate new financial systems, interface with other financial systems, and convert historical data.  NRC also anticipates the functionality contained in a modern core financial system product may subsume the functionality of some currently separate existing financial systems, thereby allowing the retirement of some as separate system(s).  The NRC seeks information on a host contractor=s capability to provide services to analyze agency business processes and provide recommendations where efficiencies can be achieved as they relate to implementation of a new core financial system. 

With financial systems, the NRC embraces the integrated architectural concept expressed by the Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) Model in the Core Financial System Requirements publication.  From an architectural standpoint, the NRC wants to achieve a seamless and uniformly managed integration across all agency financial systems.  We also want seamless access and uninterrupted availability of financial data to our end users including managers.  We want to take advantage of an efficient architecture to improve our management of NRC resources by improving the delivery and timeliness of financial information to end users including managers.  Improvement of financial information to end users, along with expanding the types of financial system user (e.g., direct input by project managers, etc.) is a key goal.  We anticipate an expanded internal user base across all systems to be more than 3,000 users at various levels.

The NRC is seeking information on the security applicable to a host contractor=s facility and its compliance with all current Federal security standards and whether there is a well-designed, robust business continuity plan.   Additionally, the NRC seeks information from providers of IT hosting services of whether they have achieved full certification and accreditation (C&A) by a Federal agency and have authority to operate (ATO) a core financial and/or other financial system(s) for a Federal agency.  Finally, the NRC is seeking information concerning an independent auditor=s review of operating controls in place in your processing environment in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70 and the opinion expressed in the resultant report.

QUESTIONS.  The NRC is seeking information on the availability of commercial and Federal shared service providers (SSP) to support our IT requirements and provide assistance and support for transition from our legacy financial systems.  In order to perform our analysis, please provide answers the following questions:

<DESC>***********MARKET SURVEY*************

THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  RESPONSES TO THIS MARKET SURVEY SHALL BE FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, WHICH WILL BE USED TO ASSIST THE NIH IN DETERMINING IF QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AVAILABLE TO WARRANT SETTING ASIDE A PORTION OF THIS ACQUISITION FOR SMALL BUSINESS.


The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the availability of Small Businesses including certified 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns capable of performing Minor Renovations at NIH facilities as listed below. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 (Commercial and Industrial Building Construction) and the small business size is $31 million.  If it is determined that enough qualified small businesses exist to perform the work under this requirement, a portion of the acquisition (4 contracts/50%) will be set-aside for small business participation.  Additionally, task orders estimated-not-to-exceed $500,000 will be set-aside for fair opportunity consideration among the small-business contractors.

BACKGROUND:  The NIH main campus is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  As part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, NIH is the Federal Government’s primary biomedical research agency.  Within NIH, the following are some of the locations/facilities where task orders under the awarded contracts may be performed:

1) NIH Main Campus, Bethesda, Maryland (306 acres, 60 buildings, over 5.5 million square feet of space
2) NIH Animal Center, Poolesville, Maryland (500 acres, 188,000 square feet of floor space)
3) Gerontology Research Center (GRC), Baltimore, Maryland (7.5 acres)
4) Rental Facilities in Bethesda, Rockville and Gaithersburg, Maryland.

The NIH currently has a single indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type (IDIQ) contract in place which will expire within six months, and which will be replaced with this multiple-award acquisition. Based on historical information pertaining to the current contract, the cumulative average annual task order award (base year + 4 option years) thru August 2006 is approximately $18.1 million, ranging from $11.2 million per year to $33.2 Million per year. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:   The NIH anticipates awarding eight (8) fixed-price indefinite delivery (indefinite quantity type) contracts under a single solicitation utilizing a task order mechanism.  Each contract will be awarded for a base year with four (4) successive one-year option periods with a cumulative maximum not-to-exceed dollar amount of $150 million (Base plus four (4) Option Years).  Individual task orders may range from $25,000 to several million dollars. 

The NIH seeks highly qualified contractors with the capability to perform this contract, which will include various, simultaneous task orders. The Government anticipates awarding this multiple award contract to eight contractors – four large businesses and four small businesses (including Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, 8(a) and HUB Zone Small Businesses).  Task orders under this contract, which are estimated not to exceed $500,000.00, shall be automatically set-aside to be competed among small businesses.  Task Orders estimated to exceed $500,000 shall be competed among large and small businesses (if small businesses desire to compete). The Government reserves the right to allow large business to compete for task orders estimated not-to-exceed $500,000, when a fair opportunity to be considered for a task order of that magnitude results in no small business being determined capable of performing that specific requirement.  

After award of the multi-award contract, teaming arrangements are encouraged among multi-awardees, between large and small businesses, to fulfill a task.  Small businesses are encouraged to team with other multi-award large or small businesses to compete on task orders which might be beyond the small business’ capacity to perform.

The selected contractors shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, materials, equipment, transportation, and management necessary or incidental to provide planning, construction, repair and alterations for NIH, and must exhibit demonstrated experience, capability and resources in projects of comparable size and complexity, with comparable clients, and most significantly, with a demonstrated track record of performing such projects with a high degree of customer satisfaction.  The selected contractors shall be responsible for, and capable of, performing all associated demolition, removal of hazardous material, and construction of projects.  The selected contractors shall be capable of controlling dust and flying debris, and protecting all adjacent areas as the work area will be occupied is most instances.  All offerors submitting a proposal must be fully qualified and licensed and have qualified subcontractors (as applicable) for asbestos and hazardous waste abatement; be capable of supporting a field office as required by specific project at NIH Bethesda Campus.  Failure to meet these qualifications may result in a determination of technical unacceptability. Utility shutdown once scheduled must be strictly adhered to as continuity of utilities is imperative.  Projects may include, but are not limited to the following areas:

1)  Renovation of clinical and patient care units and all related areas to include general and specialized hospital spaces, including surgical areas.
2) Renovation of laboratory spaces and all associated support areas.
3) Renovation of animal spaces and all associated support areas.  These areas will be designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) Requirements.
4) Renovation of office, administrative, public and all associated support areas.
5) Replacement, repair and relocation of both interior and exterior utility systems.
6) Exterior site improvements, including, but not limited to, pavement, parking garages, and landscaping.

SCOPE OF WORK - PLANNING SERVICES:  When required by a task order, the contractor shall contract with an Architectural and Engineering (A-E) firm for planning services, and shall provide detailed surveying, site layout work, shop drawings and sketches, drawings, details, engineering calculations, building commissioning plans, and other related work as required to properly prepare and accomplish all work as required.  The degree of difficulty of the work will vary depending on the complexity of individual projects.  As part of every task order, record drawings shall be provided upon the completion of the work and shall be a condition of final payment.     

SCOPE OF WORK - CONSTRUCTION SERVICES:  Construction services shall be provided in response to individual task orders.  The work as described herein extends beyond the conventional, single project construction concept in that it may involve the planning, scheduling, coordination, procuring, and installation of a fluctuating series of unrelated tasks.  The work may vary from routine general construction to installation of complex special test laboratory systems.  Tasks will involve a variety of disciplines and trades including, but not limited to, engineering, carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, medical gases, HVAC, interior electrical, steam fitting, millwork, plumbing, sheet metal, painting and other finishes, demolition, concrete, masonry, welding, asbestos, and other hazardous material abatement.  

The selected contractors shall be responsible for, but not limited to the following services:

1) Shop drawing and submittal review
2) Construction inspection and construction support
3) Testing services, including construction material testing, factory witness testing, and field investigation and testing
4) Project Management
5) Cost Analysis
6) Schedule Development
7) Construction Evaluation and Assessment of Level and Quality of Work
8) Coordination (permits, document reviews) with local, State and Federal officials
9) Asbestos, lead-based paint, PCB’s and hazardous waste abatement projects including survey, inspection, testing, abatement, disposal and cost estimating
10) Evaluation of compliance with relevant environmental codes and regulations

<DESC>Description of Need:  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting information from industry on the existence of a non-developmental capability that provides tactical flexibility to the warfighter, in addition to the ability to hit moving targets, for use on the USN F/A-18 A+C/D/E/F, JSF and AV-8B aircraft.  NAVAIR anticipates that the solution would capitalize on existing direct attack inventories (GBU-12 Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) and/or GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM)).  Alternative solutions with affordable business cases will be considered.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to determine the availability of non-developmental solutions that have the potential to meet the stated objectives, to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support the possibility of a full and open competition to satisfy the objectives identified herein.  NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions and performance specification.   
  
Objectives:  The Moving Target Weapon (MTW) will be capable of effectively engaging moving targets in any operational environment, day or night and in adverse weather.  The target class should include, at a minimum:  armored vehicles, mobile scuds, trucks, air defense systems, and small surface combatants.  NAVAIR intends to procure the moving target capability in FY 2008.

Although subject to change, at present, the Government envisions that the moving target weapon capability solution would include the following characteristics: 
 
a.	A design based on current GBU-12 or GBU-38 architecture;
b.	GPS/INS, INS only and laser capability; 
c.	Engagement range of 2-15 nm when released between 20-30K feet and .8-.9 Mach; 
d.	A combination of accuracy and warhead effectiveness, utilizing a MK-82/BLU-111 warhead, that will provide sufficient single-shot lethality to ensure at least a mission/mobility kill;
e.	The weapon system would be reliable, maintainable and meet all requirements for deployment on CVN and LHA/LHD class ships as well as USN/USMC land bases; 
f.	It would utilize existing weapons handling, loading and test equipment; 
g.	The system must be affordable; and
h.	The weapon system would be capable of withstanding the environmental, temperature, vibration, and shock associated with shipboard and land based F/A-18A+C/D/E/F, JSF, and AV-8B aircraft flight operations without degradation in its capability. 

RFI Content: Any written response to this RFI shall be limited to no more than 25 pages.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  The response should include, but not be limited to, the following: 

a) A one page company history description to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, primary customer base, and point of contacts and their telephone numbers, who are able to discuss the material submitted;
b) A description of the company’s past experience and performance of weapon systems similar to that outlined above; 
c) A description of the existing weapon system, as well as a description of the modifications that would need to be made to the GBU-12 or GBU-38 and/or aircraft in order to satisfy the objectives identified above; and 
d) Any other technical information the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment. The technical responses should address, at a minimum, the following areas: 

1.	Weapon concept to include:  (a) performance and capabilities; (b) employment concept; (c) targeting and operational considerations; (d) pros/cons and trade space with respect to desired attributes and draft requirements; and (e) potential for growth and/or modularity. 
2.	Impact of design alternatives on aircraft integration.  
3.	Assessment of risk and technology maturity level.
4.	Tooling, test equipment, and production strategy. 
5.	Reliability, maintainability, and supportability. 
6.	Testing and verification requirements to include Modeling & Simulation capability to refine system performance and limitations.
7.	Total Life Cycle costs and considerations.

Submission Information:  It is NAVAIR’s intention to review the data and may schedule separate briefings with submitters.  Written responses to this RFI shall be submitted no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 18 September 2006 to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Mary Brutkiewicz, Air 2.4.4.3, 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, Building 2272, Suite 453, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Attn: Moving Target Weapon (MTW). Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to mary.brutkiewicz@navy.mil.  

Additional Information:   There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought (SS) announcement only.  The sole purpose of this synopsis is to identify potential sources only.  This SS announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. The United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) and the United States Army Program Executive Officer for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager Instrumentation Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) Targets Managem ent Office (TMO) are seeking sources for a non-pyrotechnical, portable ground launching system for a variety of diverse aerial target systems used in live fire tracking and engagement testing by air defense missile systems to be conducted on Department of Defense test and training ranges. The TMO procures, operates, and maintains a variety of aerial target systems to support Army test and training operations worldwide.  Aerial targets included in this SS announcement are the MQM-107 (1444 pounds gross weight / 145.6 knots launch speed / 4.5 8 G nominal acceleration), MQM-170 (100 pounds maximum gross weight / 60 knots launch speed), YMQM-171 (450 pounds maximum gross weight / 70 knots launch speed), and a future target system (700 pounds approximate maximum gross weight / 87 knots approximate  launch speed).  These targets are currently launched from a variety of launcher rails using an assortment of launch assist techniques including rocket assisted takeoff and pneumatic pressure.  The TMO is interested in reducing cost associated with launching targets and desires to consolidate its fixed wing aerial target launcher systems into a single launcher that is capable of meeting the weight and airspeed requirements of the family of aerial  targets, does not employ pyrotechnical devices in any form, is completely independent of any external power requirements, is capable of operating in harsh range conditions; is fully transportable by road, rail, air, and sea; is capable of being set up and  fully operational in the field in less than four hours by no more than four individuals, is capable of being converted to launch different target systems in no more than 30 minutes by four individuals operating in the field, is capable of being disassembl ed and packed for transport at a field location in no more than four hours by four individuals, is capable of multiple target launches once set up at a range site with no more than ten minutes between launches including aerial target loading onto the launc her, is capable of being maintained and repaired under field conditions by trained personnel with a minimal need for special tools or test equipment, and is very inexpensive to operate, i.e. less than $50 per launch event.  Launcher systems may be self-pro pelled or towed.  Launcher system should be sufficiently robust to handle multiple launches on a daily basis and approximately 1000 launches annually. A multiple launcher solution will be considered if it provides an optimal operational cost solution.    The launcher system will be operated on Department of Defense and Allied Nation test and training ranges within the United States and overseas.  The launcher systems will be required to operate during periods of daylight and darkness and under Basic, Hot-D ry, and limited Cold-Wet climatic conditions.   Sources are sought which have existing mature hardware (either COTS or as a result of R&D) as well as sources with experience in similar/compatible projects who may be interested in providing aerial target launcher systems to the Government.  Any company w ith the expertise to provide the required target launcher system is invited to submit a statement of interest by 30 Sep 06 along with data to substantiate its qualifications. Data provided to substantiate qualifications should include information on curren t products meeting, the general characteristics stated in this announcement and the reason(s) a suggested product could be expected to achieve the capabiliti es requested.  Sources with similar/compatible experience should provide the contract number of any current or previous government contract(s) for similar products.  Sources should provide a rough order of magnitude for meeting the launcher requirements in cluding purchase price for existing launcher systems.  The submission of a statement of interest does not constitute participation in any future request for proposal. This SS announcement does not constitute a request for proposal.  Responses to this SS announcement will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SS announcement.  All information should be submitted to Mr. Beau Beaufait, Targets Management Office, Building 3203, Hercules Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL  3589 8 or email beau_beaufait@peostri.army.mil no later than September 30, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES
<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES 
FOR PATIENTS WITH WELL CHARACTERIZED GASTROPARESIS

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide novel agents and devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies for the treatment of patients with well-characterized gastroparesis.  

Gastroparesis is a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and early satiety.  Physiological studies are characterized by delayed emptying of the stomach.  There are multiple etiologies, such as diabetes and surgical injury to the vagus nerve, but the most common etiological category is idiopathic.

INTRODUCTION:  The Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) will conduct multicenter clinical research studies of patients with gastroparesis using defined clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions and will collect samples that may be useful for ancillary studies of etiology and pathogenesis. 

A prospective Gastroparesis Registry of patients with diabetic, idiopathic, and post-surgical gastroparesis was created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,000 patients for 3 years on average.  In addition to collecting clinical patient data, Registry patients will submit serum and DNA samples.  Thus, ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis also pose collaborative opportunities.

STUDY GOALS:  The GpCRC principal investigators wish to consider potential new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with gastroparesis.  The overall goal of the GpCRC is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with gastroparesis using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of gastroparesis and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by using the Gastroparesis Registry which includes clinical information as well as serum and DNA samples.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with GpCRC by providing novel therapeutic agents or devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies, which could include: (1) prokinetic agents such as dopamine D-2 receptor antagonists, motilin receptor agonists, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor agonists, or cholecystokinin receptor antagonists versus placebo; (2) tricyclic antidepressant and related agents such as selective serotonin or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors versus placebo; (3) botulinum toxin injection versus placebo; (4) antiemetic agents such as aprepitant or serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) inhibitors such as palonosetron versus placebo; (5) novel analgesic agents such as pregabalin or gabapentin or derivatives of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) versus placebo; (6) gastric electrical stimulation or other devices versus placebo; and (7) complementary therapies such as herbal medicine, acupressure and electrical acustimulation, or acupuncture versus placebo in patients with well characterized gastroparesis.

The NIDDK is also seeking capability statements from companies for ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis.  Examples of potential ancillary studies include:  1) Exploration of serum markers for gastroparesis and serum markers for disease activity to predict gastric histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, and metabolomic variables in the Gastroparesis Registry;  2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in gastroparesis treatment trials;  3) Development of serum proteomic, metabolomic, and genomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of gastroparesis and that would provide surrogates for symptom severity as well as insights into the pathophysiology of this disease; and 4) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing disease activity in gastroparesis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.  Examples of the Clinical Trial Agreement and the CRADA can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria:  

1.	The proposed preparation must have been tested in Phase I trials in humans.

3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  
4.	A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing.
5.	A description of other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  
6.	A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
7.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of gastroparesis, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.  
8.	If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research.
9.	Must agree to have their preparation used in the above-mentioned GpCRC-developed protocols which will be conducted by GpCRC and will have data collection and analysis performed by the GpCRC Data Coordinating Center.

<DESC>The Department of Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse Mental health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), requires a contractor to provide services for the following:

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.  In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations. 

Geographical designations are specified.  For this particular requisition, the contractor must agree to provide technical assistance and training to faith and community organization including ATR treatment and recovery providers in the state of New Jersey.

Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations.

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.

Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations.

The purpose of this contract is to assess the CDRH website from the perspective of regulated industry in order to help set the requirements for designing a user-friendly site.

C.Project Officer

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any
subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to
any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall
be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present
value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

- The tree debris will be removed from the site by the Contractor who will be responsible for all loading, transportation, and disposal costs.
- The tree stumps should be ground to a minimum six inches below the surface and the holes filled with a quality top soil for with sod repair.
- The grass used for sod repair should be a blend of fescue with no Kentucky 31 fescue variety. All sod repairs should be to normal landscape standards.
- The parking lot areas will be returned to the original conditions except the tree removal, sod repairs, and minor shrub and bush changes.
- The Contractor will supply all labor, required equipment, supplies, safety equipment, disposal and governmental fees, and cleanup including possible chemical spills.

<DESC>Description

(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

(ii)	Solicitation No. is RFQ 06-09, which is issued as a request for quotations (RFQ), under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13.  

(iii)	The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  All referenced FAR clauses may be obtained via the Internet at URL http://www.acqnet.gov/far/.  

(iv)	Notice:  This acquisition is not set aside.  The NAICS code is 541720 and the small business size standard is:  $6.5 million. 

(v)	The purchase order will have one line item:  Study on Artist Population Trends to 2005.   The anticipated award date is November 2006.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated to be awarded. 

(vi)	DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:

Background:  The Research Division of the National Endowment for the Arts has analyzed information on artist employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and geographic distribution using decennial Census results since 1975.  The size of the decennial Census sample affords a unique opportunity to examine smaller occupations in significant demographic and geographic detail.  The last research report using decennial Census results was Research Division Report #29, which covered trends from 1970 to 1990 (available at:  http://www.arts.gov/pub/Report29.pdf).  This new study will analyze the Public Use Microdata Files from the 2000 Census of Population and the American Community Surveys (from 2001 to 2005).  Examining the American Community Survey adds an important new dimension.  The American Community Survey is a new, large national survey with a unique rolling sample design that the Census Bureau has undertaken to, among other goals, replace the decennial Census Public Use Microdata Files beginning in 2010.  Working with the American Community Survey data will not only provide more up to date data on the artist population, but will help current and future arts researchers understand how to work with this new, complex data base.

Statement of Work:  The purpose of the contract is to obtain information on artist employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and geographic distribution using the Public Use Microdata Files from the 2000 Census of Population and the American Community Surveys (from 2001 to 2005).  The contractor shall obtain the raw data files from the Bureau of the Census, prepare extract files containing data on individuals in artist occupations, produce summary tabulations, analyze the data results, and prepare a summary report that describes the overall findings using text, graphs, and tables, as appropriate.  In addition, the contractor shall provide copies of the extract files and a brief overview of their contents and instructions on how to use them.  The summary report will, to the extent possible, compare trends with earlier Census of Population data on comparable artist occupational groups such as those described in National Endowment for the Arts Research Division Report #29.  The summary report (approximately 20-30 pages of text and 20-30 pages of graphs and tables), at a minimum, shall analyze and describe trends in the demographic characteristics and geographic distribution of artists based on information from these two data sets, and to the extent possible, compare the results to those from prior Census (1990, 1980, 1970) artist extract files.  (The 1970 and the 1990 Census artist extract files are available for downloading at: http://www.cpanda.org/data/profiles/census_ae.html . )

The contractor shall complete the following tasks:

I.	Within two weeks after contract award, the contractor shall meet with the COTR to discuss initial plans for the project.
II.	Within four weeks after award, the contractor, in consultation with the COTR, shall develop a detailed work plan for the project.
III.	Within 16 weeks after award, the contractor shall utilize the Public Use Microdata Files for the 2000 Census of Population and the American Community Survey (from 2001 to 2005), and create extract files of households containing artists (selecting comparable occupational codes to those selected in the 1990 Census for Research Division Report #29).
IV.	Within 24 weeks after award, the contractor shall provide summary tabulations from both the Census and American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Files extract files that cross-tab artist occupational groups by similar variables to those found in Research Division Report #29.
V.	Within 34 weeks after award, the contractor shall provide a draft report (approximately 20-30 pages of text and 20-30 pages of tables) describing and analyzing the overall demographic, economic, and geographic trends in these artist occupations from 2000 to 2005, and, to the extent possible, from 1970 to 2000. 
VI.	Within 40 weeks after award, the contractor shall produce and deliver the final summary report revised to incorporate comments from the COTR.
VII.	Within 42 weeks after award, the contractor shall provide the artist extract files in electronic format, such as CD-ROMs, for the 2000 Census of Population Public Use Microdata Files and the American Community Survey (2001-2005), along with a brief overview (less than 10 pages) of the contents and instructions for use.

(vii)	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.  The period of performance will be ten months, anticipated to begin in November 2006.

(viii)	FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (JAN  2006) applies.

Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.

If the Fas t Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the i nstallation.

<DESC>NOTE:  The Solicitation Number has changed to 200-2006-18431


*  THIS RESPONSE IS DUE BY 10:00 AM ON 29 AUGUST 2006 *

Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta), 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Atlanta, GA, 30341-4146

       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam; this is a Request for Quotation for providing these services and products.     The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.     The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.     The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.     The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Included in this description is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
       
       Each offeror MUST submit ALL required certifications showing proof of meeting the government's requirements with their quotation, which are listed here:

       *  Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country; a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.     The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.  
       
       *  The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

       *  Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

       *  It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

      *  It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

      *  All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must have within their possession/on file specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

      *  *  Although the purchase order will be unpriced, all offerors are required to submit current pricing information for all drugs listed below.  The requirement for current pricing information is for evaluation purposes.  However, prices submitted will be used to determine the acceptability and fair and reasonability of prices included in resultant invoices.  Those quotes that do not include pricing information will not be considered for award.  Please refer to the attachment of sample drugs when developing price quotations.  A price for each range listed shall be included.  If quotations do not follow the format of the attachment and include prices for all quantity ranges, the quotation will not be considered.  IAW FAR 13.302-2 a realistic monetary limitation shall be placed on the total order. The monetary limitation shall be an obligation subject to adjustment when the firm price is established. The contracting officer or the contracting officer’s designated representative shall review the invoice price and, if reasonable (see FAR13.106-3(a)), process the invoice for payment.

Brand Name or Equal :

1.  The 412 MXS/MXMAPI request the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of a Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries 53 foot drop frame trailer to support crash recovery operations at Edwards Air Force Base.

2.  The trailer will be equipped with 100% of crash recovery equipment used to support 26 different weapon systems with full crash recovery capability.  This trailer must be designed and constructed to be towed across unapproved roadways; the trailer will be required to travel on and off road in conditions that normal vehicles would find difficult to navigate. They developed the "drop frame" trailer systems, which have become a staple in the moving industry Kentucky trailers “drop frame” systems represent significant advances in performance over comparable straight trailers. The salient functional characteristics of Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are essential to the 412 MXS/MXMAPI Crash Recovery operations as follows:

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers are built to our specifications.

•	Kentucky Trailers/Kentucky Trailer Industries trailers drop frame trailers typically hold 5 - 25 percent more volume than comparable straight trailers which allow us to consolidate 26 different aircraft’s related equipment into one location for better equipment accountability.
 
•	The trailer requested will free up essential personnel and equipment needed to perform other functions during aircraft recovery operations.
   
3.  Kentucky Trailer/Kentucky Trailer Industries is the only known corporation that can build a crash recovery trailer to meet our rigid specifications.  Other trailer builders are more suited towards building vehicle trailers that are designed for on-road applications.  Our unique requirement to recover aircraft in locations where rough terrain is the norm rather than the exception require us the have the best possible design and construction possible. 

4.  As an Aircraft Repair Flight practice, we try to avoid Brand Name or Equal situations as much as possible.  There are times however, when due to mission requirements and the lack of companies that provide unique aerospace support, we are sometimes forced to use the Brand Name or Equal process.  We will continue to do our best to try and avoid these situations in the future.
