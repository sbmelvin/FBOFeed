<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">On June 15, 2006, the President of the United States signed into law the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act, commonly known as the MINER Act. The Act was created in response to a cluster of mine tragedies that occurred in early 2006. This legislation amended the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1977, resulting in significant changes to U.S. mining laws. It established the requirements for post-accident communications and tracking, and a section of the Act charged the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with developing and improving mine-safety technologies.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">The MINER Act required each coal mine to submit an emergency response plan, which includes post-accident communications and tracking, to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) within three years of the enactment date. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In 2006, virtually no MSHA-approved communications and tracking (C&amp;T) systems that met the intent of the MINER Act were commercially available. As a result, NIOSH established a comprehensive research program to develop new, and enhance existing, communications and tracking technologies for post-accident applications in underground coal mines. Furthermore, the private sector developed additional systems in parallel with NIOSH's efforts; in fact MSHA reported that its Approval and Certification Center had reviewed and approved more than 50 communications and tracking products by March 2010.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">This RFP addresses tracking systems, but much of the work can be applied to wireless voice and text communications. Two basic types of tracking systems have emerged - reader-based and radio node-based - as described in the NIOSH Tutorial on Mine Communications and Tracking. Both systems rely on the transmission and reception of electromagnetic (EM) energy; therefore, their performance is highly dependent on the propagation behavior of EM signals in an underground mining environment. Currently, systems operate at 433 MHz, 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 6.0 GHz, and these systems are now being installed in underground coal mines throughout the U.S. Although NIOSH and manufacturers have shown the applicability and effectiveness of these systems on a limited basis through in-mine demonstrations, many questions still remain unanswered with respect to performance requirements and performance validation.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">A variety of factors contribute to the uncertainty surrounding performance requirements with tracking systems. First of all, the use of electronic tracking systems for emergency applications is relatively new, even for surface applications where the availability of GPS makes the problem much more manageable. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spent many years grappling with a reasonable way to define the performance requirements of the E911 system, which is intended to locate people placing cell-phone emergency calls. Therefore, it is not surprising that the MINER Act did not specify performance requirements. The MINER Act requirement that systems be <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">calculated to be serviceable post disaster </em>also generated unanswerable questions since there were no precedents on which to rely for establishing post-disaster performance requirements. Compounding these issues, underground coal mining is a dynamic environment, particularly in a working section of a mine. A modern coal mine can advance hundreds of feet a day, which results in continual changes to the C&amp;T system and propagation medium, such as movement of antennas and reconfiguration of the mine ventilation system. Because the mining sector lacks predictive and measurement-based evaluation tools, the establishment of practical performance metrics creates a challenge.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 27pt">The absence of performance metrics is problematic for both mine operators and enforcement agencies. This RFP addresses the following three areas of need:</p>

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Oman Systems, Inc. (OSI) for a license subscription to OSI's bid-tabs highway construction cost data. The anticipated award will include a year subscription with FHWA options to purchase one or two additional yearly subscriptions. The subscription is expected to provide FHWA with quarterly data, technical support, program upgrades, and access to OSI's customer network. The subscription will support the National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI). This is anticipated to be a simplified acquisition with an expected award the week of May 3rd, 2010.
<p><br />OCI is uniquely qualified for this procurement. FHWA developed the NHCCI to use OCI data due to the comprehensive, precise, detailed, and current nature of OCI data. To continue production of the NHCCI, FHWA requires on-going acquisition of OSI datasets. To maximize the utility of the NHCCI, the index must have a complete and consistent set of data with variables that stay constant from year-to-year. If the same dataset is not used, the entire software application would have to be revised to accommodate the new data and consistency with earlier index results would be invalid. As a result, a substitute for OCI would require FHWA to redesign its NHCCI application, which would be unreasonably costly and time-consuming and would substantially lessen the benefit of the NHCCI because there would not be consistency over time.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit a response identifying their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, which will be considered by FHWA. Information received by FHWA will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The proposed contract action is for products and services which FHWA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1 and 13.501. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>

The contractor shall work with FDA to harmonize variable names and terminology as needed to allow analysis across multiple studies.  The requirement will also support the advancement of current standards and support the development of new standardized values for domain data by ensuring alignment to the appropriate standard development organization (SDO; e.g. CDISC, HL7).

The requirement entails the Contractor be able to provide the project management, expertise, and labor leading to the successful conversion of the legacy data to its standardized format.  The requirement has been set aside for small business and will be open competitively to all small business firms who wish to compete.

<DESC>Background: The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Retrieval Group (Information Access Division/Information Technology Laboratory) runs large-scale evaluations of information retrieval systems such as document retrieval, question answering, and summarization systems.
<p>The work of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory, Information Access Division, Retrieval Group includes a set of projects whose purpose is to foster the development of computer systems that are able to analyze and manipulate the information content of artifacts originally constructed for consumption by humans.</p>
<p>One of the artifacts of interest includes automatic summarization systems that will help a person track or follow up on a news story by giving the person summaries that focus on what is new or different as the story develops over time. The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) portion of the task is to decide whether the content of one text fragment can be inferred from (i.e., is entailed by) the content of another text fragment. Recognizing textual entailment is a sub-problem of many human language processing tasks such as question answering and summarization. While humans are so good at processing entailment that they seldom even notice when they are doing it, automatic recognition of entailment is a challenging problem. The RTE portion of the task is developing resources to test systems' ability to recognize and process textual entailment. <br /><br />The end result of this project is to use the information gathered from the Contractor to modify, test or improve exiting search engines and also to develop new state of the art search engines. Also, this information is shared with universities around the USA that are developing new ways to search for data on the web. This project is part of the NIST mission of "promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement in science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life". With this project NIST wants to advance the existing technology and to help create new technologies that help to improve our way of life. <br /><br />Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition in the area of automatic summarization systems testing through the use of article summarization and textual entailment procedures. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). NIST also intends to compete this acquisition as a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 541990, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The period of performance is anticipated to be less than six months. The Government intends to utilize the Labor Hour contract type for these services because it is not possible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with a reasonable degree of confidence.<br /><br />Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. Quotations will be due no later than 10 days after the solicitation is posted at www.fbo.gov.<br /><br />Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.<br /><br />All questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to the primary point of contact: Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for gamma scintillation survey meter systems for evaluation and potential fielding to Navy end users.  The system shall consist of a control unit and gamma scintillation probe.  A carrying case shall be provided with each system.  Currently the Navy utilizes the IM-253 gamma scintillation survey meter family -- comprised of four separate models -- to perform required surveys.  For each of the IM-253 models, both the main control unit (count-rate meter) and gamma scintillation probe (Eberline model SPA-3) are no longer manufactured.  The Navy still has ample operational SPA-3 probes to utilize.  However, a new control unit is needed to interface with the current SPA-3 probe population and to extend the lifetime of the IM-253 suite of equipment.  Under this procurement 350 control units for Navy personnel radiation survey capabilities and 350 gamma scintillation probes, which will supplement the SPA-3 probe population, will be provided over a five (5) month period of performance.
This procurement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 334519 and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and award a firm fixed price purchase order.  The system is expected to be a commercial off-the-shelf item which has been modified to meet the requirements in the RFQ.  The RFQ will be issued and posted on FedBizOpps on or about 03 May 2010.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for engineering testing and analysis services for managing shipboard wastewaters (oily, black, gray, combined black/gray, non-skid surface cleaning, and plasma arc waste destruction) and shore-side ship maintenance action wastewaters (hull cleaning, vertical launch system, and heat exchanger flushing).  These services will be provided as a result of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) exploratory development solicitation.  This procurement required services in the area of solids separation and concentration of shipboard wastewaters and residuals by a High Shear Rotary Membrane System (HSR-MS).  The procurement will have a period of performance from the effective date of the contract through 3 years thereafter.
The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved.  The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Civil and Environmental Engineering Department (CEE).  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). UMBC CEE research engineers and scientists have considerable experience with both HSR-MS and shipboard wastes.  They have been working on various HSR-MS and/or Navy waste solids issues for over four years and have developed initial advanced HSR-MS concepts that require further development, testing, and verification.  Award to any other source at this stage of the program would result in duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in an unacceptable time delay.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received by 30 April 2010, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Heather Valiga by e-mail at heather.valiga@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-3476 on or before 04/30/10.

These services will primarily be provided within EPA Region 1 (which encompasses the area of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), however, there is the possibility of performance in other regions due to regional crossover.   It is the Government's intent to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from this solicitation through a small business set-aside.  The resulting contract will contain fixed rates for labor.  The Government may issue either Time-and-Materials (T&M) or Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders.  The anticipated ordering period includes a sixty (60) month Base Period, and two (2), 12 month Award Terms with a maximum potential ordering period totaling eighty-four (84) months.  The total estimated level of effort for this requirement in professional labor hours for all years is 50,455 hours.
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million.  This is not a request for submission of proposals.  The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about June 2010 with an award anticipated in March 2011.  This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511120   The US EPA/OAR Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Wood Mackenzie of Boston, MA for one-year subscriptions to three (3)Wood Mackenzie coal service subscriptions: (1) "Long Term US Steam Coal Outlook" (2) "US Powder River Basin" and (3) "US Central Appalachia."
The justification is as follows. These subscriptions are needed in order to assess whether and how to update the coal supply curves used by EPA in the Integrated Planning Model of the U.S. power sector.  Those supply curves, were developed for EPA in 2009 by Wood Mackenzie.  EPA requires the three Wood Mackenzie coal service subscriptions because they use the same underlying approach employed in the development of EPA's coal supply curves.  No other coal projection would provide the required consistency in approach.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contract specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Management on the behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS), intends to award a  contract on a  sole-source basis to Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce, 2020 East Lonnie Abbott, Ada OK 74820 . The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). This procurement will be awarded under Part 15 of the FAR Contracting by Negotiation.

The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal health care provider and health advocate for American Indian and Alaska Native people. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to 564 federally recognized tribes in 35 states. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is the health information system that supports the provision of patient care services at Indian Health Service and Tribally operated health care facilities across the nation. IHS and Tribes operate some 40 hospitals that use the RPMS. All of these facilities have Emergency Departments, Urgent Care clinics, or both. Many outpatient facilities also have busy Urgent Care operations.
Patient and staff workflows in these settings are different than in general clinic settings; users have requested a "dashboard" capability to permit clinicians and managers to efficiently allocate available resources (rooms, providers, ancillary staff) to promote patient safety and improve flow through the system.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above. 
Interested parties who feel that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim, inclusive of references listing contact person(s) and phone number(s). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses. However, all information received within 15 days of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 15 days, the Government shall negotiate and award to the Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce.

The acquisition of SCADA software other than iFIX will result in the need to purchase new IDEs that are specific to the brands which combined with the cost of these new IDEs and the time to learn the operation of the IDEs could result in a serious delay in the implementation of the upgrade to the system. <BR><BR>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Clare.Huntley@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in subject line no later than, no later than 4:00PM CST on April 20, 2010.

Due to the emergent nature of this situation, this project shall be negotiated directly with a qualified, local, veteran owned plumbing contractor currently working on site and available to begin work immediately.Work consists of furnishing and installing a new water heater system, new circulating system, associated steam, cold water, hot water and re-circulating water piping, insulation, controls and removal of the old system equipment.The magnitude of this project is between $25,000 and $100,000.

The laboratory contractor must be capable of providing emergency or non-routine services 24-hours a day 365 days per year to include after normal business hours, weekends, and holidays.</p>
<p>Capacity: The contractor must have the appropriate capacity to analyze a large number of samples on a regular basis. Proper capacity is crucial to maintain acceptable turn-around-time for sample results.</p>
<p>Cost: The contractor should have costs consistent with industry standards and comparable to previous water lab contracts.</p>
<p><br />EXISTING CONTRACT INFORMATION: Laboratory Sample Analytical Testing Services are currently performed under contract FA8601-08-P-0075, which expires 30 November, 2010. The incumbent contractor is Belmonte Park Environmental Laboratories, CAGE Code 3DAH5.

The firm should also state if it is a small business in the NAICS Code applicable to the requirement. Capabilities statements, proposals, or quotes should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate the ability to provide the required services at fair and reasonable prices.</p>

<DESC>Advanced Technology Vehicle Evaluations
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory actively supports the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Transportation by providing technical evaluations of advanced technologies in various real-world applications. The work supports test projects initiated by these agencies including DOEs Fuel Cell Technology Program and the DOTs Federal Transit Administration. The primary activity is to collect fleet and vehicle operations data, documenting fleet implementation experiences with fuel cell technology vehicles in a variety of applications. 

The primary objectives of these projects are to:

 Provide comprehensive, unbiased (third-party) information on advanced technology vehicle performance (including fuel cell vehicles).
 Assess status of the newest technologies in real-world service
 Establish a benchmark of current and near-term technologies
 Share lessons learned about implementation experience

Evaluation projects on prototype/early market vehicles focus on the commercialization process and progress--in other words, a technology assessment. Most evaluations include economic, technical, emissions, and safety factors. Data are collected on the operation, maintenance, performance, and, sometimes, the emissions characteristics of advanced technology fleets and comparable baseline fleets (if available) operating in a similar duty-cycle. (Baseline technology depends on the application but could include diesel, compressed natural gas, electric, or propane vehicles.) Operators considering the use of advanced vehicles comprise the primary intended audience for this information. Information provided through these evaluations will help fleet owners and operators facilitate purchase decisions on the technology. Results from the evaluations also feed back into the development process for DOE/DOD/DOT and technology manufacturers. 

NREL is seeking an organization with expertise in working with various project partners to collect and analyze data on fuel cell vehicles. To support NREL with this effort, an organization must document specific capabilities, attributes, and skills as indicated:  

 Document historical experience, and an extensive technical knowledge of advanced propulsion systems (specifically experience with fuel cell systems) in various applications.
 Document historical experience and technical knowledge of supporting alternative fueling infrastructure equipment (including hydrogen).
 Document an understanding of various industries that employ vehicle fleets including truck, transit, and ground support equipment (such as forklift) operations. 
 Document the ability to act as a third-party evaluator.
 Document an understanding of heavy vehicle performance testing and emissions testing.
 Document an understanding of vehicle operations tracking database systems, data processing, statistical analysis techniques, and ensuring quality data for analysis.
 Document an understanding of vehicle and operations life-cycle cost modeling methods.
 Document an understanding of data analysis and methods to show the potential business case for early market applications.
 Document experience in organizing strategic planning exercises.
 Document the ability to build relationships with project partners (i.e., fleet personnel, vehicle manufacturers, integrators, engine/propulsion manufactures, DOE/DOD/DOT/NREL and other labs, etc.) and work in a team.
 Provide documentation that the organization has significant contacts and resources in the advanced technology transportation field, specifically with fuel cell technology.

In order to control costs, interested parties should have a proven ability to perform all the work within their organization without subcontracts or teaming arrangements with other organizations (except as requested by NREL). The response to this SOURCES SOUGHT DOCUMENT is limited to 8 pages of single space text of 12-point font or equivalent, with a minimum of 1 inch margins all around. Brevity is encouraged. 

Any organization interested in working with NREL to provide the technical expertise described within this document may mail a list of qualifications to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Attn: Laura Hughes, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1735, Golden, CO 80401-3305. Telephone calls will not be accepted; however, submittal by email is encouraged and should be sent to: laura.hughes@nrel.gov. Electronic format of the Sources Sought response shall be MSWord or Excel. Please do not send scanned .PDFs. Qualifications will be responsive to the items listed above. Responses to this notice, whether mailed hardcopy or electronically, must be received by 4:00 p.m. MDT, April 29, 2010. Responding to this request identifies your organization as an interested candidate only. Your submittal is not in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP).

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH For the COMMON ANALYTICAL LABORATORY SYSTEM (CALS) PROGRAM<BR>  <BR>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY.  Requests for copies of solicitation will not receive a response.  <BR><BR>The Joint Product Manager, Consequence Management (JPdM-CM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is conducting market research to identify potential sources with the capability to integrate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive Detection Equipment (CBRNE) into a Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS), being developed by JPdM-CM. <BR><BR>JPdM-CM is releasing this request for information (RFI) as a follow-up to a RFI posted in July 2009. The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the intent of the CALS effort and to gather information from sources capable of system level mobile laboratory integration. The source should be able to provide engineering and integration capabilities to the CALS program during the engineering and manufacturing phase leading to a Milestone C decision. A separate announcement has been posted to gather technology specific information from industry.  <BR><BR>JPdM CM requests that an information paper be submitted as part of the response. The information paper should address the following:  <BR><BR>1.	Describe your ability and strategy to support the CALS program both near and long term. What is your area of expertise? What facilities and support structure are currently in place and what is envisioned for the future?<BR>2.	Describe your teaming strategy. Does your company have the in house capability to support the CALS program or will other companies be included as part of your strategy?<BR>3.	Describe your integration capabilities. What hardware / software design tools will the company use to support the CALS program?<BR><BR><BR>The CALS is based on a modular mobile laboratory concept that will consist of deployable modules that can be tailored to the specific needs of the specific consequence management laboratory units, Service Commanders, Joint Task Force - Civil Support (JTF-CS) and Joint Force Commander (JFC). CALS will be a transportable, mobile, multi-capability CBRNE system of system, based on open system architecture, and comprised of specific technologies to assist the warfighter and first responders in identifying CBRNE hazards. CALS will be a modular, scalable, interoperable, and operationally integrated, mission-driven material solution for mobile lab analysis.  CALS will take a modular approach with respect to a smaller, deployable footprint consisting of flexible, adaptable, testable, plug n play capabilities; reduced power consumption; lighter, faster, and more accurate analytical equipment; net-centric, interoperable communications linked with external systems; more efficient laboratory processes, reduced personnel staffing; and expandable laboratory design.  <BR><BR>The CALS will provide a means to detect and quickly identify CBRNE materials in clinical specimens, environmental samples, and food samples; analyze, and provide field confirmatory and presumptive identification of threat agents, and genetically modified agents, to include low level biological warfare agents (BWA), chemical warfare agents (CWA), radiological material (RM), nuclear material (NM), high explosive residue (HER), toxic industrial compounds (TIC), and toxic industrial materials (TIM); and provide analytical results in an expedient manner to assist commanders in making risk management decisions about force protection measures to minimize the effects of a CBRNE event and allow the force to complete its mission.  <BR><BR>Pre-acquisition activities are currently underway to develop an acquisition strategy that minimizes the time and cost required to satisfy approved capability needs, and maximizes affordability throughout the program life-cycle. The initiation of the CALS Program is expected to begin in September 2011, with fielding expected to occur from 2014 through 2016.  Demonstration and selection of proposed capabilities is anticipated during the September 2010  September 2011 timeframe.<BR><BR>CALS capabilities will focus on:<BR>  <BR>"	Enhanced all-hazard sample analytical capabilities across CBRNE portfolios in order to increase confidence and sampling capability in support of Homeland Defense, as well as deployed CBRN and high explosive detection equipment;<BR><BR>"	Information management via a net-centric approach with a common information backbone for reach-back to subject matter experts; <BR><BR>"	An open, industry standard, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) capability, that uses Internet protocols for seamless device plug-in; a capability that provides the ability to plug a device into a network and have it recognize that the device is there, as well as when a new device had been added. The architecture of Universal Plug and Play should allow for the peer-to-peer networking of networked appliances, PCs, and wireless devices. It should be a distributed, open architecture based on UDP, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Universal Plug and Play will enable the communication between any two devices under the command of any control device on the network.<BR><BR>"	Automation that decreases the required skill sets necessary for sample handling, integration of data fusion and decision support; <BR><BR>"	Advanced Modeling and Simulation Tools that can characterize and model CBRN Hazard/Event Impacts; <BR> <BR>"	Optimized operational readiness via:<BR><BR>o	The use of human-factors engineering to design systems that require minimal manpower; provide effective training; can be operated and maintained by users; and are suitable (habitable and safe with minimal environmental and occupational health hazards) and survivable (for both the crew and equipment).<BR><BR>o	The use of integrated diagnostics, prognostics, and health management techniques in embedded and off-equipment applications, when feasible and cost-effective.<BR><BR>o	The use of robust engineering controls that are user friendly; enhances sample pre-screening preparation, protection, and storage; increases personnel safety; and has a broad spectrum alarm capability.<BR><BR>o	The use of embedded training and testing, with a preference for approved DoD Automatic Test Systems (ATS) Families to satisfy ATS requirements.<BR><BR>o	The use of serialized item management techniques and the use of automatic identification technology (AIT), radio-frequency identification, and iterative technology refreshment. <BR><BR>"	Integration of technologies and capabilities that will mature to meet Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8-9 standards by 2013.<BR><BR>"	Review and identification of technologies and capabilities that meet TRL 1-7 standards for future integration beyond 2013<BR><BR>The anticipated components of the CALS will include the following:<BR><BR>"	Analytical Component Suite<BR>	Chemical Suite<BR>	Biological Suite<BR>	Radiological Suite<BR>	High-Yield Explosive Suite<BR>"	Environmental Controls Component Suite<BR>"	Engineering Controls Component Suite<BR>"	Power Component Suite<BR>"	Diagnostics/Built-in-Test (BIT) Equipment (BITE) Component Suite<BR>	Provides the increased ability to launch on time, launch on demand, and improves the degree of supportability of critical components. <BR>"	A power-on self-test that performs a comprehensive test. <BR>"	A periodic test that assures the device has not become unsafe/inoperable since the power-on self test.<BR>"	A self-test to discover whether the device needs repair or calibration<BR>"	System of System Integration Support Component Suite<BR>	Communication Suite<BR>	Decision Support and Data Management & Analysis Suite <BR>	Embedded Training Suite<BR>	Software Applications Suite<BR><BR>Equipment must be capable of operating in an all-hazard environment for sustained periods of at least 72 hours without outside technical support for repair or operations.  <BR><BR>Consumable materials and ancillary equipment must be fully identified, even if manufactured by other vendors than themselves.  <BR><BR>JPdM-CM is also interested in equipment networks or software facilitated data exchanges with commonly used computer equipment which would allow for the compiling of data for a variety of detection and analytical equipment.  <BR><BR>All companies that can provide capability to integrate, at a system level, present and future CBRNE analytical instrumentation; decision support and data management and analysis capabilities; chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) sampling, detection and identification equipment for Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA) / Toxic Industrial Chemicals / Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM), Biological Warfare Agents (BWA), Radiological Materials and High Explosive Residue (HER); personal protection equipment (PPE), and decontamination equipment to be used by military and Civil Support Teams (CST); an open, industry standard, Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) capability; diagnostics/Built-in-Test (BIT) Equipment (BITE); embedded training capabilities, methods, and platforms (e.g. lap top computer based training (CBT), PDAs, IPods, DVD/CD, memory sticks, etc.), and interoperable net-centric communication and video capabilities; as well as possible air, land, water deployable platforms should submit information.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Sources Sought<br />Ref# 2010-Q-12086</strong></p>
<p><br />The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, Epidemiology and Strategic Information Branch, is seeking contractor sources with an understanding of the variety of laboratory assays that have been developed to estimate HIV incidence using cross-sectional data.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of this project are:<br />&bull; To determine the proportion of samples from individuals in select populations in Eastern and Southern Africa with known HIV positive status of greater than 12 months that misclassify as recent infection on the assay (otherwise known as the "false-recent" rate). <br />&bull; To estimate assay-derived incidence using the observed false-recent rate in similar cross-sectional sites in Eastern and Southern Africa where the incidence assay(s) have been or will be applied.<br />&bull; To compare assay-derived incidence to other measures of incidence in the same population.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work</p>
<p>There are ongoing cohort studies for HIV incidence in multiple sites in Africa to identify candidate sites for HIV prevention research among populations at risk for HIV infection. We propose to integrate incidence assay validation studies within these cohorts, particularly those in Eastern and Southern Africa for settings where false-recent rates have not been established (e.g. Ethiopia and Mozambique) but where assay-based incidence surveys have been conducted or currently being planned. Validation studies will: 1) quantify the level of misclassification among HIV-infected persons with &gt; 12 months of infection on the various assays; 2) estimate assay-derived incidence in cross-sectional sites that are representative to the sample in which the false-recent rate is derived; 3) compare assay-based incidence to other measures of incidence (e.g. comparisons against directly observed incidence, other assays).</p>
<p><br />Technical Requirements</p>
<p>Task 1: Conduct a false recent calibration study for HIV-1 incidence assays to determine the percentage of false recent samples from individuals with known HIV positive status of greater than 12 month duration</p>
<p>&bull; Develop protocol incorporating a false recent calibration study at the site<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data collection <br />&bull; Assist local laboratory staff to conduct incidence assay testing on entire sample of known long-term infections using:<br />o BED capture enzyme immunoassay<br />o New developmental assays (such as: the rIDR-M avidity index assay, the rIDR-M limiting antigen avidity assay, and the rapid incidence prevalence assay).<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data analysis, including development of the local false-recent rate for HIV-1 incidence assays<br />&bull; Assist local staff to develop a draft report on findings</p>
<p>Task 2: Estimate assay-derived incidence in a cross-sectional sample of HIV-infected persons at the study site and, where possible, compare to other measures of incidence (e.g. directly observed cohort incidence). <br />&bull; Develop protocol incorporating incidence estimation in a cross-sectional samples at the site or proxy population<br />&bull; Assist local laboratory staff to conduct incidence assay testing on a cross-sectional samples at the site or proxy populations using:<br />o BED capture enzyme immunoassay<br />o New developmental assays (such as: the rIDR-M avidity index assay, the rIDR-M limiting antigen avidity assay, and the rapid incidence prevalence assay)<br />&bull; Assist local staff to conduct data analysis for incidence estimation<br />&bull; Assist local staff to develop a draft report on findings</p>
<p><br />Deliverables</p>
<p>The following deliverables shall be delivered to the COTR:</p>
<p>Description Copies Due Date<br />Draft report 2 December 30, 2011<br />Final report 2 June 30, 2012</p>
<p><br />The base period of performance is July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2012. A one year (12 months) option period following the base period is possible.</p>
<p>This notification is intended to provide the Government with information on the availibility of qualified sources for the requirement. Any interested companies are welcome to submit their ability to provide this requirement via e-mail to ibi9@cdc.gov. Please include reference number (2010-Q-12086).

PROJECT DETAILS
Honokohau Harbor is located in the County of Hawaii, approximately 7-miles north of Kailua-Kona and 4-miles south of the Kona airport.  The Honokohau Harbor access road project begins at its intersection with Kealakehe Parkway and extends 0.2-mile toward the harbor, ending just before the boat washdown area.

This project consists of removing existing pavement and base roughly 24-feet wide by 4-inches deep, reconditioning of any remaining existing base course to a 6-inch depth (or to bedrock), and placing 4-inches of new hot asphalt concrete pavement.  Work includes constructing concrete and asphalt curb and adjusting utility appurtenances (manholes, water valves, etc) within the existing paved area to finished grade.  The work also includes regraveling a portion of the harbor parking area opposite the secondary entrance into the Koloko-Honokohau National Historic Park and constructing a 6-foot wide concrete sidewalk within this parking area.

The project will require the removal of approximately 3,000 square yards of existing asphalt pavement, 1,100-feet of roadbed reconditioning, 740 tons of hot asphalt concrete pavement, 200 tons of roadway aggregate, 30-feet of 6-inch concrete curb, 70-feet of 3-inch asphalt curb, 42 concrete wheel stops, and 83 square yards of concrete sidewalk.  Additional items of work include survey, erosion control, traffic control and signing and striping.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in April/May 2010 with construction beginning in July 2010 and extending for 3 months.

Estimated cost $400 to $900 thousand.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Vaccine Research Center (VRC) is seeking small business sources that can provide a full spectrum of clinical research support services to the VRC's Clinical trials Core (CTC) for universal influenza vaccines and for other vaccines developed for testing in human clinical trials. Specific contract areas will include 1) Coordinating clinical trial site selection and performance of vaccine clinical trial support; 2) Data management services; and 3) Regulatory support and monitoring services. It is anticipated that this requirement will be procured as an IDIQ, task order type contract due to the rapidly changing needs of the Vaccine Research Center. The contract may require support for up to 4 Phase-I clinical trials and 1 Phase-II clinical trial in each contract year. Task Order requirements may require the contractor to select and manage clinical trial sites throughout the United States simultaneously. The anticipated contract term is 5-years. All capable small businesses including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns should respond with a capability statement by April 23, 2010 at 11:00AM EDT. Capability statements must reference similar work that has been performed by the contractor and the dollar value of that work. Respondents should specifically address their ability to select and manage appropriate clinical trial sites based on study requirements and their ability to recruit and retain appropriate participants for a variety of clinical trials. Respondents must also demonstrate past experience with contracts of similar size and scope. This is a market survey, not a request for proposals. Capability statement should be no longer than 10 pages. All questions must be directed, in writing, to Michele Pearlman at pearlmanm@niaid.nih.gov</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.302-1, the National Park Service (NPS), Pacific West Regional Office (PWR) intends to award a non-competitive, firm fixed-price Architect-Engineer contract, that is greater than $25,000 but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, to Marcy Wong & Donn Logan Architects (MWDL), 800 Bancroft Way, Berkeley, California for Title I preliminary design services consisting of finalizing schematic documents and preparing design development documents (DDs) for the rehabilitation of the Historic Oil House for use as the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historic Park Visifor Education Center. The first floor of the existing Oil House, approximately 7,100 gross SF shall house primarily exihibit space, Cooperating Association Bookstore, and limited administrative space for Visitor Center Staff. The lower level, approximately 5,300 gross SF, when finished, shall house a multi-purpose room for classes and workshops, as well as a theater and support spaces such as a library, break room and restroom. Conceptual layout for all functional and exhibit spaces has been developed but certain functions associated with the locaiton of information desk and circulation core connecting to all levels within the existing space will require further refinement during the preparation of the design development documents (DDs). The purpose of this contract is to test the feasibility of the rehabilitation of the Oil House within an anticipated budget for tenant improvments, which is the subject of ongoing lease negotiations between the NPS, the City of Richmond and the building owner, Orton Development Inc (ODI). The anticipated finish of the Oil House would be comparable to those in the Ford Assembly Building spaces.
The determination for limiting compeittion is as follows: The NPS has been in negotiations for leasing the Historic Oil House at the Ford Assembly Building in Richnond, California for several months. The affected parties (NPS, City of Richmond and Orton Development Inc.) entered into mediation on March 18, 2010 in order to resolve a handful of critical lease terms and to move forward with lease negotiations. As a result of this mediation, the NPS needs to complete design documents (DDs) for the Historic Oil House building and associated cost estimates in order to proceed forward in these negotiations. At this point in the process, the negotiations are time-sensitive and the tentative terms of agreement from the mediation are fragile and therefore the delivery of the work product (DDs) from this contract would be 60 days from award. If this delivery is not met, the lease negotiations, particularly the NPS' position could be in jeopardy. 
The Architect-Engineer firm of MWDL has been the architectural firm on record for the rehabilitation of the Ford Assembly building, which includes the adjacent Historic Oil House building. The NPS is negotiating a lease for the use of the unimproved Historic Oil House to serve as the Visitor Center for Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front NHP. MWDL has been under contract with the Owner and Developer of the property, ODI.  MWDL has been the lead architect to date for rehabilitation of the main structure, the Ford Assembly building, and for the preliminary rehabilitation concepts for the Historic Oil House building. MWDL completed schematic design for the rehabilitation of the Historic Oil House for a previous prospective tenant, and thus has first-hand knowledge of the building's condition, historic character defining features, associated infrastructure and landscape. In addition, MWDL prepared the associated historic tax credit package on behalf of ODI for the entire complex. 
Previously, the NPS anticipated that ODI would provide the design services of MWDL for the Oil House rehabilitation; but with the recently negotiated terms of aforementioned mediataion, there was a change which resulted in NPS assuming responsiblity for design services. It is the intention of th NPS to continue the use of MWDL for this work, picking up where their work for ODI dropped off. MWDL is capable of providing the necessary design development package in an expedited manner, due to their previous work on this specific building project, as well as their work with ODI and his construction contractor who prosecuted the build-out of the space. Therefore NPS is intending to use MWDL as a sole source conractor due to the sensitive nature of the current lease negotiations and the short timeframe for completion of the design development documents and cost estimates.

DESCRIPTION

The Department of State (DoS) is performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities for an Enterprise Network Management System (EMS).  
The Enterprise Network Management System market is quite large and dispersed.  Many vendors offer EMS products that support the business management of enterprises using Internet Technology (IT).  Business enterprises design and implement an IT network infrastructure to provide a communications link to all corporate computer users within an enterprise. This IT infrastructure is comprised of network devices called routers and switches. These devices are regionally and globally interconnected to provide a communication path by which its users could process, send and receive mission critical business information. Previously, the strength of the IT network infrastructure was only defined by the computer access and availability of the above mentioned network devices. Recently, the market trend had evolved to the point where the strength of the enterprise IT network infrastructure is now defined by the more complex integration or correlation of all network events that occur on the enterprise network. This new network analysis and evaluation process is sometimes called IT Event Correlation. This request for information (RFI) hopes to gain information on the various capabilities that the industry can offer for Enterprise Network Management. This RFI focuses on nine (9) primary functional areas. 
These functional areas are:
	Manager of Managers 
	Performance and Fault Management
	End to-End Configuration Management 
	Syslog Capture and Query Capability  
	Application Performance Monitoring
	SNMP Reporting and Latency 
	Device Access Control and Security  
	Packet Capture and Netflow Reporting
	Centralized Software Management 

1.1	Terms and Definitions  
The Enterprise Network Management market consists of IT terminology that warrants some definition. Some of these terms are as outlined below include but are not limited to:
	Data Collection: Collection of data from managed devices on a network.
	Data Correlation: The processing of data from multiple managed devices to 
determine their causal and dependent relationships.
	Enterprise Discovery: The process of determining all the managed network devices on an enterprise business network.
	Network Modeling: Simulation of information flow and communications on a network using network modeling tools and software.
	Root-Cause Analysis: Determination of the original cause of multi-alarm events. 

The nine primary functional areas identified above are defined as:

	Manager of Managers - This is the highest level in the enterprise network management architecture. The network management subsystems defined below will forward status information up to the Manager of Managers. Its primary objective is to provide the functionality to be able to correlate information from lower level network management systems. It will create customized operational views that will be used to display and/or forward events and alarms to the appropriate person/groups that needs to know priority events occurring with in the enterprise. It will provide a single point of entry (login) for all the subsystems. The manager of manager will store event data, display the alerts and take preconfigured action when necessary.
	Performance and Fault Management - This subsystem will have the ability to monitor and display system availability and performance data of all devices in the Enterprise. Latency, SNMP collected data, and Event and Alarm management are displayed and recorded in this subsystem. The system shall have the ability to record and display historical performance data of any device in the enterprise including routers, switches, servers and desktops.
	End-to-End Configuration Management - This subsystem archives all the computer system configurations (startup, running, and past) of all the devices in the enterprise. These devices include but are not limited to routers, switches.  Computer systems such as servers and desktop workstations are also included. It should detect in real time when a network configuration change is made to any of the aforementioned devices. 
	System Log (Syslogs) Capture and Query Capability - This subsystem shall be able to query/capture all syslogs for every device on the network, parse syslogs for events of interests and forward them up to the Manager of Managers level. 
	Application Performance Monitoring - This subsystem shall be able to capture performance data compiled from various applications running on the network. This data will be used to monitor the performance of a computer application from a user client perspective as well as from the perspective of a network server running various application services. Examples are web client browser applications and web services running on web host server.
	SNMP Reporting and Latency - This subsystem will be able to measure and report on all SNMP MIB variables and latency network data collections. 
	Device Access Control and Security - This subsystem maintains the credentials and permissions to login into computer systems on the Enterprise network. Network technology such as single sign-on logins will be employed to more efficiently manage connections to multiple systems on the network.
	Packet Capture and Netflow Reporting - This subsystem shall be able to capture network packets and Netflow data between network devices. This data will be used for network packet inspection and to generate various reports.
	Centralized Software Management and Deployment  This is the subsystem that manages software application deployments and/or operating system patches. It can report on the operating system patch level of network devices, desktop workstations and servers.

<a href="mailto:acss@usmc.mil">Email ACSS Office at:</a>
<DESC>RFI --The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) contractors for FY11.  This notice provides information for both current and new vendors wishing to participate in the Command's Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August, 2002.   To date, $2.2+ billion in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $100K to $27.7 million.   CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404, which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  There are currently thirty (30) competitively awarded active BPAs established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.   
CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated FY11 Command requirements.   Additionally, each year CEOss assesses the need for new prime vendor awards in selected domains.   For FY11, openings are anticipated in two domains, ES and SE.  The anticipated BPA awards for FY11 include one (1) BPA in ES, unrestricted as to business size; one (1) BPA in SE, unrestricted as to business size; and one (1) BPA in SE reserved for small businesses.  In accordance with small business goals established for Department of Defense, in FY11 CEOss is implementing a small business subcontracting (or prime) requirement of a minimum of 10% of total task order value at the BPA level.  A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors on 03 May 2010.  We will offer two sessions,  0800 - 1100 and 1300 - 1600, which will provide detailed information about Command requirements and RFI submission guidance.  The workshop will take place in Quantico, Virginia at the Gray Research Center.  Attendance is on a first-come, first-served basis and may be restricted due to space constraints.  Participants are asked to arrive no earlier than 0730 for the morning session.    Questions regarding the workshop should be addressed to acss@usmc.mil.
CEOSS BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.   Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   Large business prime vendors are required to bid on at least 50% of all requirements within their domain.  Beginning FY11, small business prime BPA holders will be required to bid on at least 25% of all requirements within their domain.  There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.   There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering (SE), Business and Analytical (BA), Engineering and Scientific (ES), and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative (ALA).   Vendors are required to identify the open domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA within the proposal.  Vendors may submit proposals in all open domains, but can only be awarded one prime BPA.  To qualify for consideration in the ES domain you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or IT Services & Support (70) schedule.   To qualify in the SE domain, you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), Environmental Services (899), IT Services & Support (70), or Lab Testing & Analysis (873) schedule.   Although vendors may have a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted, with the exception that a prime vendor cannot be a subcontractor in the domain in which they hold their prime BPA.    
INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CEOSS APPLICANTS:    To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors must submit the following information NLT 11 May 2010.   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages, that identifies their firm's capabilities within a domain of prime interest (limited to domains open for this season, ES and SE), to include business size, team composition, business/management strategy, relevant experience, and rate discounting policy.  In addition, a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule shall also be included in the submission.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.   The RFI does not guarantee award of any BPA in any or all domain(s).   Vendor submissions will be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firm's pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.    Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 08 June 2010.   Responses will be due NLT 09 July 2010, inclusive of teaming arrangements, unless otherwise stated in the formal solicitation.  Competitive selection and award of BPAs is anticipated to occur NLT 01 September 2010.   RFI responses can be mailed to the following address:   COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM CODE ACSS Attn George Herndon, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.    Responses submitted by FED-EX or UPS should be sent to the following address Mr. George Herndon, Code ACSS, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  Information provided may be used in a future solicitation.  
Only offerors who respond to this RFI and whose responses are determined to be the most highly rated will be provided a copy of the solicitation.  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXISTING CEOSS PRIME VENDORS:   To reconstitute teaming relationships on your existing CEOss BPA, you are required to submit the following information:  An initial letter of intent (LOI), limited to two (2) pages, that discusses changes to team members, your ability to meet prescribed competition thresholds, discounting policy, and rationale for the new team to continue to support MCSC programs.   This must be submitted NLT 28 APR 2010.   Revised proposals are due in accordance with the schedule on ACSS web site.   This must be accompanied by a copy of your selected team members' GSA Schedule, and single, updated MS Excel spreadsheet of all of the GSA rates for your team from September 2010-September 2012 (including rates from existing GSA team schedules).   Do not submit this in .pdf format; it must be a single .xls file with one rate schedule per worksheet.   Existing BPAs will be bilaterally modified to update labor rates (Attachment C) and to incorporate any additional terms and conditions.  Additional guidance will be issued to incumbent vendors at a later date. All responses from existing CEOss Prime Vendors shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:    acss@usmc.mil.   Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted electronically to the ACSS Office at acss@usmc.mil.

<CONTACT>Sarah H BasilottoContract Specialist732-578-5463

<a href="mailto:sarah.basilotto@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Request for InformationPKI Mature ServicesThis Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain market research only.  The purpose is to collect information about organizations with proven expertise in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solutions.  Information gathered from this RFI will help VA to mature its PKI capabilities within the organization.  It is not VA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential.  It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. BackgroundDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a large and complex PKI environment along with complex PKI needs for the business.  VA believes that these needs can only be adequately met by using very mature PKI capabilities via the approaches of auto-enrollment, user self service, and certificate lifecycle management.  Because VA is a federal agency all PKI solutions for VA must comply fully with the Federal PKI Policy Authority's Common Policy.  The full text of Common Policy can be found at http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkipa/documents/CommonPolicy.pdf.  All potential solutions for VA's PKI environment must be provided by a PKI shared service provider. A complete list of currently approved shared service providers can be found at http://www.idmanagement.gov/fpkipa/cpl.cfm.   VA is a large organization with a large number of end entities.  VA also has a very large and mature Active Directory infrastructure.  VA Active Directory and PKI managers believe that a successful solution must be very tightly integrated with Active Directory and that the solution must instantiate the issuing CA's on Windows Server 2008 R2 servers which are joined to VA's Active Directory forest.   Scope/ObjectivesThe Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking an IT solution that meets VA's needs for auto-enrollment, user self service, and certificate lifecycle management.  VA intends to meet these needs by having  four (4) Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 servers act as issuing CAs subordinate to  the chosen SSP's principle CA (PCA), these issuing CA's will be joined to the VA Active Directory forest. VA intends to achieve the goals of auto-enrollment, user self service, and certificate lifecycle management by using the rich set of PKI policy templates, group policy, and Microsoft's Certificate Lifecycle Manager.  Technical Elements:A vendor's solution would necessarily have the following characteristics:1.	 Non-Personnel entity certificates (NPE)a.	Issues subordinate certification authority certificates to the VA Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 CA's identified earlier, for the purpose of issuing non-personnel entity certificates (NPE).b.	Issuing CA's will exist on VA's premise, within the VA network boundaries.c.	Delivers a feasible approach to ensure that the solution will successfully satisfy all Common Policy requirements and vendor-specific auditing and Certification & Accreditation requirements.  The approach must address any additional complexities introduced into the system by the following:i.	VA's requirement that the issuing CA(s) is/are joined to VA's Active Directory forestii.	Implications of Active Directory membership of issuing CA(s) for logical access to the issuing CAs and any segregation of duties to be identified.iii.	Any complexities regarding physical access should the technical approach choose to locate the issuing CA's on VA premises for the purposes of high availability and low latency.  RFI ResponseThis request for information is used for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.  If interested please submit a capabilities statement that addresses the following:1.	Vendor Name and Address2.	DUNS Number, socio-economic status of company, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) 3.	Responder Point of Contact Name, Phone number, email address4.	Responses to the Technical Elements, Numbered as shown above. 5.	Optional Narrative: 1000 words or less to address any other issues to be communicated to VA not explicitly addressed in the response framework above.Upcoming Events:	Vendor Day tentatively schedule to take place in late April or early May 2010. Please monitor the FBO website for exact date and location. The information will be posted as it becomes available.  	Response Instructions:	Responses are requested no later than close of business on April 22, 2010.  The Point of Contact for responses is Sarah Basilotto, Department of Veterans Affairs Technology Acquisition Center, Phone 732-578-5463, Email sarah.basilotto@va.gov .

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract for a six-month period.  The Fort Hood Directorate of Contracting intends to enter into a non-competitive interim contract with the incumbent contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems Corp., 12900 Federal Systems Park Dr, Fairfax, VA  22033-4421, for the period of 1 Jul  31 Dec 2010.  The incumbent is a large business under NAICS 561210, Facilities Support Services (Small Business Size Standard is $35.5M).  The contract action calls for the contractor to provide all resources and management necessary to perform range operations, management of Government furnished property, equipment maintenance and repair, ground repair, Automated Data Processing (ADP) and digital range target repair and support services at Fort Hood, Texas. The resultant contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract.  The current contract expires on 30 June 2010 and the service is critical to sustainment of performance during the procurement of the follow-on contract action.  Award of this interim contract to another contractor would entail a significant effort to phase-in, inventory and inspect a significant amount of government furnished property, and acclimate to the Fort Hood optempo.  It is therefore determined that there is the likelihood that a new contractor would suffer undue risk attempting to manage phase in and provide continued high level contract support, making the attempt costly and inefficient for all parties.  Firms are requested to submit any questions/concerns regarding this non-competitive interim contract directly to the contract specialist at e-mail address: mark.ramey@us.army.mil and copy furnish the contracting officer at email address: susheep.oden@us.army.mil no later than 30 April 2010 at 2:00 p.m. CDT.

<DESC>Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP)<BR>W900KK-10-R-0034<BR>Request for Information #5<BR><BR>15 April 2010<BR><BR><BR>Closing Date: 29 April 2010<BR><BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS); Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) in partnership with the Yuma Test Center (YTC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR),  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), and Redstone Test Center (RTC) will be creating a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) Time Space Position Information (TSPI) object model for the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP).  PM ITTS is the lead for this capability and is seeking industry information and input on data attributes to be included in the Instrumentation Radar TENA TSPI object model.   <BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>The Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) developed a common architecture and requisite software to integrate testing, training, simulation, and high-performance computing technologies, distributed across many facilities. Through the establishment of a common architecture, the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), reuse and interoperability of range assets will be tremendously improved, thus reducing range development, operation, and maintenance costs.<BR><BR>TENA promotes interoperability and reusability among DoD ranges, facilities, and simulations and advances a simulation-based acquisition or a distributed engineering plant methodology to streamline weapon system acquisition. Once the TENA capabilities are in use by the test and training communities, future inter-range operations, as well as instrumentation development and sustainment, will cost less and incur less risk. Most impressively, upgrading an existing range system to TENA takes only a few days, drastically shorter than traditional software integration efforts. Additional benefits from the TENA products include cost-effective replacement of unique range protocols, enhanced exchange of mission data, and organic TENA compliant capabilities.<BR><BR>More information can be found on TENA at http://www.tena-sda.org.<BR><BR>This object model will be used for instrumentation radars in the close-in and fly-out zones of the Range Radar Replacement Program.<BR><BR>The Governments intention is to better understand what additional information would be beneficial for the Instrumentation Radar TSPI object model.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  There is no limit on your formal white paper submission including cover letter and white paper.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments that consists of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.  Electronic responses shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format.  Please submit responses to PEOSTRI, ATTN: SFAE-STRI-KOT (Mrs. Marialyn Achille-Argaez), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or e-mail m.achilleargaez@us.army.mil . Please include Mr. Anthony Aldrich, Project Director ( anthony.j.aldrich@us.army.mil ) on the cc:line.  Information must be received no later than 11:59 P.M. EDT 29 April 2010.  Point of contact is Mrs. Marialyn Achille-Argaez at 407 208-3481 or m.achilleargaez@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Detailed Requirements:<BR><BR>PM ITTS is looking for information and input on what additional data or attributes would be beneficial to contain in the TENA TSPI object model that will be used for instrumentation radars in the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP).  All respondents are asked to provide the following:<BR><BR>A technical description and reasoning for proposed changes or additions to the attributes of the sample TSPI object model below.<BR><BR><BR>Model Details<BR>Model Name:<BR>WSMR-TSPI-v1.0<BR>Summary:<BR>Please provide a brief description of this OM.<BR>Description:<BR>Please provide a detailed description of this OM.<BR>TDL File:<BR>models/WSMR/TSPI-v1.0/WSMR-TSPI-v1.0.tdl<BR><BR>File Contents<BR>Download<BR><BR><BR>1://thisistheWSMRTSPIformat<BR>2:<BR>3:packageWSMR<BR>4:{<BR>5:localclassTracking_Status<BR>6:{<BR>7:doublesvNumbers;//svnumbersusedinsolution.0=nosatelitesorsvPRN32.<BR>8:booleannonCoherentTrack;//1=non-coherenttrack<BR>9:booleandiffCorrectionsApplied;//1=theyareapplied<BR>10:booleancoherentTrack;//1=coherenttrack<BR>11:};<BR>12:<BR>13:localclassFigure_Of_Merit<BR>14:{<BR>15:booleanreceiverFault;//needsrepair<BR>16:booleanicdGps203Expire;//1=abouttoexpire<BR>17:booleanicdGps203InsuffData;//1=insufficientData<BR>18:booleanicdGps203ImproperData;//1=dataisimporper<BR>19:booleaniruAligned;//1=iruisaligned<BR>20:booleantrackerDown;//1=onetrackerdown<BR>21:booleannavFailure;//1=navigationfailure<BR>22:booleannavDegraded;//1=navigationdegraded-poorGDOPorinsufficientSVs<BR>23:doubleverticalEPE;//theverticalEPE<BR>24:doublehorizontalEPE;//theverticalEPE<BR>25:};<BR>26:localclassECEF<BR>27:{<BR>28:doublex;<BR>29:doubley;<BR>30:doublez;<BR>31:};<BR>32:<BR>33:localclassATTITUDE_ECEF<BR>34:{<BR>35:doubleroll;<BR>36:doublepitch;<BR>37:doubleheading;<BR>38:};<BR>39:<BR>40:localclassATTITUDE_RATE<BR>41:{<BR>42:doubleforward;<BR>43:doubleright;<BR>44:doubledown;<BR>45:};<BR>46:<BR>47:classTSPI_Data<BR>48:{<BR>49:doublemsgHeader;//2bytes<BR>50:doublegpsTime;//4*2=8bytes//estimatedgpstimeoftheweek.<BR>51:doublerecvId;//12bits//receiverserialnumber<BR>52:booleanaltHold;//1bit//true=altitudeholdmodeon<BR>53:booleanmethodFourCorrection;//1bit//true=methodfouriscorrected<BR>54:Tracking_StatustrackingStatusSig1;//1=1bytes//pleaseseelocalclassdefinitionabove<BR>55:Tracking_StatustrackingStatusSig2;//1=1bytes//pleaseseelocalclassdefinitionabove<BR>56:Tracking_StatustrackingStatusSig3;//1=1bytes//pleaseseelocalclassdefinitionabove<BR>57:Tracking_StatustrackingStatusSig4;//1=1bytes//pleaseseelocalclassdefinitionabove<BR>58:Figure_Of_MeritfigureOfMerit1;//2bytes<BR>59:Figure_Of_MeritfigureOfMerit2;//2bytes<BR>60:ECEFpositionECEF;//4*3=12bytes<BR>61:ECEFvelocityECEF;//4*3=12bytes<BR>62:ECEFaccelerationECEF;//2*3=6bytes<BR>63:ATTITUDE_ECEFattitudeECEF;//2*3=6bytes<BR>64:ATTITUDE_RATEattitudeRATE;//2*3=6bytes<BR>65:};<BR>66:};<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>1<BR>	<BR><BR>

In the event the Agency determines that a recording of the events is desirable for future use on its website, or in any other venue, the Agency reserves the right to provide and operate its own equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:</strong><em> <br /></em>The NLRB intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The objective of the NLRB is to select the&nbsp;quote that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the conference requirements covered in this solicitation. All evaluation factors and their relative importance are set forth in this solicitation. A site visit of the facility may be conducted prior to award. The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance. An integrated assessment of&nbsp;quotes using all evaluation factors found in the solicitation will be the basis for award. The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit&nbsp;quotes that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB. <br /><br /><strong><em>The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in proposals for which the Federal Government is exempt.</em></strong></p>
<p>All offerors must confirm in their proposal that the facility is compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire and Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) and the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-336)(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. A contractor can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or email at http://www.ccr.gov. A DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number is required in order to register.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong> <br />The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on the factors set forth below.&nbsp;Proposals that exceed the NLRB requirements may receive additional consideration under Technical Capabilities. These factors are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p><strong>1. Technical: <br />(a).</strong> Proposal will be evaluated for ability to provide all conference requirements, the ability to provide required services on the dates specified, and the size and layouts of meeting rooms and conference office space.<br /><strong>(b).</strong> Lodging Rooms: their size, layout, appearance, and amenities (e.g., no charge for local calls or use of internet/WIFI connections).<br /><strong>(c).</strong> Hotel Facilities/Meeting Room: The quality and appearance of the hotel facilities; the convenience of the general session and breakout rooms, location and office space; the atmosphere of the meeting rooms (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction, etc.); availability and quality of complimentary onsite parking, exercise facility and business center; cash bar and menu selections and A/V equipment.<br /><strong>(d).</strong> Location: Walking distance to a variety of restaurants, entertainment and shopping areas, commuting ease from major Airport, safety of hotel neighborhood, and located in Chicago, Illinois in the River North (Navy Pier), the Loop, or the Magnificent Mile area.</p>
<p><strong>2. Past Performance:</strong> <br />The contractor shall provide a list of three recent contracts that exemplify accomplished activities related to or similar to the activities identified in the SOW. The contact information for each reference shall include:<br />- Contract Value<br />- Agency/Company Name<br />- Type of Services Provided<br />- List of any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor's corrective action.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Price:</strong> <br />This price shall be realistic, fair and reasonable in comparison to same or similar services. Pricing shall be provided for the following contract line items (CLIN):<br /><br /><strong>CLIN 0001</strong> <br />Hotel Lodging for four nights for 180 in accordance with the Solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 002</strong> <br />Meeting Space Rental to include one administrative office; one general session room for 180 people; twelve break-out rooms for approximately 16 people in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 003</strong> <br />Food and Beverages - upgraded mid-morning beverage replenishment for five (5) days; upgraded afternoon refreshments for four (4) days; and an Awards Reception with upgraded Hor d'oeurves and a cash bar for 180 people Monday night all in accordance with the solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>CLIN 004</strong> <br />Audio Visual/Flipchart services - including equipment and dedicated technical support in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>CLIN 005</strong> <br />Miscellaneous Expenses - Parking for 40 cars in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p><em>All non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price; however, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, the proposed price may become the determining factor for award.</em></p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate&nbsp;quotes and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.</p>
<p>In case of a receipt of a large number of quotes, the evaluation team will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.</p>
<p>First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><br /><strong>a.</strong> If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br /><br /><strong>b.</strong> If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.</p>
<p>The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE SUBMISSION:<br /></strong>Quotes are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English.&nbsp;Quotes that do not follow the Price Proposal format and address the technical requirements or otherwise include documentation that is difficult to read, may be rejected or may result in a lower evaluation rating.</p>
<p>If a hotel contract is necessary, it shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams, and square footage and menus. Proposals must indicate whether the hotel agrees to the right of the NLRB to use its own audiovisual and computer equipment and, if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system or other charges connected to the use of own equipment.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Offeror shall submit a separate technical and cost&nbsp;quotes that address the requirements of this solicitation. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quotes are due by 4:00 p.m. EDT on April 30, 2010</strong> via email to Douglas Wolf at doug.wolf@nlrb.gov or by regular mail. Proposals should be submitted in either Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word. Proposals may be shipped or mailed to the following address:</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />WEB HOSTING <br />for<br />MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY<br />MINORITY ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT WEEK (MED WEEK) WEBSITE
<p><br />I. Background</p>
<p>a. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized by Executive Order 11625 to coordinate and develop public and private sector activities that advocate and assist in the development and growth of minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>b. The recognition of Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week began with a Presidential Proclamation in 1983 whereby one week, on an annual basis, the nation would celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of minority entrepreneurs. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, in collaboration with the U.S. Small Business Administration and other public and private sector partners, sponsors of the annual National MED Week Conference. Preceding the National MED Week Conference are (5) five Regional MED Week conferences sponsored by MBDA's regional offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. Many of MBDA's funded centers also host a MED Week event to recognize local minority business enterprises and to raise the Center's visibility as a resource for minority entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>c. The National MED Week Conference serves as a forum for presenting minority business development issues and accomplishments through plenary sessions, seminars, business opportunity fairs and other networking events. The Conference culminates with an Awards Gala which recognizes successful minority business enterprises, advocates and corporations for their outstanding contributions and support of minority business development. Past conferences have also included a youth track for about 50 students, a Business to Business Linkage Forum, an Access to Capital Networking session, a White House Reception and a Business EXPO.</p>
<p>The National MED Week Conference has gained the reputation as a high quality conference with prominent speakers, effective networking sessions, skill-building workshops and a growing audience. During the 3 to 3 &frac12; day event, over 1,000 people are in attendance. A contributing factor to this success is the medweek.gov website. The website is used as a marketing and promotions tool, a forum to communicate with stakeholders, a mechanism to enhance customer relations and a vehicle to increase the Agency's client base. It is critical that a reliable, cutting edge web hosting service provider is on board to host the medweek.gov website on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>II. Scope - The web hosting service contractor is responsible for providing the necessary personnel to perform the Work Requirements/Specifications of the Statement of Work during the performance period of the contract. The Agency wants to create a new, more user friendly, media rich website and requires web hosting services that support all MED Week activities. Reliable web hosting services are extremely critical during, after and three months prior to actual event date.</p>
<p>The Work Requirements and Specifications are provided in one primary area of responsibility: A. Website Hosting</p>
<p>III. Work Requirements</p>
<p>Web Hosting - to include the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>a. Provide a zero-downtime network infrastructure to support the traffic and content of the website<br />b.

Application:
To be installed as the upper layer of a two layer remote game fence.  The above wire fabric will be fastened to T-133 T-posts above a 48" tall game fence to bring the total height of the fence above 6'3".   It is designed to present a visual as well as physical barrier to feral sheep wanting to jump the fence.  The increased spacing between vertical stays keeps the fence light and lowers cost yet allows the fence to serve its purpose.   The extreme terrain makes handling of taller fence rolls very difficult and unsafe for personnel.  The protective coating must be of premium quality to withstand extreme exposure to SO2 and acid rain.

<DESC>General Background:<br />Historic nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) produced radionuclide contamination of the surface and near-surface soils. The Environmental Restoration Soils Project of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Safety Administration/Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) has the mission to characterize sites of near-surface soil contamination. <br />One component of the characterization of soils sites is the performance of GPS-assisted gamma walkover surveys to map the relative contaminant concentrations and distributions. The size of a site can vary from a low of several hundred square-meters to an area in excess of 10 million square-meters. The large area involved, in some sites, necessitates a shift towards a vehicle-born system to improve efficiency and to allow larger areas to be investigated.<br />Working Environment:<br />Topography:<br />The NTS lies on the transition between the Mojave and Great Basin Deserts. The areas to be surveyed vary from dry lake beds to high volcanic plateaus. In some areas, erosion of the surrounding mountains has resulted in the accumulation of more than 1,000 feet of coarse alluvial and unconsolidated gravel deposits.<br />The requested survey equipment will be used in areas dense in vegetation of varying types and concentrations, including grasses, sagebrush and creosote. Joshua trees and Yucca are present but will be avoided during the surveys.<br />Weather:<br />During the summer months, the climate is arid with limited precipitation, low humidity, large daily temperature ranges, and intense solar radiation. The highest maximum temperature measured on the NTS is 115oF and the coldest minimum temperature measured -14oF. <br />Altitude:<br />2,700 feet to 7,680 feet above mean sea level.<br />Radiation Levels:<br />Near the historic ground zeros of above-ground nuclear tests, typical radiation levels can vary from a background of 10 micro-roentgens per hour to levels of 250 micro-roentgens per hour. Surveys in such high levels are not generally necessary. The typical working environment is 10 to 60 micro-roentgens per hour.<br />Contaminants of Concern:<br />After many years of radioactive decay, the remaining predominant radionuclides to be investigated utilizing the proposed survey equipment:<br />&bull; Cs-137<br />&bull; Eu-154<br />Plutonium contamination (with the attendant Am-241 contaminant) may be present at some sites, but will be investigated with other survey equipment.<br />Required Capabilities:<br />Physical:<br />A complete, "turn-key" system is required, with the exception of a four wheel-drive vehicle, which will be provided by the system user. <br />The system shall be mounted on a wheeled or tracked trailer that can be towed, using a standard ball hitch. The trailer and radiation detector array shall have adequate clearance and/or design features to pass over or through typical sagebrush and creosote bushes. The combination of tires, or tracks trailer clearance, and trailer suspension should be able to accommodate undulating terrain, large gravel, and the ephemeral streams which are common to the NTS. <br />If tires are used, they should be easily removed and replaced under field conditions and must be able to accommodate the desert environment. A spare tire shall be provided with the trailer.<br />Maintaining a very short wheel base between the front of the towing vehicle and the rear of the trailer shall be emphasized. For planning purposes, the design can assume that a Polaris Ranger four-wheel drive vehicle will be utilized, although the design should accommodate a wide array of vehicle possibilities.<br />The system shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be contained on the trailer. Power may be obtained from the vehicle. The display of survey route and track information shall be designed for temporary mounting in the vehicle cab. If electronics are required to be carried in the vehicle, the components shall be designed to be portable, rugged, self-contained, with a minimum of components and connectors.<br />Radiation detectors must be rugged and reliable. Detectors shall be mounted approximately 12 to 16 inches above the working ground surface, although a larger distance may be proposed if detection capabilities are not severely compromised. The detector array should cover a width of approximately 36 to 48 inches in a single pass (i.e., approximately the width of the towing vehicle). Detectors shall be enclosed in a weather-resistant housing that is capable of withstanding routine contact with vegetation. Radiation detectors must be able to tolerate prolonged exposure to direct desert sunlight and heat while contained within protective enclosures.<br />If computer equipment is required for the stand-alone system, Dell is the established standard with Windows XP; wireless, camera and microphone are not permitted.<br />Radiological:<br />The system shall be capable of collecting detector array gross count-rate and geophysical position information data. Isotopic discrimination and/or the setting of photon energy windows are not needed. <br />The radiation detection system design shall focus on the detection of Cs-137 and Eu-154 contamination in soil. The system design goal is an adequate sensitivity to be able to reliably detect a 1m2 spot of Cs-137 surface soil contamination at approximately 50 pico-curies per gram. Performance testing and certification is not required. Other design sensitivities may be proposed.<br />GPS:<br />The system shall collect geophysical position information via GPS with 1 meter accuracy or better. The position data shall be capable of differential correction. The GPS system shall be an integral part of the overall radiation detection system. GPS equipment may be mounted on the trailer and display may be routed to the vehicle cab.<br />Automatic data-logging of the position information and output of the radiation detector array shall occur at 1 second intervals. Data storage shall be capable of reliably logging at least 4 continuous hours of information. The ability to easily start and stop data logging from the vehicle cab is highly desirable. <br />GIS:<br />GPS and radiation detector data must be compatible with ESRI ArcGIS 9 Geographical Information System (GIS) products.<br />Submittals:<br />To facilitate a complete and thorough technical evaluation of proposals, it is imperative that preparation and technical submittals be in accordance with headings outlined in this specification. Pictures, design drawings and cut sheets of proposed turn-key system are required for evaluation. It is necessary that the proposal contains specific details on product being offered. Provide three complete sets of the proposed turn-key system. This will enable NNES to perform a thorough technical evaluation.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as an invitation to Request for Quotations (RFQ) incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39. This is total small business set-aside procurement. The Small Business size standard is $7.0. The NAICS is 811310. The contract will be awarded in accordance with provisions of FAR 13.5. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: Solicitation/Contract number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and Solicitation Closing Date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half Street, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593. Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Consecutive seasons of failed rains, a rapidly growing population, increased inflation, endemic poverty, and limited government capacity have led to chronic food insecurity and water shortages in large areas of Ethiopia, including Somali Region and parts of Oromiya, Afar, Tigray, Amhara, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) regions. Populations in many areas of the country confront significant humanitarian challenges, including conflict, malnutrition, and delayed food deliveries. In Somali Region, insurgent activity and security operations have disrupted trade networks, and restrictions on the movement of people and livestock, combined with the failure of past rains, have exacerbated food insecurity.</p>
<p>In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, OFDA provided over $96 million in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, supporting programs in nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene, agriculture and food security, health, and economic recovery and market systems. OFDA also provides support to facilitate international humanitarian coordination and information management, promote disaster risk reduction, and enhance logistical support and access for humanitarian agencies operating in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires willingness to travel outside of Addis Ababa on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Ethiopia, as well as for disaster risk reduction programs. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Ethiopia Mission, the US Embassy, other U.S. Agencies as appropriate, international organizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the United Nations (UN), to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) in Nairobi, Kenya, OFDA Washington, and USAID/Ethiopia and U.S. Embassy/Ethiopia, as required.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy, other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, the Federal Democratic Government of the Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE), U.S. military representatives, as well as with relevant United Nations (UN) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for East and Central Africa and in consultation with USAID/Ethiopia, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Ethiopia for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and other U.S Agencies, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in Ethiopia. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant USPSC and foreign national program staff within the Addis Ababa OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in Ethiopia. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/ECARO on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate closely with OFDA/ECARO, the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, other U.S. agencies, and military representatives as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Ethiopia.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of GFDRE activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to humanitarian protection. Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent USG humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GFDRE, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington, as necessary. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for East and Central Africa (ECARO). However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Ethiopia, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. Embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for ECARO will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<DESC>****************************************************************************<br />Questions and Answers Modification #1<br /><br />(Q) Can you state what the cables and wiring would be used for?&nbsp;<br />(A) The cables and adapters will be used to interconnect microwave equipment operating between 1.7-8.5GHz<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;Please clarify which male connector is called out on the three items below:<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 24"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 36"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 48"<br /><br />(A) All will be SMA Male to SMA Male RG-142 in 24, 36, 48 inches<br /><br />(Q) No RF specifications are called out. Parts such as N and SMA connectors come in several grades. &nbsp;One is a low grade good to a few GHz, then comes the standard grade good to 12 GHz, and then there is the high precision grade good to 18GHz. &nbsp;There is a big price difference between them. Based on the cables called out you are interested in the "standard" grade, but there are lots of vendors that will quote the lower grade. &nbsp;The same goes for the SMA 90 Degree, there is a sharp version good to 6GHz and then the radius bend good to 18 GHz<br /><br />(A) The FBI is seeking RF connectors and adapters in the standard grade, good to 12Ghz brass construction. &nbsp;As for the 90 degree SMA adapters, the FBI will accept the sharp turn type.<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;The enduser might want to consider using RG400 instead of RG-142, the electrical specifications are the same. &nbsp;The difference is that RG400 has a stranded center conductor while RG-142 has a single silver plated steel center conductor. &nbsp;The benefit is increased flexibility.<br /><br />(A) The FBI is satisfied with the RG-142 type cable. &nbsp;The extra flexibility RG-400 gives is not critical nor significant.<br /><br />(Q) We don't think any vendor can supply all of these parts in 30 days. More realistic would be 1/2 in 30 days and all in 60 days.<br /><br />(A) &nbsp;The delivery time will be 60 days ARO (after receipt of order) with partial shipments accepted.<br />&nbsp;

****************************************************************************<br />Questions and Answers Modification #1<br /><br />(Q) Can you state what the cables and wiring would be used for?&nbsp;<br />(A) The cables and adapters will be used to interconnect microwave equipment operating between 1.7-8.5GHz<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;Please clarify which male connector is called out on the three items below:<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 24"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 36"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 48"<br /><br />(A) All will be SMA Male to SMA Male RG-142 in 24, 36, 48 inches<br /><br />(Q) No RF specifications are called out. Parts such as N and SMA connectors come in several grades. &nbsp;One is a low grade good to a few GHz, then comes the standard grade good to 12 GHz, and then there is the high precision grade good to 18GHz. &nbsp;There is a big price difference between them. Based on the cables called out you are interested in the "standard" grade, but there are lots of vendors that will quote the lower grade. &nbsp;The same goes for the SMA 90 Degree, there is a sharp version good to 6GHz and then the radius bend good to 18 GHz<br /><br />(A) The FBI is seeking RF connectors and adapters in the standard grade, good to 12Ghz brass construction. &nbsp;As for the 90 degree SMA adapters, the FBI will accept the sharp turn type.<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;The enduser might want to consider using RG400 instead of RG-142, the electrical specifications are the same. &nbsp;The difference is that RG400 has a stranded center conductor while RG-142 has a single silver plated steel center conductor. &nbsp;The benefit is increased flexibility.<br /><br />(A) The FBI is satisfied with the RG-142 type cable. &nbsp;The extra flexibility RG-400 gives is not critical nor significant.<br /><br />(Q) We don't think any vendor can supply all of these parts in 30 days. More realistic would be 1/2 in 30 days and all in 60 days.<br /><br />(A) &nbsp;The delivery time will be 60 days ARO (after receipt of order) with partial shipments accepted.<br />&nbsp;<br />Modification #2**************************************************<br />Please note that all&nbsp;lengths are 12, 24, 36 and 48 inches as noted.

<DESC>Question- For the 1.7mm sample tubes if a contractor has a number of solutions for small volume or sample limited experiments.
<p>Can you find out what "sample volume" the end user expects to need?</p>
<p>Answer: Should the vendor have more than one type of inverse detection probe designed for 1.7 mm tubes, then the probe that should be quoted is the one that offers the highest signal to noise (S/N) specifications for 1H NMR on a sample mass basis. Only room temperature probes (and not cryoprobes) should be quoted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is April 30, 2010 at 3:00 P.M., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about May 5,&nbsp;2010.

<DESC>CIMTIC III provide for urgent development and modification of AAC C4I and munitions test and evaluation (T&amp;E) systems and facilities under the responsibility of the 46th Test Wing's Range Group. The contract is intended to meet customer test requirements that cannot be timely met by a separate procurement action. The capabilities for rapid response, surge capacity and flexibility to unforeseen events are critical requirements to meet the short lead-time and dynamic test requirements inherent in the testing of modern weapon systems and rapidly changing defensive technologies and tactics. In support of this objective a high level of technical expertise is required in system analysis, system engineering, and in particular, continuous participation in the technological evolution of C4I, munitions, directed energy (DE), and other T&amp;E systems, facilities, and infrastructures necessary to keep pace with corresponding technological advances in advanced state-of-the-art C4I, smart munitions, surveillance, reconnaissance, and Electronic Combat (EC) systems as required to satisfy future AAC customer needs and requirements. In addition, this contract will provide AAC with T&amp;E systems, facilities, and infrastructure which support the implementation and realization of the C4I Test Process (AF Manual 99-111), Munitions Test Process (AF Manual 99-104), and EC Test Process (AF Manual 99-112). Thus, this contract will support development/ modification/upgrades to digital simulation models (DSMs), hardware in-the-loop (HITL) test facilities, measurement facilities, installed system test facilities (ISTFs), open-air range (OAR) facilities, and networked test facilities. Other areas requiring a high level of technical expertise include test engineering and analysis; test support hardware and software design, development, modification, fabrication, calibration, and integration and test transition support for sub-systems/systems/test facilities/infrastructure/networks, and supportability planning, installation, and training.

<DESC>The goals of the MAR program are to develop and demonstrate morphing rotor technology and demonstrate the dramatic benefits possible using this capability. The MAR program seeks to: 1) develop a robust design for a morphing rotor system that maximizes military utility by reconfiguring the system; 2) mature critical enabling technologies; and 3) validate through simulation, ground test and flight demonstration that rotor adaptation and morphing is feasible, practical, of military value, and sufficiently mature for application to the next U.S. military rotorcraft development effort.

<p>It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).</p>
<p>FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.&nbsp; Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.&nbsp; Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities. This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Iroquois Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification has been awarded on April 15, 2010.</p>

<p>FAR Part 6.302-1 provides that a sole source award is authorized when the required supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.&nbsp; Center operators are awarded contracts to operate Job Corps Centers through a competitive solicitation process.&nbsp; Center operators are in the unique position, as the only responsible source, to coordinate the necessary changes required by this sole source awarded modification. As the only responsible source, they are expected and contractually required to provide relevant and rigorous training curricula, training equipment and to maintain the facilities.</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; Earth Day Every Day, to assist with preparation and execution of the week's activities. This budget has been allocated to center operators from ARRA funds and should only be used to purchase activity supplies outlined in the booklet referenced in PIN 09-33, as well as to procure a tree and tree marker for the center.&nbsp; The operator of the Glenmont Job Corps Center will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification has been awarded on April 15, 2010.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: Demolition and disposition of Building K-33 disposition includes: mobilization and demobilization, transite siding removal, building demolition to the slab; and packaging and transportation of all associated wastes to onsite waste disposal facilities operated by DOE.
<p>The K-33 facility is a partially decontaminated and degraded multi-story building located in the northwest corner of the ETTP. It encompasses more than 1.4 million square feet and is primarily constructed of concrete and steel, with most of the exterior covered by corrugated transite. The facility was constructed in 1954 as a uranium enrichment facility and was operated from 1954 to 1985. Today, the K-33 facility still contains radiological and chemical contamination, hazardous wastes, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyl's (PCB) contamination. DUNS 192272396</p>
<p><br />Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>To reduce the time it would take to procure the required services DOE awarded this task order under the existing EM Nationwide Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts.-These contracts help to stream line the competitive acquisition process and minimize the time it takes to procure the required services than if they were procured under full and open competition.</p>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), specifically the Office of Water, Office of Groundwater Drinking Water, Water Security Division (OG/OGWDW/WSD) requires an increase in the ceiling capacity of Contract EP-C-05-045 during Option Period IV in an amount of 20,000 hours level of effort. Increasing the capacity of the contract by this amount will put the ceiling of the contract for Option Period IV in line with the actual utilized contract levels in the previous four contract periods. The contract had originally been solicited and awarded with a bell-curve expectation (ramping up in the Base Period, straight-line for the next three periods, and ramping down in the final period), but subsequent events following that award have demonstrated that the contract should have been structured with consistent contract capacity in each of the option periods. Option Period IV is the final period on the contract. In order to issue all anticipated work assignments for Option Period IV, all available quantity option amounts have already been exercised.
<p>The contract provides technical support services of a unique nature for the WSD mission needs, and also provides critical support services to other Offices of the EPA [Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Emergency Management (OEM) effort; National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) efforts, including Methods Development and Security Products Assessment and Review efforts]. Without having sufficient capacity available for OEM on this contract, its very high priority, high visibility requirements would be severely impacted, jeopardizing the progress toward carrying out homeland security directives.</p>
<p>The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, an increase to the level of effort for this contract. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and FAR 6.302.1 which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source. The basis for this determination is that only Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), the incumbent, can provide the continuity to complete the remaining complex technical work. The requirements are in sensitive stages of development, and abandoning the efforts at this point for lack of capacity would not be a reasonable option. Likewise, the time required to solicit a new contractor and allow that contractor to get up to speed on the requirements in the middle of a project would not be cost effective or efficient. In addition, the contract includes specific capabilities for secret and/or sensitive work, which is not common on other Agency contracts already in place. Furthermore, the analysis type effort for various highly sensitive contaminants is also unique on this contract, and is able to support the type of method development that NHSRC is working toward.</p>
<p>A synopsis has been posted for a full and open competition for follow-on performance after the completion of the existing contract. The follow-on acquisition is scheduled for award no later than July 31, 2010. For additional information see the synopsis posting on the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov or at the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division website http://www.epa.gov/oamcinc1/0910342/coverpg.htm under Mission Support for Water Security Division (PR-CI-09-10342). Please monitor these web sites for additional information concerning this procurement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</span></strong> Sources wishing to be considered must submit documentation to the office identified above which establishes that (1) the company has the expertise to meet the contract technical requirements; (2) it has a Top Secret facility clearance; (3) it has the facilities, equipment, and personnel available; and (4) a mobilization plan demonstrating an ability to immediately step in and assume the duties under this contract without any delays, disruptions, or impact on the quality of the work effort. Documentation should be submitted within 15 days of this notice. See notes 22 and 26.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONDUE TO SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT1.  REQUIRING ACTIVITY: Sitka National Cemetery, 803 Sawmill Creek Road, Sitka, AK 998352.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  NCA-CCD, 75 Barrett Heights Rd., Suite 309, Stafford, VA 225563.  PROPOSED ACTION:  Sole Source Procurement for Cemetery Operations for one month to current SDVOSB vendor.4.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: All Cemetery operations for remote cemetery in Alaska, to include interments and grounds maintenance/janitorial service. 5.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  P.L. 109-461 Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (Veteran's First Contracting), FAR part 6.302-5 Authorized or required by statute. 38 USC 8127(b).6.  NATURE OF ACQUISITION TO MEET THE AUTHORITY CITED IN PARAGRAPH 5: Current contract ends on April 1, 2010. New competition will not be complete until after the end date. Current contractor is a SDVOSB. Under Veteran's First Contracting, VA has authority to Sole Source to SDVOSB up to $5.5 Million, even if other companies are available.The company is in place and capable of providing service until new competition for contract is complete. 7.  DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONDUCT ANY MARKET RESEARCH TO LOCATE SOURCES: Searches were conducted on VetBiz and CCR websites. Research on current contractor shows positive past performance and status as a SDVOSB. 8.  CUSTOMER'S SUBMISSION OF PRICE ANALYSIS: Price is $21,000 per month.  The quoted price represents about 3% price over the government estimate.  9.  ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SUPPORT OF SUBMISSION: Current contractor is a SDVOSB. The company is in place and familiar with the needs. This allows for the easiest continuity of service for the brief period of this contract The managing cemetery is 700 miles away by air. In order to transition to a new contractor for one month the director would have to fly their while the current contractor packed up and the new contractor was put in place. This would put an undue burden on the Government. Extremely short period before service is needed.10.  LISTING OF ANY SOURCES (IF ANY) THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT:R & B Enterprises11.  FUTURE ACTIONS TO OVERCOME BARRIER TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  Procurement of future services for Cemetery Operations will be competed IAW FAR Subpart 6.2 and publicized IAW FAR Subpart 5. 12.  This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my belief and knowledge.							________________________							Brian Johnson							Contract SpecialistApproved By:______________________________Mary Moss, Contracting Officer_________________________Date
