<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center intends to award a non-competitive procurement to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc, 2003 Central Avenue, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001, for the statistical consulting services of Shay Howlin, Biometrician.  This work is for follow-on services to be provided for development of a survival and risk analysis that will identify factors contributing to elevated biomarkers of oil exposure and increased mortality rates in western Prince William Sound sea otters and for development of new analysis tools to predict locations of lingering oil, based on biomarker measurements in a suite of nearshore species.  Ms. Howlin has provided similar analysis of sea otter pup survival in 2002/2003.  Many factors that we require to be analyzed in this situation are the same or similar to those incorporated in the pup survival analysis.  Ms Howlin developed a statistical model then that can now be built upon to perform this analysis.  She also accumulated unique expertise in the vagaries of sea otter health indices and radio-tracking data that need to be dealt with before accepting results of statistical tests as valid.  Because of Ms. Howlin's expertise in these types of analyses, she was specifically identified in a court order as the biometrician to be contracted for the work in the study plan for this project, for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within ten days of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9339 or email vfriesner@usgs.gov.  A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Bosnia and Herzegovina in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a five-year program entitled the Governance Accountability Project, Phase II (GAP 2). 

Under the planned activity, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Netherlands Minister for development cooperation represented by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Bosnia and Herzegovina (EKN) seek to strengthen democratic local governance in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the implementation of this five-year program. Each donor has agreed to contribute $10 million over the five year life of project for a total of $30 million (subject to congressional and parliamentary appropriations).

GAP2 will provide demand-driven technical and material assistance to the 41 municipalities that have successfully participated in the original Governance Accountability Project (GAP 1). GAP2 will also select an additional 30 municipalities to receive core technical and material assistance, followed by demand-driven assistance.  In addition, GAP2 will provide targeted policy interventions in conjunction with mayors and municipal associations to improve the transparency, accountability and effectiveness of Bosnia-Herzegovina?s governance structures.  The Local Self-Governance Strategy, drafted by Bosnian mayors and policy experts, will form the basis for policy interventions.  Priority policy goals include Functional Decentralization (clearer definition of roles and responsibilities) and Fiscal Decentralization (predictable and adequate finances for service provision). Local ownership of GAP2 will rest primarily at the municipal level.  

The three bilateral donors of Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United States, have agreed to a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA) for GAP2. USAID will carry out procurement steps to competitively select an implementer, and will conduct contract administration on behalf of the three donors.  All three donors will be engaged in strategic management and oversight of GAP2.  Although USAID will have the direct relationship to the contractor and is charged with contract administration, the donor ownership over project strategy and implementation is equal and shared among the three donors.  

USAID anticipates making an award in the range of $22.5 to $23.5 million. Sida shall provide a side fund of $6.5 million to be entirely transferred by the contractor to municipalities for capital projects.  Following the award of this Request for Proposals, the selected implementer and Sida will conclude a financial agreement concerning the $6.5 million side fund. 

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Firms or organizations and subcontractors whose their source, origin and nationality is in countries party to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and the cooperating country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are eligible to compete. At this time, 37 countries, including European Union (EU) member states and the United States, are parties to the Agreement.
USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S and non- U.S. firms, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.

In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation is posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. 

Please do not contract USAID/BiH. All communication must be through this office. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) in collaboration with National Institutes of Justice (NIJ), and the Department of Defense (DoD) contemplates awarding a cost plus fixed fee contract to implement a population-based survey in all U.S. states and territories to generate national and state-level estimates of the prevalence and incidence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) and to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and consequences of IPV in the military and non-military populations. 

The project requires the contractor to conduct a population-based survey that will provide accurate and reliable estimates of the incidence and prevalence of IPV and SV and self-directed violence (SDV) at the national level and to the extent possible at state, regional and territory level.  The survey, that will assess both victimization and/or perpetration, will provide critical information about IPV and SV victimization and/or prevalence characteristics, circumstances, consequences, and help seeking behavior among English and/or Spanish speaking male and female adults (18 years and older).  Special consideration will be given to special populations for inclusion in the sample, specifically 1) all female members of the active duty component of the US Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy); 2) all female spouses of married male service members; and 3) over-sampling for American Indian and Alaskan Native women.  The contractor will work with CDC to incorporate feedback from an expert panel and the results of a pilot survey conducted during January through April 2007.

This effort is for a base year of 30 months with 4 options periods of 12 months each.  No determination for a set-aside has been made yet.  However, the Government will consider responses to this presolicitation notice in making a set-aside determination.  According, interested offerors are encouraged to submit a brief statement of capabilities relevant to this requirement and indicate their business status.  The NAICS code is 541990.  The solicitation is scheduled to be posted to fedbizops on or about 22 May 2007.  A hard copy solicitation will not be issued.  All responses shall be submitted via email to Ms. Vallerie Redd at gfj3@cdc.gov.   No telephone request/inquires will be accepted.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-12 Location and Connectivity Aware Content Pushing (LOCO).  CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov;  PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: NLT 1400, 12 April, 2007, POC: Tim Gibson, DARPA/STO; 3701 N. Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA, 22203-1704.  Email: BAA07-12@darpa.mil; Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicit/LOCO/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for LOCO.  The vision of the LOCO program is to provide information to commanders before they need it by anticipating their needs.  Current systems (e.g., file caches, peer-to-peer networks or Akamai-like systems) watch what users request and react by either moving data or shifting users to other data stores.  These techniques neither move the data beforehand nor work efficiently in bandwidth constrained military environments.  

DARPA requests proposals for two Technical Topic Areas supporting the LOCO program.  The first Topic Area covers the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  The second area deals with test and evaluation.  Proposers may not bid against both areas.  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered non-responsive to this BAA.

There will be a Proposer's Day starting at 8 am (0800), 27 February at the Executive Conference Center (ECC), 3601 Wilson Blvd, Suite 600, Arlington VA, 22201.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 07-12) not later than 2 pm (1400, local Arlington VA time), 12 April, 2007  

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Section 217 and PL 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA plus the associated Program Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute the full BAA and proposers must obtain and follow the details for submission set forth in the PIP.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Your proposal must indicate which Technical Topic Area it is submitted against.  Proposals submitted against Technical Topic Area 1 (developing an end-to-end system to provide LOCO capabilities) will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the following areas in descending order of importance:  technical approach; potential for proposed effort to meet program metrics; ease of transitioning proposed technology into Defense Department networks; potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA Mission; and cost reasonableness and realism.    

Proposals submitted against Technical Topic Area 2 (build, maintain, and operate a testbed to evaluate LOCO technologies against LOCO program metrics) will be evaluated on the merit and relevance as it relates to following areas in descending order of importance:  ability to build, maintain, and operate a testbed to evaluate LOCO technologies against LOCO program metrics; potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission; and cost reasonableness and realism.   

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be unclassified.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access these documents at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) SOL BAA 07-23, DUE: 26 March 2007; POC: Dr. Brian Leininger, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (571) 218-4529.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).

BACKGROUND:  
Finding, tracking and monitoring events and activities of interest on a continuous basis remains one of our highest Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements.  Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) including the Predator Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) serve as one of the warfighter's primary and most responsive means for surveillance and gathering intelligence information and are becoming vital assets in military operations.  This is demonstrated by their significant use in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  Lessons learned from these operations indicate that UAVs provide critical capabilities for enhancing situational awareness, intelligence gathering and force protection for our military forces.  Current UAS high-resolution electro-optics (EO) offer a narrow high-resolution field of view (FOV).  This narrow FOV is a limiting factor on the utility of the EO system.  The UAS that are available offer persistence; however, the effectiveness of the EO system is limited by the sensors and available processing.

ARGUS-IS will advance technologies and systems that will enable wide area persistent surveillance thereby provide greatly enhanced situational awareness to the warfighter. These technologies and systems will be transitioned to various partners and customers. Participants will work closely with the transition partners to aid in this process.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  
The objective of the ARGUS-IS program is to develop a system that provides a real-time, high-resolution, wide area video persistent surveillance capability and transition this capability to the military.  The ARGUS-IS program is seeking to provide an expanding range of capabilities enabling wide area persistent surveillance.  ARGUS-IS is composed of three major technology components/subsystems, a Gigapixel Sensor Subsystem, an Airborne Processing Subsystem and a Ground Processing Subsystem.  The ARGUS-IS Airborne Subsystem is formed by integrating the Gigapixel Sensor and Airborne Processing Subsystems together.  The packaging of the airborne subsystems should be compatible with a variety of UAS including Extended Range/Multiple Purpose (ER/MP), Aerostat, and A-160 (Hummingbird).  The ARGUS-IS system will be tested and evaluated during a series of flight experiments utilizing a surrogate UAV.  It is expected that a 200 megabit per second data link will be utilized for these flight experiments.  

The goal for first set of capabilities that are being developed is to provide multiple video windows within the field-of-view (FOV) that are being continuously imaged via a gigapixle sensor.  The desire is to transmit each video window to a user on the ground, which would look like a dedicated sensor within the gigapixel sensor's FOV.  The types of functionality for each of the video windows includes; operating at variable resolutions, variable update rates, electronically steerable video windows from anyplace within the system's FOV, have the ability to track a designated target within a window and keep the target within the video window's FOV.  Further functionality is envisioned through the addition of a moving target indicator (MTI) mode for vehicles.  In this mode the system will track all vehicles within the FOV.

The Government is interested in solutions to the following components/subsystems:

- Gigapixel Sensor: The Gigapixel Sensor is a complete subsystem containing the focal plane arrays, optics, gimbal, mechanical stabilization and a means of controlling where the sensor is pointed.
- Airborne Processing and System Integration: The Airborne Processing Subsystem takes the pixels produced by the Gigapixel Sensor and does all necessary image processing.  The Airborne Processing Subsystem consists of the airborne processing hardware, software, and data recording.  This effort also includes the integration of the airborne elements into an airborne subsystem and the integration of the airborne and ground subsystems.
- Ground Processing: The ground processing provides for the data link management system control and system information distribution.  The system software will operate in the server in conjunction with a set of distributed common clients to provide for integrated ground functionality that can be easily integrated into current and future warfighter ground station systems.

ARGUS-IS will be composed of three phases, the first phase is a design and component build phase, followed by a video window and moving target indicator phases.    At the discretion of the Government,  the initiation of later phases (i.e., Phases 2 and 3) is contingent upon the availability of funding and the Government's determination that system-level performance goals established for earlier phases were met.
- Phase I - Design and component build: During Phase 1, the design of the overall system and subsystems will be performed.  In addition, critical elements of the subsystems may be built.  This includes both critical hardware elements as well as software elements.
- Phase 2- Video Window Functionality: During Phase 2, the ARGUS-IS Subsystem build will be completed, the subsystems integrated together and the Video Window functionality will be demonstrated in a series of flight experiments.  It is expected that the first flight experiment will happen midway through this phase of the program.  At the end of this phase of the program, this functionality may be transitioned by DARPA to interested research, industrial, and operational military communities.
- Phase 3- Moving Target Indicator: During Phase 3, the MTI functionality will be integrated into the operational software and flight tests of this capability will take place.  

SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/ scientific/ business decision process, with technical and scientific considerations being most important. Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Technical Innovation and Depth; 
(2) Relevance to the ARGUS-IS Mission Objectives and Consistency with ARGUS-IS Program Concepts; (3) Cost Realism and Reasonableness; (4) Realism of Proposed Schedule; and (5) Personnel and Corporate Capabilities and Experience.  Further details may be found in the PIP, which can be accessed at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address provided in the next section.

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 07-23.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be submitted to - BAA07-23@darpa.mil.  Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted for public access at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0723 under the title Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)/Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation. .

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract for one (1) propelled floating platform to represent a Fast Target that is used in weapons testing.  Fast Target is a self-propelled target capable of simulating various threat scenarios while under remote control.  The government will design and install the remote control equipment.  This procurement is 100% set aside for small business (NAICS 336611, size standard is 1000 employees).  The Fast Target must meet specified design requirements and will be a minimum of 49 feet in length and must be capable of sustained speeds of 50 knots in fully-developed sea state two (10 knot wind with 2 to 3 foot seas).  For purposes of this procurement length shall be measured as the distance between the centerline of the top main deck, forward, and the after-most point on the hull measured on centerline.  Integral parts of the hull will be considered included in the measurement!   if the part extends both above and below the waterline.  Bolt-on hull extensions or bow pulpits will be excluded from the measurement of length.  The goal of the upcoming solicitation will be to procure a close derivative of a propelled floating target currently in production, which therefore requires minimal development.  Delivery will be F.O.B. Destination.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  Respond to Collin Kyte either by mail to Commander, Code 220000D, Attn: Collin Kyte, 429 E.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis the following items:  Airborn 9042203 coil cables and peripheral bomb interface components.  This requirement is sole sourced to Airborn, Inc., 4321 Airborn Dr., Addison, TX  75001, based on the fact that compatibility of bomb cable interfaces to aircraft and joint service platforms is critical to weapon functionality.

Airborn, Inc., owns the end cap technical data package and existing production tooling. The government will purchase engineering design services and prototype tooling needed to verify that the design solutions will correct the deficiencies. There are no direct replacement parts. The connectors are specific to the Mk80 series of general purpose bombs.  Market research has revealed there are no other sources of sup!  ply for these end caps.  Any firms believing that they can provide the 9042203 coil cables and peripheral bomb interface components, may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 5 days after the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to obtain access to a guinea pig model of infection to propagate large quantities of the human infectious Peruvian E. bieneusi isolate for use towards developing a complete detection method to monitor for this pathogen in drinking water systems. This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because, Dr. Vitaliano Cama of Departamento de Salud Animal y Salud Publica, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, Peru recently identified a Peruvian E.  bieneusi isolate that is infectious to guinea pigs as well as humans.  To date, this specific Peruvian E. bieneusi isolate found in guinea pigs has not been found anywhere else in the world, and is the only isolate identified that infects humans and guinea pigs.  To the best of our knowledge, Dr.  Cama and his colleagues at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos are the only group that has access to this isolate.  Dr. Cama and colleagues have developed a guinea pig infection model system that can provide large quantities of well characterized homogenous E. bieneusi spore that is  infectious to humans.    NAICS Code 541710 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned  data and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.   Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) is estimates of health spending for the United States produced by the National Health Statistics Group (NHSG) in the Office of the Actuary.  The NHEA is a matrix designed health spending account that summarizes health spending by major health service category as well as the major sources of funding for each service category.  Included in the source of funds for the NHEA are estimates for health spending under workers? compensation programs.  For purposes of more fully developing workers compensation data for the NHEA and evaluation the inclusion of workers? compensation data for the SHEA, the NHSG in the Office of the Actuary would like to purchase a state-level database of workers? compensation premiums and benefit expenditures.  The NHSG needs to obtain worker?s compensation premiums earned in 2005, as well as medical and cash benefits paid and incurred for injuries occurring in 2005 for each state.  The incurred cost data should include benefits paid and reserves set aside for future payments.  The data will be used to construct national source of funds estimates for workers? compensation in the NHEA.  The contractor must be engaged in the collection and tabulation of social insurance information, including workers? compensation data.  The data from the contractor will be used to update the National Health Accounts, and serves as an important element of Nest?s historical ?sources of funds? estimates.  The data is currently unavailable from any other source.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements, which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the requirements in the synopsis.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:

It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity.  Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers' ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non?military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.

Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.

Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised.  Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve.  A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.

Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities.  The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.

	Approximately 40% of DoD's RTD&E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase. 

	"The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements."  -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)

The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems. 

The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a "valley of disappointment" where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.  

The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research & Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle ? customers, researchers, engineers, and operators ? to collaborate and plan for transition. 

Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:

	Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments, 

	Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support and training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and 

	The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems. 

It is the intent of Software and Systems Test Track to help address all of the above issues.

Objective:

The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI).  The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems.  The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.  

The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed.  This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools.  Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.

The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure).  Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles.  SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.

   Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia and therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with this requirement.  Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access).  The CONOPS will be posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1.  Phase II will be the environmental development and operations phase.  

The environment should be open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators.  This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools.  Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available.  Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested in the loop allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment.  This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.

The Systems and Software Test Track should also provide a place (possibly virtual and not a single physical location) for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories.  The experimental platforms should incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms should be made accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research should include subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications.  This environment should provide a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations.  A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment.  The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.

Research Concentration Areas:

The primary goal of the Phase 2 research is to design and implement the Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) from the Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The SSTT will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.  To ensure a broad range of collaborators offerors need to provide details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT, including non-team participation and successful methods of collaboration used in the past.

The Architecture should provide the ability to understand and control those elements of system design that capture the system's utility, cost, and risk.  These elements could be the physical components of the system and their relationships, the logical components or enduring principles or patterns that create enduring structures.  The Architecture shall provide a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions and interfaces.

Areas to consider when developing the Architecture include, but are not limited to:

	The environment to host, execute and test technology, both hardware environment (run time platform) and software environment (run time platform)

	Details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT, including non-team participation and successful methods of collaboration used in the past

Interfaces and collaborations

Mechanisms to support research and analysis of DoD problems including, but not limited to: software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools

Data repositories for results, success stories, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results, software disaster studies defining problems and basic research areas, ability to upload/download artifacts

Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics

Metrics including reduced development time; ease in which domain experts and software engineers can interact; ease in which different domain experts can specify and design code independently of one another; usability, i.e., the 'naturalness' of the modeling language from which code is generated; ability of test engineers to modify and tune code in the field; accurate automated documentation in design

Mechanism for studying innovative systems and dynamic processes, not static snapshots

Populate, demonstrate, promote and improve the SSTT.  For the SSTT to be successful it must be populated with challenge problems, software producibility tools, collaboration tools, and administrative tools.

Anticipated Schedule:  

Phase 2, the Development and Operations phase, is anticipated to be a 4 year effort.  Phase 3, the Research and Operations phase, is expected to begin upon the completion of Phase 2.  Additional information will be provided as a modification to this BAA to initiate Phase 3.  This modification is anticipated to be issued in September 2009.

<DESC>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is conducting market research in order to deter-mine the capabilities of vendors to meet the requirements of the FCC?s financial system moderniza-tion initiative, which is known as the Core Financial System Replacement (CFSR) Project.  The FCC is interested in identifying viable sources and acquisition strategies for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) financial management software, system integration services, and application hosting ser-vices. The FCC plans to acquire all services and software through a single acquisition process that will result in the award of one contract.

The FCC plans to acquire the required software and services from an OMB designated federal gov-ernment shared service provider (SSP) or by placing an order with a commercial vendor. All soft-ware and services will be obtained though a single public-private competition that will result in the selection of one SSP or one prime commercial vendor. Selection of the service provider will be con-ducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget?s (OMB) memorandum, Competi-tion Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migrations, dated May 22, 2006, the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance [Version 1], dated September 13, 2006, and applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). An acquisition strategy has not yet been determined.
The intent of this market research announcement is to acquire information from interested parties to assist the FCC in developing an understanding of public and private sector capability, capacity, and experience in supporting the agency?s CFSR Project.  Therefore, in accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3), the FCC intends to use the results of this market research to determine if there are vi-able sources capable of satisfying the agency?s requirements and to determine if commercial items are available.  
The FCC will review all submissions received in response to this market research announcement.  Upon completion of the market research, the FCC anticipates finalizing the solicitation package, which will contain the following materials:
1.	A request for quote (RFQ) or request for proposal (RFP) containing a performance-based statement of work, instructions for the submission of technical and price proposals, evalua-tion criteria, information about required operational capability demonstrations, and applica-ble general terms and conditions
2.	A final version of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) document containing information about the FCC?s current and target financial business processes and its supporting technical environment, a draft of which is included with this notice
3.	A Systems Requirements Specification (SRS) document containing the functional and tech-nical requirements, consisting of applicable FSIO requirements and FCC-specific require-ments
Once an acquisition strategy has been selected, all quoters/offerors, whether from the public or pri-vate sector, will be required to submit a written technical proposal and a written price proposal. Based on the evaluation of technical proposals and price proposals, the FCC will invite selected of-ferors to demonstrate their ability to meet the FCC?s requirements in key areas through an opera-tional capability demonstration. After the operational capability demonstrations, the FCC will make the final offeror selection.
This presolicitation notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or to any follow-up information requests.
Hard copies of this notice are not available. 
This announcement contains two attached documents. Attachment 1 provides a market research questionnaire and instructions for its completion and submission.  The questionnaire is divided into sections based on the types of services that a respondent provides. Questions 1-12 are for applica-tion host providers.  Questions 13-21 are for systems integrators. Questions 22-29 are for software vendors.  Questions 30-31 are general availability questions. If a respondent can provide services in multiple areas, then they should respond to the questions in the applicable sections.  All respondents are asked to respond to Questions 30-31.  
Attachment 2 is a draft Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that provides information on the FCC?s current functional and technical financial operations environments.  The CONOPS also provides a high-level description of the envisioned financial operations environment once the new core finan-cial system has been implemented.  Vendors are also encouraged to activate the e-mail notification feature of FedBizOpps in order to receive notification of any additional postings for this an-nouncement.   
Responses shall be provided in three (3) hardcopies and include one electronic version on a compact disc (CD) formatted in Microsoft Word.

Of equal importance is to enhance the output of the IRS Post-of-Duty Model (i.e., information IRS considers when reviewing and establishing office locations) by determining building inventory via zip code searches, and by establishing location criteria (i.e., a delineated area).  This function requires that the web-based system be compatible with the IRS Post-of-Duty Model system and be able to interact with it as described below. 

The contractor shall provide access to an existing and well-established web-based database that provides accurate, current and comprehensive data that includes commercial real estate market information for a minimum of fifty (50) markets and sub-markets and which identifies available commercial space, types of space, historical real estate data, vacancy rates, photographs, maps and floor plans, hereafter ?market data,? for major U.S. metropolitan markets and their sub-markets.  This data must be as current and as real-time as possible given the dynamic, subjective nature of real estate information.  This will include twenty (20) users located nationally, with the potential to add additional users throughout the term of the contract.    

In order for the database to be useful, it must be well-established and have a transactional and market history of a minimum of ten (10) years. This is critical to identify patterns and trends and for verifying and appealing General Services Administration (GSA) rental rates. Additionally, to ensure the quality of the data being collected, researched and utilized in the database, the company supplying the database should have a direct field research operation involving direct inspection of properties and contact with brokers, owners and other commercial real estate professionals.

Additionally, the IRS engages in a proprietary location modeling process to determine the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.  During the location modeling process, the IRS utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and will consider the market data output from the procured web-based service.  The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial inventory by zip code.  Further, property searches shall be conducted by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database, which shall provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area. This requires that the web-based service be able to report in terms compatible with these components of the IRS location modeling program, focusing on small sub-markets within an area.  For additional information on the IRS POD Model go to: http://www.irs.gov/privacy/article/0,,id=131238,00.html

Additionally, the web-based service shall allow IRS employees to analyze current and historical market conditions; verify building specific lease terms and conditions, i.e., asking rental rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions; building specific images (floor plans, and exterior and interior building photos); and new construction information.  The information presented shall be timely.  Real-time data is essential.

The contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users understand the web-based product?s capability.  The contractor shall provide ongoing customer support for the term of the contract to answer questions, troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.  This shall be achieved via online demonstrations or through call sites.  This customer service shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST.

The period of performance is for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.

Interested parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit a written capability statement and provide trial access to your database with the submission of your written capability statement.   Responses will be accepted by e-mail to Kathy.M.Pham@irs.gov or Darlene.C.Walls@irs.gov by 11:00 AM EST on the date specified (May 15, 2007).  The reference number for this announcement is D-7-D9-01-RE-A20 000.   A determination by the Government not to compete with  this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No award will be made on the basis of any quotations/proposals or other information received in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Denton Vacuum, Incorporated, of Moorestown, New Jersey, for the acquisition of a Sputtering System to be used by the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the system to be identical to another system currently in the CNST.  The NIST CNST Nanofab is a NIST-wide multi-user facility that provides hands-on access to state-of-the-art Nanofabrication equipment and processes to researchers of all levels of knowledge from novice to expert. The tools within the facility are used by the researchers on a pay-by-use basis. The facility currently houses a sputter system from Denton Vacuum Inc. which has been heavily used since the facility was opened in November 2005. This heavy use has introduced a bottleneck since the tool can only handle one operation per run. To overcome this bottleneck condition, it is required that NIST purchase another identical system.  Denton Vacuum is the only contractor who has shown the capability needed to manufacturer the required sputter system.

Denton Vacuum, Incorporated, is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required system.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333994, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by May 24, 2007 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Advanced Measurement Technology (ORTEC), of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for the acquisition of a Coaxial N-Type HPGe Gamma-Ray Detector to be used in the Ionizing Radiation Division at NIST.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the detector to be a direct replacement of existing equipment currently in the laboratory.  This equipment is being purchased to access performance differences between new technology (digital electronics) and old technology (analog electronics) and replace existing instrument.  For this reason, the same detector type provided by the same manufacturer must be acquired for performance comparison and instrument replacement.  The existing NIST system is composed of ORTEC high purity germanium (HPGe) detector and electronics that is connected to a personal computer with ORTEC software to ensure system compatibility.  To be able to integrate and use the existing data acquisition system, it is required to purchase the new system from ORTEC.  ORTEC is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required detector.  .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The primary purpose of this proposed contract is to provide Technical Review and related engineering support for the proposed cutoff wall for the Herb ert Hoover Dike project, located around Lake Okeechobee, Florida.  These services are to be performed during the Design Phase, Solicitation Phase, and Construction Phase of the project.  During the Design Phase services may include, but not limited to revi ewing documents, providing comments, and attending meetings; during the solicitation phase services may include, but not limited to providing expert opinion on construction methodology, assist in developing responses to contractor inquiries and conceptual input on solicitation amendments; during the construction phase services may include, but not limited to review of submittals, engineering during construction, answering requests for information.  This contract will not be open for use outside the geograph ical boundaries of the state of Florida.   PROJECT INFORMATION:  Herbert Hoover Dike (HHD) is an earthen embankment system located along the perimeter of Lake Okeechobee, a large freshwater lake in South Florida. Components of the embankment system have been constructed intermittently since the ear ly 1900s.  Federal involvement began in the 1930s with the construction of dikes, for flood protection, along portions of the north and south shores. In the 1960s, the crest elevations of those dikes were increased and additional embankments were construct ed on the northwest and northeast shores. As a result, the HHD system now encircles Lake Okeechobee entirely, except in the vicinity of Fisheating Creek on the western shore.  The existing embankment is about 140 miles in length with crest elevations rangi ng from 32 to 46 feet, NGVD. Lakeside slopes are typically 6H:1V and landside slopes range from 2H:1V to 5H:1V, depending on foundation conditions and existing right-of-way. In addition to the earthen embankments, the HHD system also includes numerous wate r control structures (e.g., culverts, spillways, locks, and pump stations) along its length.  Based on observations during high lake levels and concerns regarding the performance of the embankment, the Corps of Engineers (COE), Jacksonville District, began  an evaluation of the HHD to assess the risk of failure and identify a solution to piping occurring through and under the dike. One of the recommended solutions is the installation of a cutoff wall through the crest of the embankment and into the dike foun dation.  The duties associated with this solicitation include providing Expert Technical Support during the design, solicitation and construction phases of the cutoff wall.  The contractor will interface with the Districts Project Engineer, Chief, Enginee ring Division and Chief, Construction Division. FACTORS FOR EVALUATION IN ORDER OF PRIORITY ARE:  1.  SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE:  The A/E must clearly demonstrate specialized experience and expertise in the design and construction of cutoff wall projects utilizing different constru ction techniques for the purpose of seepage control.

1.0	SCOPE

1.1  Background:

Presently, new electrical loads are being added to the existing building electrical distribution systems 
either by renovation projects or by tenant operational requirements. These types of load increases 
have had direct impact on the reliability and the efficiency of the entire building electrical system. 
Lack of proper updating of existing one-line diagrams and load coordination has created a direct 
negative impact on our operational and maintenance programs and has created nuisance tripping. 
The intend of this project is to update one-line diagram, perform comprehensive load coordination 
analysis and arc flash calculations for electrical distribution system of each building within the NIH 
campus in accordance with the current status. Contractor shall furnish all necessary supervision and 
qualified staff to fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Appendix A identifies the specific buildings covered under this contract and the approximate square footage per building.

Perform short circuit calculations and load coordination analysis for maximum protection and 
maintain optimum coordination between several protection devices starting from 15KV equipments 
and ending on 120/208V Main breaker at each building individually. Develop model and calculate 
fault current to determine clearing functions for short circuit, instantaneous, long time delay, short 
time delay over-current, and ground fault. The results form this device coordination study will be 
evaluated to determine possible deficiencies between protective devices. New recommended 
settings shall be entered and results evaluated for optimum coordination. The time-current 
characteristic curves shall be plotted to maintain time intervals between upstream and downstream 
protection devices.  Contractor shall develop a report including complete data, findings and recommendation supported

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).

Overview:  There are leadership courses within Air Education Training Command (AETC) that are paper based or classroom based training that have not converted to leading edge instructional technology.  Until recent times the fidelity and ease of use of computer based courseware applications have not been able to meet the high demand for interactive scenario based learning.  
Recent advances in courseware authoring applications include the use of simulations with humans being displayed as AVATARS (computer-generated images of humans).  These advances could lead to the conversion of current legacy leadership training courses to computer based training.  

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to provide a courseware development application capable of presenting human interfaces which will engage the student in making real time decisions based on realistic scenarios. 

2) The delivered courseware product must have a user interface that can be learned and manipulated by course managers and classroom instructors.

3) The delivered courseware will be capable of creating realistic AVATAR figures with speech and facial expressions that can be tailored to meet the needs of the leadership interfaces from various courses of instruction.

4) The vendor must be able to provide initial training of the delivered authoring language. 

5) The vendor must provide specific examples of how the effectiveness of the delivered courseware system can be evaluated in comparison to the current training system.

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to make the following changes to the Proposers Information Package (PIP):
 
The page count total for the ARGUS-IS BAA 07-23 technical proposal was increased by two pages, for the Evaluation Factors, as described in section H.2.8.  New page count totals can be found on page 36, section H.2. of the Proposer Information Package (PIP).  This change in page count does not change the due date for proposal submission.  The due date for proposal submission is 9 April 2007 (1300 EST) to be considered for the first round of funding.  While the proposals submitted after the initial 9 April 2007 deadline will be evaluated by a Government review panel, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  A typo was also corrected under H.2.1.

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be  issued on or about 01 May 2007, will include a draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor?s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government  anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluati clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation issue date TBD and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractors personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  
Current technical data for this requirement will be posted on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=FA2517-06-R-8002 and also available on FedBizOps as zip files.  Currently, this is the only technical data available for this effort and no Air Force Technical Orders or Instructions are available for this project.  There is a VENDOR USER GUIDE available on the FedTeDS website.  The government request interested parties to review the technical information on FedTeds and provide us with opinions whether there is adequate information available to develop and submit a proposal for this requirement. 
 It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central on of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                              
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

<DESC>FA8620-07-C-4020 Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) 1C/2C:  This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center , 659  Aeronautical Systems Squadron intends to award a contract on a sole source  basis to Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. for the rapid  development, integration and testing of a fieldable, scaled, communication  intelligence system based on the ASIP architecture for the MQ-1, MQ-1X,  MQ-9 and RQ-4B (Block 30 I) Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The sensor portion  of the system will collect and process selected signals that are  classified up to and including Top Secret/SCI.  Specific requirements are  listed in Section 3 of the ASIP 1C/2C Systems Requirement Document that is  classified Secret/SI (available for review at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio).  The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System will command and control  the ASIP 1C/2C sensors using interface standards established on the  baseline ASIP program. Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. is the sole designer,  developer, and manufacturer of the ASIP family of sensors and is the only  firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data  required to build these sensors in a timely and cost effective manner.  The anticipated design is a scaled version of the existing ASIP sensor and  requires minimal dollars and time to develop.  Planned spiral upgrade and  logistical support funding is insufficient to upgrade/maintain unique  solutions for these platforms and the existing ASIP systems so a single  architecture is required.  Developing a unique solution for these  platforms would result in duplication of efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however,  interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond  to the requirement to the POCs listed.  Information received will be used  to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The  determination to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Numbered note  22 applies. In accordance with recent Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, the position of the ASC Ombudsman has been  terminated.  If any potential source has questions, comments or concerns  about this particular acquisition please direct all routine non-technical  issues to Mr. Brad Penn, Phone (937) 904-7149, e-mail:  bradley.penn@wpafb.af.mil and for technical issues contact Mr. John Frey,  Phone (937) 255-5999, e-mail: john.frey@wpafb.af.mil For more information on "Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP)  1C/2C SIGINT Sensor Development", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5215

<CONTACT>Rhonda Fernandez Contract Specialist 7037871348     rhonda.fernandez@mms.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this Modification is to revised the date for submission of Quotes and respond to Questions submitted to the Contracting Officer. A. The new date for submission has been revised from May 4, 2007 to May 18, 2007. Questions:  RFQ M07PS13151 Minerals Management Service DOI 03/01/2007 The following response is being provided to questions asked regarding RFQ M07PS13151 for Management & Logistics of Oceanographic Equipment - "Launch 1273"Minerals Management Service DOI 03/06/2007 1.  In the qualifications section, you've asked for "relevant experience in the scientific disciplines."  For the vessel captain and crew, are there specific scientific duties they will be required to perform in addition to operating and maintaining the vessel?                        RESPONSE - There are no specific scientific duties to perform. However, the captain and crew are                        responsible to oversee a safe operational situation, so they will need to assess sea state and                                  weather/ice conditions in relation to scientific tasks to be achieved over short-term and long-term                             planning horizons. It is helpful if they understand logistical needs of scientists in order to maintain                             safe operations.       2.   Under Program and Data Management, you have also asked for "Evidence and sufficiency of a Project plan and system designed to ensure continuous evidence of data possession, comparison, and security."  Are the vessel operators required to have experience in the control, tracking and management of evidentiary data?                          RESPONSE  -  No; that wording in this RFQ pertains to notations such as  captain's log, expenses,                          maintenance records, etc. 3.  Will MMS or other contractor scientific personnel be on board the vessel to conduct the specific research required, or will the vessel crew be required to do this?                         RESPONSE  -  The vessel crew will not be responsible to perform the scientific research.  The                                Government realizes the boat service personnel are not the scientists; rather they prepare the boat,                        get it in the water, and provide a captain to pilot the ship during the scientific field season.  The                                 scientists come from our studies contracts and use the ship to collect data.  The Launch effort is not                       looking for scientists, but the vendor must be able to work with scientists and accommodate their                             needs. 4.   Proposers are asked to either replicate the established routine or propose a new approach.  Will MMS publish their "established routine with key vendors and personnel at Prudhoe Bay?"                          RESPONSE  -  The RFQ constitutes a public presentation of MMS' existing "established routine".                                However, each bidder is free to bid on the established routine, or suggest an alternate solution                                with estimated costs.  5.   Can we have access to previous years Field Season Operation Plans?                         RESPONSE  -   Last year's operation plans are described in the RFQ as the "established routine".                             Perhaps you mean to request a sample "cruise plan", which will change from year to year. A                                   sample is attached, but you should keep in mind that the field season objectives and duration and                             specific location changes every year. 6.   To determine the proper personnel mix and pricing, can you clarify the expected positions and labor hours by position?              a. RFQ discusses tasks performed April through September - are there tasks to be performed Oct through                May?                          RESPONSE  -  This contract calls for a field season around the open water period and a                                           "hibernation" period when the vessel is not in use for many months. The exact timing of this dual                              season plan may vary with each bidder, but MMS imagines that no tasks need be performed from                            October through May. In past years the vessel remains in heated storage at Prudhoe Bay and the                            only activity is payment of a monthly invoice for storage rental space. MMS intends to retain                                      management of monthly invoices for storage through the winter.              b.  RFQ discusses a PM and a vessel captain/crew.                     i For a 36' vessel we are assuming a licensed master with one deckhand is sufficient and both these                      personnel would be full time from April through September each year.  Is this a valid assumption?                        RESPONSE  -  Full time labor may not be necessary until the vessel is operational in the water,                      beginning in late July until the vessel is put again into winter storage. Are there requirements for                      these  positions at other times during the year? Only as described in 6 (a) above.                   ii The project managercan the vessel master act as the PM or is a separate position required?                       RESPONSE  -  A separate position is not required.   Are PM duties required year around? No.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. AMENDMENT 2 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-CSW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-CSW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the Search by Solicitation / Award Number block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane has developed a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification will be published on or about December 2006-January 2007.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification is Friday, 27 April 2007. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Sunday, 14 January 2007, in Orlando, Florida.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 5 January 2007.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 5 January 2007, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI) and possibly other direct Government cont

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: 	Program name 	Government or contractor POC 	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. 	Date & period of performance 	Cost of effort 	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, were looking for ways to implement a throttle  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007. Modifications: 1.

Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the AN/FPS-133, Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS).  The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 May 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group.  The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites and other objects penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite and space debris metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008). The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause)

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - Request for Information

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)/Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is exploring an initiative where DSCR intends to award a Performance-Based Logistics Contract to provide worldwide F-Series engine consumable and reparable parts support.  These items consist of sole source, limited source, and competitive NSNs.  The F-Series engine family includes the F101, F110, and F118 aircraft engines.

Though the direct focus of this PBL contract is to improve maintenance support of F-Series engines at OC-ALC, the ultimate goal of this contract is to increase the worldwide level of readiness of Air Force F-Series engines, to include those maintained at intermediate and operational Air Force maintenance units.  

Sources are sought for a potential 10-year contract (five-year base with one five-year option period) that will provide for a third party contractor to have control over the various logistical support elements?from the multiple suppliers and producers, the production lines, inventory levels, and transportation resources to support the customer.  The prospective provider will be responsible for forecasting, inventory sustainment, just in time inventory, kitting parts on contract, configuration management/reliability improvement, process improvements, obsolescence management, on-site maintenance support, and cost sharing through parts manufacturing approval process.  The contract would cover worldwide, integrated supply chain management support for approximately 9,460 (9,281 DLA managed, 179 Air Force Managed) consumable and reparable parts identified to the F-Series engines.  There is a possibility that additional NSNs could be covered after contract award.

Items to be included in this effort may not be limited to those identified in this notice.  The anticipated scope of services is:

1.  Inventory Sustainment: The contractor is to ensure required assets are available to the warfighter on a timely basis and without interruption.  

2.  Backorders: Will ensure there are no backorders older than 30 days. 

3.  NMCS hours: Reduce average NMCS hours by 10% per year.  

4.  Collaborative Joint Forecasting: The contractor is to provide forecasting for all NSNs on the PBL contract in support of F-Series engines.  

5.  Just in Time Inventory: The contractor is required to meet delivery time frames established on each delivery order (i.e. CDD). 

6.	Inventory Reduction for DLA and Air Force managed items: The contractor will reduce the wholesale depot level inventory by 10% annually to agreed upon levels over an agreed upon period of time.  

7.	 Kitting Parts on Contract at Delivery Point: The contractor is to provide parts needed as part of a kit at delivery point per customer requirements.  

8.	 Process Improvements: The contractor is to evaluate the supply chain processes of DLA and the Air Force and recommend improvements.  

9.  Obsolescence Management : The contractor is to notify the government of items that are becoming obsolete and recommend replacements as well as verify items that the government has deemed to be obsolete and recommend alternatives if available.  

10.  On-Site Maintenance Support: The contractor is to provide on-site support to facilitate process improvements, forecasting, configuration management/reliability improvement and resolve critical needs and requirements.  

11.  Configuration Management/Reliability Improvement: The contractor is to identify and recommend replacement items, new or reconfigured items that will improve reliability and overall life cycle performance or safety of engine(s).  

12.  Cost Sharing thru Parts Manufacturing Approval Process: As the Air Force identifies items where costs savings can be achieved by procuring parts from commercial vendors under the PMA program; the contractor is to utilize these vendors as sources to the greatest extent possible. 

SUMMARY

One of the elements to be gained from this sources sought is to gauge the industry for integrated supply chain management capability for consumable and reparable parts for F-Series engines and determine the socioeconomic status of the industry base for this type of initiative.  All respondents are requested to provide the following information:

1)  Indicate your business size status under the proposed NAICS code of 336412 (1,000 for manufacturers and 500 for non-manufacturers) and whether or not your company qualifies in any sub-category (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB).

2)  Is this a requirement your company could satisfy?  If so, how?

3)  Identify company capabilities.

4)  What capabilities does your company have to achieve desired outcomes as specified in the draft SOW?

Offers should not be included.  This initiative is still under consideration and currently in a market research phase.  Please send your notice of interest and above requested information to Dolores O?Brien, Acquisition Specialist, e-mail Dolores.obrien@dla.mil no later than 31 May 2007.  Note:  DLA is willing to entertain alternatives for supporting these engine lines.  Provide detailed explanation of your proposed alternative to Dolores O?Brien no later than 31 May 2007.

<DESC>The centennial of the US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Forestry Program will be in 2010.  As part of the observance of this milestone in Indian Forest Management, the BIA is seeking sources that are capable of producing an administrative history of the program covering the period of 1986 to 2010.  In 1986 a history of the Forestry program was published.  A Forest in Trust:  Three Quarters of a Century of Indian Forestry, 1910-1986, was researched and written by the Historical Research Associates of Missoula, MT.  Our objective for this project is to develop a companion history document The project is to research and write an administrative history of the Indian Forestry Program covering the period of 1986 to 2010.  The history will include changes in law, policy, and other significant developments affecting the program.  Some of the changes during this period are:  enactment of the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act of 1990; enactment of the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994; a major revision of the General Forestry Regulations (25 CFR Part 163) in 1995; two independent assessments of the Indian Forestry Program; tribes assuming forest management responsibilities; intertribal organizations emerging as advocates for Indian natural resource interests; changing forest management practices; and the changing role of the BIA in the management of Indian forest resources.  In addition to tracking significant policy changes and events over the 25 year period, the project will include in-depth research on the forest management programs for a number of specific reservations and conducting oral history interviews with BIA, tribal, and other officials associated with Indian Forestry.  The list of reservations for in-depth study and the list of potential interviewees will be determined in consultation with the BIA Division of Forestry and Wildland Fire Management. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Bored stiff?

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE), is conducting a market survey to determine industry capabilities in providing a Ground Radio Maintenance Automatic Test System (GRMATS).  The GRMATS is a digital, software-defined automatic radio test system. MARCORSYSCOM is also interested in reviewing possible design options, performance information, and material solutions for these systems.  Current and future tactical radio procurements by Program Manager for Communications and Networking Systems (PM CNS) will be software defined ground radio communications sets that are difficult to support with the current suite of ground radio test/maintenance equipment.  Software defined radios will require software defined test measurement and diagnostic equipment to allow maintenance shops to support this equipment.  The GRMATS will be used for test and diagnostic functions for both current and future (e.g., JTRS) software-defined, tactical radios. A user-developed test program capability with a standard style guide is desired.  It is anticipated that the GRMATS requirement will include a current system solution, development of a components list, calibration, maintenance, Test Program Sets (TPSs), and New Equipment Training (NET). It is anticipated that the list of items below will potentially require TPSs associated with the GRMATS solution: 	AN/PRC-150, Radio Set, HF, Manpack 	AN/PRC-117, Radio Set, Multi-band, Falcon II 	AN/PRC-148, Radio Set, Multi-band 	VRC-103, 104 and 111, Radio Sets 	AN/PRC-153, Radio Set, Integrated, Intra-squad (IISR -Motorola XTS 2500) 	GRC-171, Radio Set 	Tactical Remote Sensors System (TRSS) 	Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) For information about Automated Test Equipment see the MARCORSYSCOM website at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmtmde/  Interested firms should submit capabilities and experience descriptions, design approaches, design concepts and any other relevant information to MARCORSYSCOM.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on line (NECO) site at www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-SCW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-SCW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the Search by Solicitation / Award Number block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane intends to develop a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Performance Specification will be published on or about September-October 2006.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification is Friday, 1 December 2006. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Thursday, 19 October 2006, in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 15 September 2006.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 15 September 2006, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov.

<CONTACT>Jason Gruber, 586.753.2213
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a r equest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informat ion requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.   POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: Background:  TARDEC is currently evaluating the economic and technical feasibility of creating a single oil formulation that is both versatile (used as engine oil, transmission fluid, and hydraulic fluid) and meets extreme operating conditions for use in c ombat/tactical ground equipment in all climate conditions.  The results of this market survey will be used to identify existing commercial base stocks or base stock blends that can be used in both extremely low ambient temperature and extremely high ambien t temperature environments (i.e., arctic through desert).  In addition, this market survey will be used to identify potential suppliers of base stocks or base stock blends for the possible development of new fully formulated oil.  TARDEC is seeking to dete rmine if existing commercial base stocks or base stock blends possess both extreme low ambient temperature and high ambient temperature performance in terms of operational viscosity requirements, volatility, and compatibility with typical elastomeric mater ials.  Potential commercial base stocks or base stock blends may be subjected to further laboratory tests to characterize low temperature and high temperature viscometric properties.  If laboratory tests prove successful, then the base oils might continue to be evaluated in future research and development programs.  Ultimately, the base stocks or base stock blends may be combined with a suitable additive package(s) to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a single fully formulated lubricant that can be used in military diesel engines, powershift transmissions, and some hydraulic systems under full range of extreme ambient temperature conditions (arctic through desert environments).   Responding to this survey does not guarantee further evaluations or considerations. Responding to this survey does not guarantee any government business or contract. Electronic responses to this survey are preferred.  Provide responses to allen.s.comfort@us.army.mil or maria.goetz@us.army.mil. RATIONALE:  The results of this Market Survey will be used to identify potential candidate base oils for further laboratory evaluation.  Responding to this survey does not guarantee further evaluation or consideration.  Responding to this survey does not guarantee any  government business or contract. RESPONSES DUE: Responses to this Market Survey are requested no later than 01 June 2007. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC.   Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a r equest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informat ion requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.   POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: Background:  The purpose of this market survey is to identify potential suppliers of arctic engine oil under Military Specification MIL-PRF-46167D, which covers one grade of internal combustion compression-ignition engine lubricating oil with Military Symb ol OEA-30 and NATO Code O-183.  This specification requires an oil formulation that is both versatile (used as engine oil, transmission fluid, and hydraulic fluid) and meets extreme operating conditions for use in combat/tactical ground equipment.  The lub ricating oil covered by this specification is intended for the crankcase lubrication of reciprocating compression-ignition engines used in all types of military combat/tactical ground equipment. The oils are also intended for the same application in power transmissions, hydraulic systems, and non-hypoid gear units of engineer/construction equipment, materials handling equipment and combat/tactical ground equipment. The specification product is intended for crankcase lubrication under all conditions of servi ce, as defined by appropriate lubrication orders, when ambient temperatures are in the range of less than -46 degrees Celsius to +32 degrees Celsius.   There is an immediate need to procure arctic engine oil for military supply system; however, the most recent solicitation resulted in insufficient number of qualified bids.  This market survey attempts to identify alternate suppliers who would be willing t o bid on current solicitations and/or purchase requests for arctic engine oil in military supply system with the stipulation that the products first become qualified under MIL-PRF-46167D, Lubricating Oil, Internal Combustion Engine, Arctic,.  Copies of p erformance requirements may be found in MIL-PRF-46167D, which may be obtained on-line via the Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/online/start/.  Responding to this survey does not guarante e any government business or contract. Electronic responses to this survey are preferred.  Provide responses to allen.s.comfort@us.army.mil or maria.goetz@us.army.mil. RATIONALE:  The results of this Market Survey will be used to identify alternate sources of supply for potential future solicitations and procurement of arctic engine oil.  Responding to this survey does not guarantee any government business or contract. RESPONSES DUE: Responses to this Market Survey are requested no later than 01 June 2007. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC.   Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following format: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

IMMSS is comprised of numerous modular furniture product lines which are reconfigurable and interchangeable, not only within each product line but also with all other product lines included in the IMMSS program.  'IMMSS' was initially developed and provided to the Government by Herman Miller fo r Healthcare under an expired negotiated Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with MEDCOM Contracting in 1996 and further provided to the Government under a follow-on sole source ID/IQ contract in 2005.  The Government is currently perf orming market research to determine if there are other vendors who are capable of performing the IMMSS requirements.  The results of the market research will aid the Government in developing its acquisition strategy for this procurement.  An ID/IQ contract (s) with one base year ordering period and four one year options is anticipated under which firm fixed price task orders may be awarded for design, systems furniture, delivery/transportation, installation, maintenance,  reconfiguration services, restorativ e services, panel fabric replacement services, clinical analysis services, extended project management services, inventory services, warehousing services, product orientation training, etc.  It is also the Government's objective to provide maximum practica ble opportunities under this anticipated acquisition to qualified small business concerns, if available.

<CONTACT>BETH-ANN MENDELL, 609-562-4869
<DESC>History and Background The Chief Army Reserve (CAR) has appointed a committee to gather information and benchmark on employer outreach, health and medical insurance and benefits. There is currently a great deal of Soldier-related legislation that is either proposed or pending approval by both the House and the Senate.  This legislation may impact the future of how we treat Soldiers (and their families) with regard to health plans, medical coverage and benefits.  See enclosure one for more information entitled FY07 Introduced Bills with DoD Input. The government is looking for input from the civilian community in order to find out where the Army Reserve is in comparison to other ma jor employers in the US.  This is his benchmarking goal.   American businesses employ Army Reserve Soldiers.  Because of this duality of employment, the Soldier is a shared asset.  The Soldier is an asset to American businesses and also an asset to the Army Reserve.  Health, medical insurance and benefits are item s that some of our Army Reserve Soldiers have in their civilian jobs.  However, some Soldiers have no medical insurance or benefits in their civilian employment.   There is currently a significant amount of proposed and pending legislation that calls for health/medical insurance and benefits to be given to Army Reserve Soldiers.  In order to prepare for such a potential benefit (of this cost and magnitude) the CAR ne eds information from the civilian community on what is out there for his Soldiers who have civilian employment that has, as a condition of employment, health/medical coverage and benefits.  Soldiers who have no insurance or benefits in their civilian job s are at risk for not being able to take care of their own health.   An estimated 20% - 40% of Soldiers could be in the category (of having no health/medical insurance or benefits as part of their civilian jobs).   Success is essential to employers and the USAR, the Army Reserve and the health / medical insurance and benefit industries need to identify information that will enable us to benefit our Soldiers.  The Army Reserve Soldier may not have health/medical insur ance as part of his or her civilian employment.  Unless such a Soldier is on Annual Training orders or mobilized, that individual must pay for the cost of his or her own health/medical needs without the benefit of help from the Army.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Holder Construction is the only firm that can accomplish the work with favorable results since they are currently working in the building, in same proximity, and have already mobilized on-site and have obtained all required security clearances for their employees.  Holder Construction is already under contract with the GSA as the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) for the RBR Modernization Project.  Also, Holder construction has on-site resources and has obtained preliminary pricing from sub-contractors for this specific work for this project.  They also have an office immediately adjacent to the new fitness center space, and they are working to remodel the restrooms that are adjacent to the new fitness center.  Holder has the necessary dumpsters, equipment storage and tools on site for this work.  Also, the work includes installing new restrooms and ceilings and lights that are exactly like the other work in the building which has been performed successfully throughout the facility.  They have the necessary personnel on-hand to perform the work, and their sub-contractors are familiar with the requirements for working in the RBR.

The expedited performance through their unique project knowledge, experience, and extensive documentation of current conditions, would result in less risk and impact to the government.   The requirement to procure these additional services under full and open competition would result in increased time, costs and risks to the Government because of the problems involved with additional coordination, mobilization, and multiple contractors working within the same space.  Therefore, these services will be procured using other than full-and-open-competition-based on the grounds that Holder Construction is the logical firm that can provide these construction services.  The total estimated range of this action is approximately $240,000 - $290,000.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government intent or obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Denise Butler, Contracting Officer, phone 404-331-4627, facsimile 404-331-7696, at denise.butler@gsa.gov or, GSA, Acquisition Management Division (4PGA), 401 W. Peachtree St., NW, Atlanta, GA  30308.  Written comments should be received by the Contracting Officer within 15 days of publication of this notice.

We require one lot (1) of Knoll modular furniture.  


Description:


Knoll cubicle modular furniture to support the increase of personnel.  Furniture must interlock with Knoll cubicle modular furniture already in place.  Beaux-Arts Group, Inc is the sole Knoll furniture distributor for Tampa, Florida.  The delivery order shall be awarded under Knoll GSA Schedule GS-28F-8029A.  


Delivery shall be FOB Destination to MacDill AFB, FL 33621. NAICS Code is 442110, Furniture Stores, the size standard of which is $6,500,000.00 (Not to exceed). The clauses incorporated are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

Marine Corps Forces Central Command (MARCENT) has installed Knoll modular furniture in all MARCENT facilities.  The Knoll modular furniture design for stability and system integrity hinges on the attachment of properly fitted cubicle systems.  In addition, the MARCENT Knoll cubicle system was designed and set-up to maximize the available space within MARCENT.  To conjoin another cubicle system would seriously degrade the entire system and would not allow for the maximum use of available space.  The other option would be to purchase an entire cubicle system which is currently valued at $439K.  Pursuing another cubicle system would not be cost effective nor would it be reasonable when additional Knoll cubicle systems can be purchased for $32K.

<SUBJECT>B -- Special Studies and Analysis - Not R&D
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA), for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate and award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to the American Dental Education Association (ADEA), 1400 K Street N.W., Washington, DC 20005, to provide survey data and analysis of data obtained from survey information collected by the ADEA from calendar year 2000 through year 2010. 
Based upon the results of market survey conducted by the Government that the American Dental Education Association is the only know source with the requisite data already collected that will satisfy the agencies requirements.   
The sole source determination is based upon survey information data collected by the ADEA since the year 2000 and on the original design and development of the survey data and databases.  The ADEA owns and has proprietary rights to the survey data and has the technical expertise to analyze the data.   
Purchasing the survey data and the analysis services from ADEA will enable NIDCR to better assess and refine its extramural training program and will save the Government sufficient time and financial resources which is not expected to be recovered through competition or from the Government conducting a separate evaluation study. 
Therefore, an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and size Standard is $6.5 million.
This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  

Statement of Work.   Background: The objective of this project is to perform specific data matching tasks to support the NIDCR ongoing evaluation of its extramural training programs.  The mission of NIDCR is to improve oral, dental and craniofacial health of all Americans through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information.  The key components of the NIDCR organizational structure, including those with major involvement in this task order are as follow:  The Office of Science Policy and Analysis, located in the Office of the Director, develops and coordinates science policy and program planning and evaluation for the Institute.  The Office?s activities include: (1) research agenda development, science priority setting, strategic planning, science policy briefings, and special planning efforts on specific research issues or initiatives; (2) liaison with government, academic and private sector planning, evaluation, science policy, legislative, and survey agencies and organizations; (3) development, maintenance and updating of the Institute?s scientific coding system; (4) design and prepare reports on NIDCR scientific programmatic and funding activities; and (5) development, conduct and coordination of program evaluation and assessment activities, including assessment of the content, significance, and effectiveness of NIDCR research, research training and science transfer/health promotion programs.  NIDCR?s Extramural training programs are also located in the Office of the Director.  NIDCR has adopted a multifaceted and comprehensive approach to training and career development.  NIDCR awards grants to institutions to support promising students who seek training in the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences that form the foundation of modern oral health research.  NIDCR also supports fellowship and career award grants to individuals, to encourage and enable students and young scientists to pursue careers in oral health research.  NIDCR?s portfolio of training programs encompasses both pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training, and includes both dentists and non-dentists.  In addition to providing direct training funding, NIDCR supports the next generation of researchers by participating in NIH extramural loan repayment programs.  Extramural research at NIDCR is organized into two centers that are responsible for planning, developing, reviewing, funding, and managing research, research training and career development supported by grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. These are the Center for Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases, the Center for Clinical Research.  Evaluation of Extramural Training Activities:  NIDCR conducts ongoing, prospective evaluation of extramural training activities.  These efforts include data collection from NIH and NIDCR data sources on individuals supported by extramural training programs, their subsequent NIH grant applications, current and subsequent publications, and other activities.  The purpose of these evaluation efforts is to identify the outcomes of NIDCR training efforts across programs, funding mechanisms, and institutions.  Objective:  The objective of this contract is to perform specific data matching tasks to support NIDCR?s ongoing data collection and evaluation efforts related to extramural training.  Using data provided by NIDCR, staff from the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) will match NIDCR trainees name, birth date, and/or gender to ADEA?s survey of dental faculty.  Such data will allow NIDCR to have more robust information about the career path of former trainees, and assist in analyses that examine the effectiveness of NIDCR?s training programs and mechanisms.  Scope and specific tasks:  Within the first 6 months of the contract, the Contractor shall:  A) Meet with the NIDCR team to finalize specific time frames and requirements for analysis-related tasks.  B)  Upon provision of a spreadsheet from NIDCR in a mutually-agreed upon format, within a period of 4 weeks, provide a series of spreadsheets or database to NIDCR that contain the original data augmented with specific data from ADEA?s survey of dental faculty.  C)  Generate these data by matching records from NIDCR and ADEA data on the following fields (in order of precedence):  last name, first name, middle name or initial, birth date or year, and gender.  (If practical, other fields may be used as identifiers in later years.)  D)  Include in these spreadsheets data from the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.  E)  Divide each spreadsheet or database table into three categories ? records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on all identifying fields, records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on last name, first name, and at least one other field; and records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on first and last name only. F) Include in the augmented spreadsheets the following variables: i) Appointment in a dental school faculty position; ii) Whether the appointment is full time, part time, or volunteer basis; iii) Category of appointment, as provided on ADEA?s faculty survey; iv) Other variables as mutually agreed upon between NIDCR and ADEA.  G)  ADEA will not provide contact information or other sensitive information to NIDCR.  During each subsequent year of the contract, the Contractor shall:  H)  Upon provision of a spreadsheet from NIDCR in a mutually-agreed upon format, within a period of 4 weeks, provide a series of spreadsheets or database to NIDCR that contain the original data augmented with specific data from ADEA?s survey of dental faculty.  I)  Generate these data by matching records from NIDCR and ADEA data on the following fields (in order of precedence):  last name, first name, middle name or initial, birth date or year, and gender.  (If practical, other fields may be used as identifiers in later years.)  J)  Include in these spreadsheets data from the most recent year of the ADEA survey.  K)  Divide each spreadsheet or database table into three categories ? records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on all identifying fields, records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on last name, first name, and at least one other field; and records where ADEA and NIDCR?s data match on first and last name only.  L)  Include in the augmented spreadsheets the following variables:  i) Appointment in a dental school faculty position; ii)  Whether the appointment is full time, part time, or volunteer basis; iii)  Category of appointment, as provided on ADEA?s faculty survey; iv) Other variables as mutually agreed upon between NIDCR and ADEA.  M) ADEA will not provide contact information or other sensitive information to NIDCR.  
Place of Performance:  Within ADEA and/or NIDCR offices as appropriate.  
Government Furnished Equipment and Facility:  Meeting rooms will be provided for the contractor to confer/coordinate with NIDCR staff and contractor personnel if needed. 
Period of Performance:  The survey and data analysis shall all be completed between May 2007 to March 2010.  The deliverables are the data collected from the annual surveys from 2000 to 2009.  
Security Considerations:  The contractor agrees to abide by all pertinent security recommendations and privacy requirements of NIDCR and NIH.
Technical Selection Criteria:   1) Survey data elements development & design of one or more individuals who can demonstrate sufficient database skills to perform data match.   2) Survey database development and design which includes experience with Microsoft Access and/or SQL Server databases and experience with data typing and matching issues.  3) Minimum of ten (10) years of data collection and access.  4) Successful past performance in survey development, design, and data collection.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of intent to award a sole source
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Lozinak Baseball Properties LLC.  The award will be made for the purchase of an advertising package with the Jackson Jaxx Baseball team in Jackson, TN This procurement is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, for Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Randal Halbrooks, PO Box 41502 Nashville, or sent by email to randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil . Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Res ponses to this notice shall be received no later than 11:00 AM Central Daylight Savings Time, Friday, May 11, 2007. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is Randal Halbrooks, Contract Specialist, at randal.halbrooks@ng.army.mil. The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase.  1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an advertising package for the Jackson Jaxx 2007 Baseball Season purchased through Lozinak Baseball Properties Inc., requested by the Recruiting Division of the Tennessee Arm y National Guard. 2.	Jackson, Tennessee the seventh (7TH) largest city in the state of Tennessee with a population of fifty nine thousand, six hundred and forty three (59,643); the marketing division for the Recruiting Division of the Tennessee Army National Guard needs an advertising media to target potential recruits in this population center. 3.	The total estimated value of this advertising package is on file at this contracting office and can be obtained through Freedom of Information Act procedures. 4.	Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5.	The Jackson Diamond Jaxx AA Baseball Team Proposal is the only available advertisement to the demographic group needed for recruiting to the Tennessee Army National Guard in the Jackson Tennessee area, therefore making them the only source capable of fu lfilling this requirement. 6.	Efforts to solicit other contractors will be made via http://www.fedbizopps.gov in accordance with FAR 5.2.  A Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source will be issued on Wednesday May 9, 2007. 7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices previously proposed by the offeror. 8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 711211 for sports teams and clubs in Tennessee. Lozinak Baseball Properties LLC was th e only CCR registered vendor with the NAICS code for sports teams and clubs in this area. 9.	There are no other facts to support the use of other than full and open competition. 10.	No other firms expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Jackson Jaxx baseball team is the sole baseball team in the Jackson, Tennessee area of its kind. 12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<SUBJECT>--Modification to Extend Ordering Period and Increase Contract Capacity for Current Facility Repair/Renewal contracts DACA87-02-D-0035, DACA87-03-D-0004, DACA87-03-D-0005, DACA87-03-D-0006, and DACA87-03-D-0007
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts which will increase each contracts c apacity and extend each contracts ordering period consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The FRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against five ( 5) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installation s and facilities.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures.  One (1) of the five (5) contracts was awarded in fiscal year 2002 and the remaining four (4) contracts were awarded in fiscal year 2003.  The ordering per iod for these contracts will expire in the next 6-9 months.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on FRR acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on ac quisitions are anticipated to be released by Summer 2007 and the awards made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract cover age.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current FRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months with an additional six (6) month option period.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the c urrent contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional six (6) month option should the follow-on acquisitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additional six (6) month option would be exercised. The programmatic capacity established at time of award of the current contracts was established at $355 million over a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established pri or to the award of the contracts based on an analysis of  the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work, and upon historical FRR contract/program data.  Due to u nforeseen hurricane response requirements, the FRR capacity was prematurely expended.  As a result, it is necessary that the contracts be modified to allow for additional capacity to cover the extended ordering period.  Based upon future anticipated requir ements and taking into consideration the predicted upcoming severe hurricane season, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contracts to increase the capacity of each contract by $20 million.  The Government reserves the right to unilateral ly modify the capacity of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities.  Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts  despite any remaining capacity. The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-02-D-0035 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0004 (RCI, Inc., 8(a) Small Business), DACA87-03-D-0005 (Global Engineering & Construction LLC, Small Business), DACA87-03-D-0006 (Vanguard Contractors LLC), and DACA87-03-D-0007 (Ameresco Solutions, Inc.).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.   The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority pro vided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due  to the unique prior FRR experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed a ctions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capab ility Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include pricing information which includes profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; and any other information indicating a legitimat e ability to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Naval Special Warfare Development Group, Virginia Beach, Virginia has a potential requirement to procure the following:  Clin 0001,  3 each, Only Male German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois and Dutch Shepherds less than 70 lbs.  Dogs must be titled in KNPV, IPO, or Schutzhund.  The age of potential dogs must be between 18 and 36 months.  Pre trained dogs in explosives detection and patrol may be accepted.  Vendors must allow buyer to perform an extensive testing process prior to purchase, to include muzzle work, bite suit, dark area?s, steps, slick floors, gunfire, vehicles, etc.  The required performance and conditions under which a potential dual-purpose dog must perform are detailed below.  Attitude and behavior of all dogs:  All dogs must be generally alert, active, outgoing, curious, and confident.  They must display basic socialization and tolerance to people.  Some of the more common factors that disqualify a dog from the program are:  Over-aggressive dogs that are unable to work around people or other dogs.  Dogs that cannot be muzzled.  Dogs that is difficult to crate or uncrate.  Dogs that exhibit excessive panting that are not due to heat or exercise.  Dogs that is afraid, nervous or shy around people.  Dogs that exhibit sensitivity or fear to surroundings such as inside of building with different types of floor surfaces, stairs, or confining areas.  Dogs with low drive or dogs that do not have the desire to complete the task.  Dogs introduced to or trained to detect drugs and later trained to detect explosives or vice versa will not be considered for procurement.  Dogs that do not perform to the standards during the evaluation will not be considered for purchase.  
Medical Requirements ? In general, all dogs must be in excellent health with no acute or chronic disease or condition, which could either hamper their ability to perform, or would be excessively costly to treat.  At the time of evaluation, each animal must be medically able to ender training.  Gait.  All dogs must display normal mobility at a walk or run.  Dogs are disqualified for any gait abnormality, which could affect the dog?s ability to perform normal MWD duties.  Skin and Coat.  Skin and coat must be healthy in appearance, displaying no evidence of chronic dermatitis, allergies, infections, injuries or marked external parasite infestation (e.g., mange, flees, etc).  Teeth and Jaws.  Dogs will have normal dental occlusion, not overshot or undershot jaws.  All four canine teeth must be present and must not be weakened by notching, enamel hyperplasia or abnormal, excessive wear.  Heart and Lungs.  Heart sounds, rate and rhythm must be normal (e.g. no murmurs, arrhythmia, etc).  In general, the cardiovascular and respiratory system must be normal at rest and upon exercise.  Hip dysphasia and elbow dysphasia.  A malformation of  the hip and elbow joints, respectively, which usually results in degenerative joint disease, arthritis and chronic lameness.  Radiological evidence of hip dysphasia or elbow dysphasia, will disqualify a dog.  Nervous System and Basic Senses.  Any defect in the nervous system, to include the basic senses of vision, hearing and sense of smell, is disqualifying.  Examples include, but are not limited to, opacities of the cornea, eyelid deformities, cataracts, retinal degeneration, chronic otitis, acute or chronic rhinitis/sinusitis and spinal disease.  Heartworms.  All dogs submitted for purchase must be free of heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis).  Intestinal Parasitism.  Infection with intestinal parasites (roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, etc) may not be disqualifying, depending on the level of infection and the overall condition of the animal.  Presence of intestinal parasites is, however, an indication of poor care and will raise concern about the dog?s general health.  External Parasitism.  Presence of fleas, ticks, lice or mange mites may not be disqualifying, depending on the amount of  infestation, the degree of associated skin disease, and the overall condition of the dog.  Presence of external parasites is, however, an indication of poor care and will raise concern about the dog?s general health.  Immunization.  All dogs presented must have been vaccinated within the previous 12 months from rabies, canine distemper, canine adenovirus (Type 2), corona virus, Para influenza, parvovirus and leptospirosis.  A vaccination certificate with individual dog identification (name, tattoo, and brand or microchip #) must be provided on all dogs.  This facilitates health certificate preparation, if the dog is to be returned to the vendor.  Reproductive and Urinary System.  Any congenital or conformational abnormality is disqualifying, if the defect requires long-term medical treatment or results in a shortened working life of the dog.  (E.g. Cryptorchidism is not disqualifying unless the retained testicle results in medical complications not treatable by simple orchidectomy.) Detection.  Dogs will be tested with the following any type of ball, pipe, and PVC.  Dogs must have extreme retrieve and hunt drive for thrown toys.  Dogs must have extreme possessiveness of such toys.

units.  Warranty period to commence after the MCM 4M data units are activated on the 
GlobalStar network (brand name or equal to). Units shall include free firmware or software 
upgrades.  GlobalStar MCM 4M data units (brand name or equal to) will be peers to a software 
bonding server within the provider shore based network.  The GlobalStar MCM 4M data units 
(brand name or equal to) send de-multiplexed signaling through the RF spectrum.  A bonding 
server located within the provider earth station teleport then multiplexes the signaling converting 
to IP which is then sent on to either the Internet or a customer provided T-1.

QTY: 10 data units

CLIN 00002 ? 48K airtime minutes per modem between 8 MCM 4M data units, which consist of 4, 
9.6 Kbps modem cards, for a total of 32 modems.  MCM 4M units must be able to be brought on 
the GlobalStar network (brand name or equal to) using this airtime upon receipt of the MCM 4Ms.  
Airtime is exhausted when the modems use up the time.  Monthly billing statements to the MCM 
4M original purchaser is required.  Airtime usage should be able to be provided with a phone call 
to Technical Support. Airtime minutes will not expire according to a calendar date, but will expire 
when used on the GlobalStar network (brand name or equal to).  Also included will be any 
applicable one-time USF fees.

QTY: 32 modems
Period of Performance: 12 months

CLIN 00003 ? 16.8K airtime minutes per modem between 2 TISCOM (USCG?s

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10520, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the analysis of gene polymorphisms. A. Background Information. A population-based case-control study of air pollutants and asthma in Wayne County, Michigan completed the field collection of data and samples in January 2007.  Two hundred (200) blood samples were collected and white blood cells (WBC) isolated from 100 asthmatic and 100 non-asthmatic children aged 9-12 as part of the Mechanistic Indicators of Childhood Asthma Study (MICA).  These individuals answered questions related to medical history, smoking in the home, diet, and residential mobility. In addition, a number of effect modifiers, such as IgE allergen sensitivity, will be measured in the biological fluids. The rationale for selection of the 11 specific genes (see  table at EPA website http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd) and relevant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) is provided in the way of relevant studies in which associations between asthma and specific genotypes were evaluated. The interpretation of several of the studies referenced is limited by incomplete knowledge regarding the biological function of the various alleles.  Specific genotypes may influence disease risk by modifying the effects of environmental exposures.  The SNPs were selected by querying public databases for polymorphisms showing variation in African American (AA) samples, since that race represents approximately 85% of the individuals selected in the study. For genes with no AA variable SNPs in the databases, we selected based on studies reported in the literature.  To rank the available SNPs within each  gene, we used a simple "weight of evidence" summation that weights the information sources according to the following inequality:  African American sample > African sample > mixed-race sample including some African Americans.  In the table, the SNPs are organized by gene.  The polymorphisms listed are base substitutions, except for two common asthma-associated deletions (in GSTM1 and GSTT1).  For GSTT1, only four polymorphisms showing sufficient variation were shown in AA populations.  There are at least 5 polymorphisms for all other genes, as shown in the table.  Genotyping for all of the specific SNPs in the table is required.  B. Purpose and Objectives.  The objective of this contract is to extract DNA from blood collected from 200 participants and determine the presence of SNPs at five specified locations in  each of 11 genes (see table).  The prevalence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs needs to be assessed.  Other data analyses commonly used for quality control to identify systematic genotyping errors or find evidence of population stratification in unrelated individuals are required.  C. Contractor Requirements.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks: TASK 1:  The contractor shall extract DNA from 200 samples (White blood cell pellets to be provided). The contractor shall quantify genomic DNA concentration in units of nanograms per microliter.  The concentrations of the DNA samples shall be such that when the samples are loaded, 1-10 ng of DNA is used per reaction.  The contractor shall provide a report with the quantity of DNA and the DNA concentration for each sample to complete this Task. TASK 2:   The contractor shall conduct genotyping PCR analyses for the 11 genes listed and up to 5 SNPs per gene, except for GST T1 (which has 4 SNPs), specified in the table.  Genotyping shall be performed in duplicate for 10 percent of the DNA samples.  The use of duplicate sample analysis allows the investigator to ensure that identical genotypes are being generated by the analysis of ?identical? samples.  Should significant differences exist between values obtained for duplicates, further investigation shall be performed to evaluate the source of these unexpected variations.  The use of previously genotyped materials may also be used to ensure that the experimental genotyping assay is accurate and reproducible. TASK 3:  The contractor shall test for departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using the standard ?2 goodness-of-fit  test.  Testing for departure from HWE in control (non-asthmatic) samples is a preliminary test of association that is used to inform subsequent analyses.  Departure from HWE is used for quality control to identify systematic genotyping errors.  Departure from expected HWE also provides evidence of population stratification in unrelated individuals, indicating that analysis will have to account for uncertainty in the self-reported race of sample individuals.  The prevalence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across SNPs shall also be assessed.  This is a standard preliminary step in genetic association analysis that assures assumptions of independence are not violated.  If present, LD affects all subsequent analyses.  In the event of missing or incomplete data, LD can be used to analytically overcome these issues.   Tabular summaries of pair-wise (SNP-SNP) LD should display both the r2 and D' measures.  A Haploview-formatted input file, freely available from http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/, shall also be provided by the contractor to allow the visualization of LD patterns in the data.  The contractor shall provide to the EPA project officer the results of the analyses in a written report (see Deliverables Section, below).  The contractor shall provide the results of all applicable information from the analysis of calibration standards and standard reference materials.  The contractor shall properly store and return any unused DNA or DNA in solution at the completion of all analyses and the acceptance of the final report.   The contractor shall be responsible for the disposal of all expendable  materials (pipette tips, reaction wells, centrifuge tubes, etc.) used in the analysis work. D. Government Responsibilities.  The government researchers will be responsible for providing the 200 samples, consisting of White Blood Cell (WBC) pellets isolated from blood samples provided by the MICA Study participants.  Since the samples will only be identified by a code number, the EPA Project Officer will provide a list of samples according to the sample identifiers to allow the contractors to verify the number of samples.  E. Deliverables. Task 1:  The contractor shall provide a report with the quantity of DNA and the DNA concentration for each sample.  The contractor shall quantify genomic DNA concentration in units of nanograms per microliter.  The concentrations of the DNA samples shall be such that when the samples are  loaded, 1-10 ng of DNA is used per reaction. Task 2: The contractor shall provide a report with the preliminary SNPs determinations and a description of the duplicate analyses and other quality control measures that were taken to ensure the reproducibility of the assay.  Task 3: The contractor shall provide to the EPA Task Officer the results of the sample analyses in spreadsheet form (Microsoft Excel 2003 or later) and in a final report when all genotyping and subsequent data analyses are complete.  The spreadsheet shall contain at least one worksheet that presents the final, quality-assured data in tabular format having individual samples in rows and genotypes at each SNP in columns.  The report shall include all relevant calibration and quality control results (specified in Section C, above).  The contractor shall also provide  spreadsheets of the preliminary SNP-SNP linkage disequilibrium assessment (discussed in Section C, above).  Upon acceptance of this report by the EPA Project Officer, the contractor shall return any unused DNA or DNA in solution from the samples provided by the EPA researchers.  The table referenced above is available at the EPA Procurement website as part of the Statement of Work.  The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE will be 12 months from date of award. The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: A.  Technical Criteria: 1.

The calculation could result in increases or decreases in the price adjustment for fuel.  OPM will compensate the contractor for any calculated increases in fuel costs and the contractor would either, at OPMs discretion, pay OPM or issue a credit to OPM for any decreases in fuel costs. The Contracting Officer will make the final determination of which method of consideration the contractor will provide OPM for decreased fuel adjustments.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 (Two) TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR PHOTOGRAMMETRIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is a response to questions submitted in regards to system 3. Questions (Q) and Answers (A)are supplied as follows: Q:  The Dalsa camera (DS-21-04M15) that has 2048 by 2048 pixels      and runs at 15 frames per second has a single base camera      link output. I can attach two of these cameras to a single      IO Industries DVR Express DBCL board. You have specified two      of these (or equivalent boards)in the RFQ. Is the second a      spare or should we quote only 1 of these boards. A:  The second is a spare. Please Quote on each. Q:  If System 3 is to replicate exactly what is already in place     at Ames than I would not bid an option to system 3, since      the existing system uses the DS-21-04M15 cameras. Other wise      I can bid a lower cost option as follows:     Dalsa has two cameras that can meet the requirements of      system 3. The DS-21-04M15 or the PT-41-04M60. The PT-41 can      be set up to (via software) to run as a Medium CameraLink      camera at 60 frames per second or as a Base CameraLink      Camera at 30 frames per second. Can we include an option to      system 3 that uses the PT-41-04M60 in base mode ? This would      make all three systems have the same camera and would also      save a little bit of money. A:  We would like to have two additional 4M15 cameras to maintain     consistency. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and FedBizOpps on April 29, 2007.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQS FOR XRAY AND LASER SHEAROGRAPHY VACUUM AND PRESSURE VAULT. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQs and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to insert some general questions and answers regarding the synopsis/solicitation.  Q:  With each design, there is a requirement to have a new concrete foundation with j-bolts connected to re-bar to hold the 96,000 lb force that will be present at the maximum 4 psi pressure.   Will NASA provide this facility slab modification or should it be included as an allowance in the cost proposal? A: Only provide floor attachment hardware for pressure. The floor modification is not part of this quotation. In future, we may use the hardware upon modification of the floor. We would not be testing for positive pressure (+4 psi) at this point. We would be testing for vacuum (-4 psi).  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 4/25/07.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-05-01-JT2
<RESPDATE>100108
<ARCHDATE>10162008
<CONTACT>Will Brice, Contracting Officer, Phone 321-494-9739, Fax 321-494-2680, Email willis.brice@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>MODIFICATION TO BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA):
Virginia Contracting Activity (VCA) is posting this modification to generate new concept White Paper submittals for funding consideration within realigned program objectives and mission priorities of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Officer for Technology and Fielding (DIA/DTT).  The modification also updates current Government POC?s. The total amount of funding for new project starts in FY08 and FY 09 is expected to be in the vicinity of $20M. White Papers will be accepted at any time; however, DIA/DTT funding decisions are generally made prior to May 1 for the next fiscal year which commences October 1.  To simplify the changes, this modification will incorporate the original base BAA and all changes into this modification and will supersede the original Combined Solicitation. 

BACKGROUND:
The mission of the DIA/DTT is to rapidly develop and field Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and technical collection capabilities consistent with the DIA current mission priorities. Within this framework DIA/DTT is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) collection technologies to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. DIA/DTT aims to be a premier provider of innovative MASINT and technical intelligence collection technologies as end-to-end systems able to respond to both tactical and strategic needs of the intelligence and war-fighter communities. 

AREAS OF INTEREST:
In order for organizations to gain a clearer picture of DIA/DTT?s mission requirement priorities and the technologies proposed to meet these requirements it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Ms. Susan Engel. Her unclassified email address is susan.engel@patrick.af.mil.  Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified by the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:
The Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within the general MASINT scientific disciplines. DIA/DTT is seeking White Papers that offer demonstration of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of high interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest. Development of this technology into operationally useful systems requires a wide range of scientific, engineering and technical expertise combined with knowledge of current intelligence and military requirements, capabilities, and operations. Scientific disciplines considered components of MASINT include electro-optics, radar and radio frequency, trace materials sampling, nuclear radiation, geophysics. These disciplines are augmented with expertise for systems engineering/integration with manned and unmanned air/land/water/space?based platforms, command, control and communications systems and processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) systems. For a developmental system to be successfully transitioned to real-world intelligence collection operations, it must be compatible with existing operational concepts/doctrine, processes, systems, logistical, environmental realities and force protection constraints.  

SCHEDULE:
This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (1 Nov 04 - 1 Oct 08), and is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories.  White Papers will be accepted at any time.  This BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 1 October 2008. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

WHITE PAPERS:
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  The White Paper should include the White Paper Cover Sheet (attachment 1), containing the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort.  The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed.  The White Paper does not include a cost proposal.  It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives.  It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort.  The White Paper must also include past performance data (attachment to 2-4 page white paper), in accordance with the attached instructions (attachment 2).  White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note:White Papers already submitted under BAA-04-01-JT1 or BAA-05-01-JT2, should not be resubmitted under this BAA modification. 

FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: 
The format for white papers follows below. White paper proposals that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task Objective and relevant mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration.  Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors.  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch.  Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT security guide.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award.  All white paper responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.  E-mailed white paper submissions are not accepted.  E-mailed questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors, during the white paper proposal development phase of this acquisition, should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer and must reference the title and BAA-05-01-JT2 number. White Paper Transmittal Addresses: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925.  White papers classified above the level of Secret must be directed to the Chief, Security Division, David Sorter, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, phone: 321-494-6701

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-within classified mission areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications & Capabilities.  The Mission area managers will evaluate the offeror?s proposal for improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, the offeror?s knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&D, and the offeror?s ability to rapidly respond to operational needs.  (2) Relevant Past & Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal that shall be considered. 

PROPOSALS:
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal.

AWARDS:
Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Nov 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA, from Nov 04 - Sep 09, is over $100 million.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP-SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. These offerors should immediately contact the contracting officer for information if they contemplate responding.  Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL:
All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personal (currently from ZelTech, MTC, and EWA) has signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as ?Government Access Only?.  Proposals labeled by the offerors as for ?Administrative Purposes Only? will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. All evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. Non-government staff support contractors may serve as technical advisors in the evaluation of proposals. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA):
Virginia Contracting Activity (VCA) is posting this modification to generate new concept White Paper submittals for funding consideration within realigned program objectives and mission priorities of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Officer for Technology and Fielding (DIA/DTT).  The modification also updates current Government POC?s. The total amount of funding for new project starts in FY08 and FY 09 is expected to be in the vicinity of $20M. White Papers will be accepted at any time; however, DIA/DTT funding decisions are generally made prior to May 1 for the next fiscal year which commences October 1.  To simplify the changes, this modification will incorporate the original base BAA and all changes into this modification and will supersede the original Combined Solicitation. 

BACKGROUND:
The mission of the DIA/DTT is to rapidly develop and field Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and technical collection capabilities consistent with the DIA current mission priorities. Within this framework DIA/DTT is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new Measures and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) collection technologies to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. DIA/DTT aims to be a premier provider of innovative MASINT and technical intelligence collection technologies as end-to-end systems able to respond to both tactical and strategic needs of the intelligence and war-fighter communities. 

AREAS OF INTEREST:
In order for organizations to gain a clearer picture of DIA/DTT?s mission requirement priorities and the technologies proposed to meet these requirements it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Ms. Susan Engel. Her unclassified email address is susan.engel@patrick.af.mil.  Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified by the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:
The Virginia Contracting Activity is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches within the general MASINT scientific disciplines. DIA/DTT is seeking White Papers that offer demonstration of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of high interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest. Development of this technology into operationally useful systems requires a wide range of scientific, engineering and technical expertise combined with knowledge of current intelligence and military requirements, capabilities, and operations. Scientific disciplines considered components of MASINT include electro-optics, radar and radio frequency, trace materials sampling, nuclear radiation, geophysics. These disciplines are augmented with expertise for systems engineering/integration with manned and unmanned air/land/water/space?based platforms, command, control and communications systems and processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) systems. For a developmental system to be successfully transitioned to real-world intelligence collection operations, it must be compatible with existing operational concepts/doctrine, processes, systems, logistical, environmental realities and force protection constraints.  

SCHEDULE:
This MASINT Transitional BAA is open and effective for a period of four years from the date of release (1 Nov 04 - 1 Oct 08), and is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories.  White Papers will be accepted at any time.  This BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 1 October 2008. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

WHITE PAPERS:
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  The White Paper should include the White Paper Cover Sheet (attachment 1), containing the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort.  The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed.  The White Paper does not include a cost proposal.  It must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration and the technical objectives.  It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort.  The White Paper must also include past performance data (attachment to 2-4 page white paper), in accordance with the attached instructions (attachment 2).  White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note:White Papers already submitted under BAA-04-01-JT1 or BAA-05-01-JT2, should not be resubmitted under this BAA modification. 

FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: 
The format for white papers follows below. White paper proposals that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task Objective and relevant mission areas(s) being addressed; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration.  Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors.  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch.  Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with the approved MASINT security guide.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award.  All white paper responses to this announcement must be addressed to: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.  E-mailed white paper submissions are not accepted.  E-mailed questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors, during the white paper proposal development phase of this acquisition, should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer and must reference the title and BAA-05-01-JT2 number. White Paper Transmittal Addresses: Matthew Brown, Virginia Contracting Activity, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB FL 32925.  White papers classified above the level of Secret must be directed to the Chief, Security Division, David Sorter, 1030 South Highway A1A, Building 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, phone: 321-494-6701

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
The evaluation of white papers and proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Mission Capability-within classified mission areas; Scientific/Technical Merit, Operational Feasibility, Operational Readiness and Qualifications & Capabilities.  The Mission area managers will evaluate the offeror?s proposal for improved ability to satisfy specific mission area requirements, the ability to operationally field the technology, the offeror?s knowledge, skills and technical expertise in the field of MASINT R&D, and the offeror?s ability to rapidly respond to operational needs.  (2) Relevant Past & Present performance, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government/commercial contracts, and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal that shall be considered. 

PROPOSALS:
White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal.  An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the invitation to submit a proposal.

AWARDS:
Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in Nov 04. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $3 million per year. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA, from Nov 04 - Sep 09, is over $100 million.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TOP-SECRET-SCI clearance or the means to support a special access security environment, facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to U.S. SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. These offerors should immediately contact the contracting officer for information if they contemplate responding.  Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL:
All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personal (currently from ZelTech, MTC, and EWA) has signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as ?Government Access Only?.  Proposals labeled by the offerors as for ?Administrative Purposes Only? will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. All evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. Non-government staff support contractors may serve as technical advisors in the evaluation of proposals. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

4.  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (Ft Meade/Washington DC):
  
For CLIN 0003, 1003, and 2003 these CLINS will be UPON REQUEST ONLY SERVICE ordered via task order.  The COR identified in the contract will notify the contractor of the request in advance. When a REQUEST ONLY is made, the contractor will have the option to either start in Boyers, PA or Ft. Meade, MD for that day. If OPM needs deliveries made ?on demand? OPM will notify the contractor, in which OPM has sole discretion on the starting point.  The contractor shall accomplish deliveries within the confines of the normal working hours of these facilities.  The contractor will use its discretion on the best feasible routes between facilities for on time deliveries and pickups. The contractor must submit in their proposal how many vehicles will be used under the Ft. Meade/DC service along with the primary routes being used for this product description.  In addition, when UPON REQUEST SERVICE is requested, there must be sufficient vehicles used for that day to complete both Ft Meade/Boyers and Ft Meade/DC runs.  

It is not known at this time what the anticipated amount of freight will be delivered between Ft. Meade/DC.  The contractor will be notified in advance of the approximate number of sealed boxes or lockboxes.  It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes and the use of equipment to load and unload will not be necessary. If cargo may be too oversized/ overweight, the contractor will be notified by the COR, in advance, so that the proper equipment will be utilized.  All equipment used for oversized/overweight freight will be provided for the contractor at each OPM facility.  The contractor shall not pickup/drop off other agencies or companies material while possessing OPM material. The contractor will invoice for these CLINS via task order.

The usual freight between FISD Ft. Meade and Boyers would be approx. (35) footlocker type trunks which are roughly (3) cubic feet each, locked, weighing approx. (40) pounds, but could be as much as (100) pounds each. The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of case material, paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc. Some freight from the FISD may also be in sealed boxes. It is anticipated that most cargo will be in lockboxes and the use of equipment to load and unload will not be necessary. If cargo may be too oversized/overweight, the contractor will be notified by the COR, in advance, so that the proper equipment will be utilized. All equipment used for oversized/ overweight freight will be provided for the contractor at each OPM facility. Furthermore, changes due to technology may have an impact on the number of lockboxes or sealed boxes being shipped between OPM facilities in the near future.  OPM may seek an equable adjustment for reduction in material.

Furthermore, the contractor must notify the COR of any situation pertaining to inclement weather, pandemic threats, or terrorists threats that might affect deliveries. If these situations occur and the contractor is in possession of OPM documents, the contractor must properly secure OPM documents in their OPM-approved designated warehouse or secure holding area.

In these conditions, the contractor must provide OPM a temporary alternative route plan.  THE CONTRACTOR MUST SUBMIT AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE PLAN ALONG WITH THEIR PRIMARY ROUTE PLAN IN THEIR PROPOSAL.
