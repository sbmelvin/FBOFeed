<a href="mailto:jere.scola@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) is required to replace the AN/TPS-75 radar as the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander through the Ground Theater Air Control System. The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, and theater ballistic missile detection. The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. In the case of theater missile defense operations, the new radar will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes such as the USAF Control and Reporting Center to disseminate for warning and engagement. Similarly, the joint tar! geting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, which will include launch and impact location. The 3DELRR will correct current radar system shortfalls by providing the capability to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets as well as discriminate the type of a non-cooperative aircraft. It will also mitigate most of the sustainability and maintainability concerns which plague the current system.

<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals and there will be no solicitation made available.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Contracts Group, intends to negotiate a sole-source out-of-scope modification under contract number 99CP101364E with the Grand Coulee Consortium (GCC), c/o Andritz Hydro Corp. 10735 David Taylor Drive, Suite 500, Charlotte, NC 28262.  This modification will be issued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The Government intends to issue an out of scope modification under the referenced contract with GCC and require GCC to disassemble and reassemble generator G9 located in the Left Powerplant at Grand Coulee Dam, Grand Coulee Washington.  The reason for the sole source is that GCC has recently completed rehabilitation of the G9 turbine, there is a 5 year warranty attached to that rehabilitation, and having other entities disassemble or reassemble the unit would negate said warranty.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990 and the size standard is $14 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  These statements must be received by the Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, Attn:  PN3714, 1150 N. Curtis Rd., Suite 100, Boise Idaho 83706-1234 no later than 15 days from the date this notice is posted at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>This request for proposal (RFP) outlines VISN 6s requirements for the Contractor to furnish and install an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Clinical Information Systems (CIS). VISN 6 currently has no (0) existing CIS. At all VISN sites, a combination of traditional paper charting and VistA is being used to manage the ICU and surgery patients. All sites extensively and predominantly utilize Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and VHA Barcode Medication Administration System (BCMA) for all health care documentation. Other software for the care of our patients includes VistA Imaging, Clinical Note Templates, and Health Promotion. Other CPRS- VistA programs are likely to be developed in the future and therefore the complete management system to be installed herein must have the flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of the VISN. Monitored vital sign and other electronic monitored information will be transferred automatically to the CIS flowsheet and displayed on a timeline correlated with all provided therapies. Device drivers to all VA medical devices for patient use must be capable of accepting all data, measured and calculated. It is imperative that the new CIS, and the CPRS, BCMA and all other systems co-exist as seamlessly as possible on the same workstation.VISN 6 is procuring this ICU CIS license and associated interface licenses for its clinical staff (nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, etc.) to assist them in providing clinical care to patients by acquiring real time data from physiologic monitors, infusion pumps, ventilators and other equipment used to monitor and treat patients in the critical care setting. The CIS will be used in critical care areas, including MICU, SICU, ER, PACU. This contract is for a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferrable license for an unlimited number of concurrent users in a networked environment at the identified sites.

<DESC>Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4-3, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis for the FAA's decision to contract with GTSI via single source procedures.
Procurement number; DTFAWA-06-D-00002, Modification 015Contractor Name:  GTSI, Corp.Total value of award; $18,300,000Total Potential Value of Contract:  $81,300,000Period of performance; September 11, 2009 - April 30. 2010 (award includes two additional option months to allow for transition). Name and telephone number of the technical representative;Marian Parrington, AOT-100, 609-485-6931, marian.parrington@faa.govContracting Officer's name and telephone number.Sharonda Holmes, AJA-48 202-267-7326, sharonda.holmes@faa.gov
Description of the procurement:This Single Source award is part of FAA Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies, (SAVES) IT Hardware Contract, under the primary North American Industry Classification System Code 423430 - Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers.  This contract vehicle is used by all regions within the FAA for purchasing servers, storage arrays and media, Service plans, warranties, back up management software, power, VoIP, wireless, cables, routers, and switches. 
Basis for Award Decision:This increased ceiling in the amount of $18,300,000.00 is estimated to cover 7 months, with two optional months, in order to allow for sufficient time to conduct a procurement for a replacement contract.  The Agency has determined that the cost to administer multiple awards for IT Hardware procurements would negate the savings that the Agency has already realized through the investment of the Strategic Sourcing program. The FAA intends to conduct a competitive procurement for the follow on contract. All future announcements and updates regarding the competitive procurement will be posted publicly on the FAA Contracting Opportunities website.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for continuingpost-launch technical support of the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV)instrument support. These instruments are required and essential in monitoring	the stateof the Earths ozone layer. All 3 SBUV/2 Instruments are currently flying on the NOAAPolar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System. Two of the instruments arefully operational and one is fully operational with some degradation of performance.Direct technical support is required whenever there is an observation, anomaly andinvestigation required with any of the three instruments.NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Ball Aerospace andTechnologies Corporation (BATC) for their continued technical support of theseinstruments. The resultant contract is anticipated to be awarded for a 4 year period ofperformance.BATC is uniquely qualified  for this contract. The SBUV/2 Instrument is a unique andcomplex system which was designed, developed, fabricated and tested by BATC. BATC isuniquely qualified to provide the required effort for any anomaly investigations in realtime without any learning curve or delay. Due to the operational nature of the SBUV/2instrument, real time support may be required during any investigation. Further, BATC hasreadily available to them a library of technical documents, specification and other SBUVreference material necessary to perform any required investigation, evaluation, andanalysis.Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1)- Only OneResponsible Source.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO)at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), which undertakes research and development tomaximize the impact of satellite observations in climate, weather and atmosphericcomposition prediction. Global models and their associated data assimilation systems areused to incorporate observations to improve the estimates of the state of the atmosphere,ocean, or land surface made through model simulations (state estimates). To achieve thisgoal, the GMAO undertakes model and assimilation development, generates products tosupport NASA instrument teams and NASAs Earth science program, and undertakes scientificresearch to inform system development pathways.  Assimilation systems have been developedfor the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface. The long-term goal is an Integrated EarthSystem Model and Assimilation System wherein the individual components are treated in amore interactive manner. The GMAO represents NASA as one of the partners in the JointCenter for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) with the goal of accelerating thetransition of NASA satellite information into operational applications.One of the recent meteorological products generated by the GMAO is the Modern EraRetrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) from the assimilation ofhistorical atmospheric data (from 1979 to the present). These data focus on the modernera, i.e., the satellite era. MERRA has been generated with the Goddard Earth ObservingSystem (GEOS) model, version 5 (GEOS-5) and its associated atmospheric analysis system,the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI), developed in collaboration with theNOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The GEOS-5 system software includes atool  referred to as the replay  which allows the ingest of an existing analysis,like MERRA, into the model as it is running in simulation mode. This replay thusconstrains the model close to the analysis as if it were undertaking assimilation. GEOS-5 is coupled with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART)model so that GEOS-5 meteorological states can be used to transport aerosol fields.  Itis also coupled with the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) Chemistry model so thattropospheric and stratospheric trace gases (such as ozone and carbon monoxide) can bemodeled.  The replay capability of GEOS-5 allows us to simulate aerosol and chemistryvariations consistent with GEOS-5 meteorological analyses from assimilation.The task using ARRA funds will support the GMAOs activities and the support requirementsare broken down into 3 subtasks:(a)	Progress towards an Integrated Earth System Analysis by undertaking simulationswith the GEOS-5 model coupled to both GOCART (for aerosols) and GMI (for trace gaschemistry), using the replay technique with the MERRA meteorological forcing;(b)	Advances in the assimilation of Advanced Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) and microwavelimb sounder (MLS) radiance data into the GEOS-5 atmospheric data assimilation system(DAS), and(c)	Use of MERRA to contribute to improving cloud and convection parameterizations byplacing satellite data in a meteorological context and expanding the parameter spaceexplored by a single column model (SCM) version of GEOS-5 and cloud resolving model (CRM)simulations to be conducted by the Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Branch.NASA/GSFC intends to award a new Task 22 under Contract No. NNG06HX04C with ScienceApplications International Corporation (SAIC).	Cost plus award fee Contract No.NNG06HX04C was awarded to SAIC, on December 28, 2005, on a competitive basis.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>CONTRACT REQUIREMENT: This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. These services will be acquired in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. AE services are required under an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for performance of business case analysis (BCA) support services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Silver Spring, MD. The purpose of the BCA is to identify, analyze, and recommend the most cost-effective choices among capital investment alternatives as the basis for NOAA proposed real property capital investment projects. The best qualified firm will be selected to provide BCA support services such as, but not limited to, preparing detailed analysis of potential investment alternatives that reasonably can be expected to be developed and implemented. The BCA documentation must meet the requirements of the most recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-11, Part 7, Section 300, Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition, and Management of Capital Assets.
<p>Additionally, given the nature of the BCA, it is essential to ensure an objective and unbiased analysis of alternatives to support sound investment decision-making, including avoiding any perception that the analysis could be affected by the contractor's ability to compete for any subsequent design, architecture or engineering work. In order to prevent perceptions of such conflicts of interest, or actual conflict as stated in FAR Part 9, Section 9.505, the selected contractor and all associated partners, team members, and subcontractors involved in the work under this requirement shall not be eligible to compete for any subsequent design and construction projects related to the investment project that is the subject of a specific BCA conducted by the contractor. This limitation is to ensure that the evaluation and recommendations made as a part of the BCA are not influenced in any way, either real or perceived, by opportunities for future design or construction contracts.</p>
<p>The successful firm must be able to perform work anywhere within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories. The initial list of potential BCA projects includes the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Milford Biological Laboratory (MBL), Milford, CT.<br />&bull; Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), Woods Hole, MA.<br />&bull; Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Stations (WCDAS), Wallops Island, VA.<br />&bull; Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), Miami, FL.<br />&bull; Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), Montlake, WA.</p>
<p>The base contract shall have a single five-year performance period. The performance period and completion requirements for the individual tasks shall be separately specified and negotiated for each individual task order. The anticipated capacity that will be required to address the business case analysis needs of the OCAO is approximately $1,000,000.00 per year during each of the next five years for a total of $5 million over the projected contract life. The minimum guarantee under the contract shall be $100,000.00.<br />The minimum ordering limitation for this contract shall be $10,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation shall be $1,000,000.00 for any single task order in a given calendar year. The anticipated date for this award is April 2010.<br /><br />PROJECT INFORMATION: The primary focuses for the required BCA support services are these:</p>
<p>A. Programming Analysis<br />The programming analysis, research, and decision-making processes will become the framework that identifies space requirements and future planning needs. It must document the existing space allocation and use, define the requirements of the occupants-including identifying problems and needs, and then propose space allowance and types of spaces. The principle reason for documenting the existing space square footage is to provide a reference point for future discussion on facility occupant allocations, allowances, and requirements.</p>
<p>B. Facility Condition Assessment<br />The Facility Condition Assessment includes general architectural, engineering, environmental, and life safety evaluations to collect information associated with the existing physical aspects of the buildings, structures, infrastructure, and site.</p>
<p>C. Alternative Identification, Analysis, and Recommendations<br />Alternative Identification may include a feasibility study (site and/or building layout) as proof of the alternative concept. The analysis must be prepared in accordance with the most recent OMB Circulars No. A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs, and A-11, Part 7, Section 300.</p>
<p>D. Short-Range and Long-Range Prioritization Project List<br />Based on Programming, Facility Condition Assessment, and the Alternatives Analysis, the contractor must outline an implementation strategy, based upon the existing facility use and condition, and develop a priority list of facility projects with associated estimated costs for the next 1-to-5 years (short-term) and 6-to-10 years (long-term).</p>
<p>E. Business Case Documentation<br />The final product shall be a detailed analysis of potential investment alternatives that reasonably can be expected to be developed and implemented.</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this action are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>A. Demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience in business case analysis, including examples of specialized experience in capital investment analysis, in support of major Federal government real property projects similar to the Scope of Work including, but not limited to, the following: programming, site and facility investigations and surveys, comparative analysis of alternative courses of action, feasibility studies of architectural conceptual alternatives, financial analysis of alternative courses of action, discussion and resolution of primary impacts, and identification of short and long term impacts.</p>
<p>B. Method and technical approach to Business Case Analysis.</p>
<p>C. Capacity of the firm to accomplish the work within a timely manner.</p>
<p>D. Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project, with emphasis on key personnel, including consultants and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>E. Recent past performance on previous Federal government projects, similar to that described in the Scope of Work, in terms of cost control and quality control measures.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties having the capabilities to perform this work shall submit three (3) copies of fully completed Parts I and II of the Standard Form (SF) 330. In block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, include the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier for the principal firm making the submission.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Based on the Technical review, there is reasonable technical basis to conclude that the item required by the agency is currently available only from the source, identified by their Contractor and government Entity (Cage) 78286.

<DESC>RECOVERY--THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W52H09-08-D-5005.  This notice is for a change order to remove the existing 6 rows of stringers (supporting steel members) and replace them with 4 rows, two centered under each rail in order to carry the required train loads.  Subject project was awarded to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, IA on firm fixed price task order W52H09-08-D-5005/0045 on September 27, 2009.  During construction, the ballast material was removed on the railroad deck revealing the bridge stringers.  The stringers are so corroded and in such in bad shape it has been determined that they will not carry the required loads that are necessary to support a train.  The estimated price range of this change order is between $100,000 and $250,000.  The change order will be awarded as a firm fixed price modification under task order 0045 under contract W52H09-08-D-5005.  Contract W52H09-08-D-5005 was awarded under full and open competition with the use of best value source selection procedures to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, Iowa on August 21, 2008.

<DESC>RECOVERY--Avian predation of migrating juvenile salmonids, particularly from gulls, is a common occurrence downstream of hydropower projects.  In general terms, juvenile fish passing the dam may become disoriented due to a number of factors (acceleration, change in pressure, etc.) thereby becoming increasingly vulnerable to avian predation downstream of the dam.<BR><BR>An Avian Predation Deterrent Array (APDA) in the tailrace areas have been shown to significantly reduce avian predation rates on passing juvenile salmonids.  The goal of the APDA is to provide a passive physical deterrent (wire coverage) over the entire tailrace area, from the face of the project downstream to the boat restricted zone (BRZ) to provide protection from avian predation, providing the juvenile salmonids time to recover before moving downstream.  <BR><BR>Six array support structures (anchor poles) will be required.  Three 40 ft anchor poles on the Oregon shore and three 90 ft anchor poles on navlock guidewall islands.  Carrier lines will be installed between the anchor poles, to provide intermediate anchor points for the avian lines.  Anchor pole and foundation design work will be required as part of the solicitation.<BR><BR>The typical span for a single wire will be approximately 2800 ft, while the longest span will approach 3100 ft.  The avian lines will drape across the BRZ within 40 ft above normal high tailwater (minimal sag).  <BR><BR>This will require in-water work with construction starting no earlier than 1 December 2009 and work completion no later than 15 March 2010.

<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>TITLE: External Objective Review of the Global Routine Immunization Research Agenda<br /><br />I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Childhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective of all health interventions. In the past two decades, immunization has prevented an estimated 20 million deaths globally from vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
<p>The United States has greatly reduced its burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VIPs) through childhood immunization. However, U.S. children and adults remain at risk for VIPs largely due to their widespread occurrence in other countries. Globally, more than 2 million childhood deaths from VIPs are prevented each year (2004 estimate), and an additional 600,000 hepatitis B-related deaths from liver cirrhosis and hepatoma that may otherwise have occurred in adulthood are prevented.</p>
<p>Each year, more than 130 million children are born worldwide who need immunization services. While 78% of the world's infants receive diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3) - the benchmark indicator of annual routine immunization coverage - an estimated 27 million infants remain unvaccinated. One in six children is not vaccinated against tuberculosis; 1 in 4 is not vaccinated against measles, only half of the world's infants are fully immunized against hepatitis B, and 3 in 4 are not vaccinated against Hib disease.</p>
<p>The negative impact of these gaps in immunization is enormous. An estimated 1.4 million children under age five died from the six major VPDs in 2004, with a further 1.1 million deaths from pneumococcal disease and rotavirus (vaccines that are available in the United States but rarely used in developing countries).</p>
<p>Since 1991, CDC has provided substantial financial and technical support for polio eradication and measles elimination. CDC's yearly investment in global immunization has grown from $3.1 million to $143 million in 2009. In addition, CDC currently has more than 25 staff seconded to international health organizations, such as WHO, UNICEF, Pan American Health Organization, World Bank, and the American Red Cross, providing full-time technical and operational support to priority countries and regions.</p>
<p>In keeping with this growth, CDC has a much broader role and greater influence in the field of global immunization than it did even five years ago. In addition to being a key partner in both the global polio eradication initiative and the Measles Initiative, CDC has played a critical role in developing the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy for 2006-2015 (GIVS); has a representative on the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) working group; is an implementing partner in the Hib Initiative, charged by the GAVI Alliance to assist countries to make evidence-based decisions regarding the introduction of Hib vaccine into national programs; and is supporting pilot projects in three countries to strengthen the delivery of routine immunization. <br />In addition, since CDC's last five-year strategic plan for global immunization, much has changed. There has been a renewed commitment from global partners for preventing VPDs among the world's children. This includes $4 billion from the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) over the next 10 years and a $750 million investment from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for 2006-2015. Both of these investments will support the GAVI Fund for several initiatives including supporting measles supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), strengthening immunization and health systems, eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus, establishing the polio vaccine stockpile, improving access to underused vaccines, and speeding the development and introduction of new vaccines in GAVI-eligible countries. Investment cases for introduction of rotavirus vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are under development. <br />To protect children in the United States and reduce the global burden of VPDs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports a broad range of programmatic and research efforts. CDC's experience working with domestic immunization partners provides valuable lessons and linkage with our international efforts and priorities.</p>
<p>The Strengthening Immunization Systems Branch (SISB) strives to further this global immunization mission in the following ways:<br />a. Strengthen immunization systems to deliver more vaccines, to more kids including older age groups;<br />b. Assess the impact of immunization service delivery through surveillance, monitoring of vaccine coverage, and operations research;<br />c. Test and evaluate new ideas to improve immunization services &amp; their delivery, including integration with other interventions;<br />d. Strengthen countries ability to do surveillance; and<br />e. Help build capacity of countries to make decisions for effective, efficient, and sustainable immunization programs</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE<br />To find a qualified, internationally recognized professional in the field of global immunizations to act as rapporteur for the External Objective Review of the Global Routine Immunization Research Agenda, prepare the final report of the findings and recommendations of this Review, and present the report to the Global Immunization Division scientific and technical staff.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or an obligation on the part of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the Commission) to acquire services. The Government may or may not issue solicitation documents. The Commission does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought, nor pay for the information provided. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges shall arise as a result of submission of responses to the Sources Sought and the Commission's use of such information.
<p>Description of work to be performed includes: The Commission seeks the services of a time-series econometrician having an extensive background in SAS programming to support the Commission's development of high frequency databases and systems to conduct advanced econometric analyses of those databases.</p>
<p>The advent of electronic trading has led to substantial increases in the number of contracts traded, trading volumes in those contracts along with their levels of participation. These increases pose great challenges to the Commission's ability to conduct proper oversight and analysis of trading activity. To assist in the oversight, the Commission seeks electronic systems based on rigorous econometric modeling that can associate related contracts to detect and test for trading patterns having the potential for adverse market impacts. In addition, the Commission desires expertise that will serve to advance the level of econometrics used in its analyses. Anticipated analytic methods needing development include realized volatility metrics and applications, network analysis tools and techniques, and maximum entropy modeling.</p>
<p>The Commission seeks services that can apply existing database resources to conduct necessary analyses while aiding in the Commission's development of successor databases. The Commission envisions that successor databases will facilitate the use of more advanced econometric analyses, and hence, the development of those databases must accord with the requirements of those methods.</p>
<p>Individual qualifications include: a doctoral-level degree in economics, econometrics or statistics; extensive background in SAS programming; a familiarity with high-frequency financial data. <br /><br />Responses to this notice should include: (1) company name, (2) a service capability statement, (3) ability to provide an individual that meets the qualification requirements, (4) information on published research in applied time-series analysis of high-frequency data, (5) examples of projects where you provided similar services to clients, (6) DUNS number, (7) address, (8) point of contact and the (9) size of your business (small, women-owned, etc.). Your response should not exceed ten pages.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing (email or fax) and received not later than November 9, 2009</p>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (Survey) is currently seeking sources for a new requirement to implement the Green House Gas (GHG) reduction goals.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services.
 The USGS strives to be a leader in reducing our carbon footprint and achieving the goals outlined in Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance (EO).  The USGS is currently seeking information and potential sources for a new requirement to implement the Green House Gas (GHG) reduction goals.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek information from industry to assist the agency in meeting/exceeding GHG reductions goals as outlined in the EO and in the goals set by the DOI.  Assistance includes assessing operations Bureau-wide.  Based on the assessment, provide reports outlining:
"	Develop current GHG inventory, using the EO Scopes,"	Identify barriers and recommend and prioritize options to reduce GHG,"	Resource needs to address these opportunities and possible funding sources, and"	Outline a process and timetable to reduce the GHG emissions.
Interested concerns who believe they have the capability to provide the required services as defined are invited to submit a Capability Statement, not to exceed 10 pages.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email address, business type, and approximate cost information (i.e., rough order of magnitude).  Past performance information should be submitted for projects of this nature conducted within the last three (3) years.  
To notify the Government of sensitive information, data identified as Proprietary [e.g., 41 USC section 423, the Procurement Integrity Act restrictive legend per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-1)] contained in a response to this RFI, offerors shall mark the cover page of the response and each affected page of the response with indications that it contains proprietary information.  The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a response if it is not marked proprietary.
Please submit all responses and any questions to this notice by Sunday, November 15, 2009, via email to the Contracting Officer, Karen L. Phillips, at kphillips@usgs.gov.  Responses received after this date will not be evaluated.  No feedback or evaluations will be provided regarding the information provided.

<DESC>FBO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) – Insignia Buy.
This is not a request for quotes (RFQ).

Applicable NAICS Codes:  313222 – Schiffli Machine Embroidery; 313221 – Narrow Fabric Mills; 332116 – Metal Stamping and 314999 – All Other Misc. Textile Prod

Background: The Coast Guard (CG) is a military, multi-mission maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the five armed forces. Its core missions are to protect the public, the environment and U.S. economic and security interests in maritime regions.  The HQ CG Uniform Program Office has a requirement for the acquisition of military insignia under a new contract that should be in place by early 2010. 
Requirements:  There are approximately 660 items that consist of metal and embroidery type military insignia for CG uniforms.  The insignia cover the full range of manufactured items including schiffli machinery, multi-head machinery and hand embroidery.  These insignia are manufactured to the applicable CG and MIL specifications.  
Request for Information (RFI):  The current market research shows that there is a small niche of manufacturers that produce military insignia to MIL-STD specifications.  The current research shows that the military insignia manufacturers are small businesses with no socio-economic certifications for 8(a), HubZone or Service Disabled Business.  This RFI requests that insignia manufacturers that are technically capable of producing insignia to military specifications identify themselves if they are certified as 8(a), HubZone or Service Disabled Businesses.  If you have one or more of these socio-economic certifications, submit your name, phone number and DUNS# as shown below.  A decision will then be made on the level of small business set aside for the insignia purchase based on the responses to this RFI.  Thank you.
Response Date:  5pm EST Thursday, 11/5/2009.  
Please submit responses electronically to: jim.dawson@uscg.mil

<DESC>HSCG87-10-R-PJT027 – A-E Services for Liquid Oily Waste Separator (LOWS) Facility Maintenance Project Design.  The U.S. Coast Guard has a Liquid Oily Waste System processing facility (LOWS) located at Base Support Unit (BSU) Kodiak, Alaska.  The facility was originally built in the mid-1990s, with various upgrades over the years.  The system collects and processes used oil and oily water from Coast Guard cutters, various BSU operations, and other miscellaneous sources.  The wastes are treated and separated into reclaimed oil which is used at the BSU, water that is discharged to the sanitary sewer system, and residual wastes that are shipped off island.  The current LOWS facility process generates hydrogen sulfide which has caused significant deterioration of piping, tanks and equipment, and continues to cause worker safety concerns.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to conduct a Maintenance Project to repair the deteriorated facility in the future.  The intent is to phase this project into two phases.  The initial phase is Project Scoping (with possible supplemental studies, if necessary).  The second (option) phase is for Project Design.  These two work items will be negotiated separately.  The design phase is optional at the sole discretion of the government.  However, the A-E team for this project shall consist of all disciplines necessary for both the scoping and design work.  The estimated performance period for the project scoping phase is late December 2009 to early January 2010 through mid-February to early March 2010.  The exact schedule will be negotiated with the selected firm.  Following a review and evaluation of qualification and performance data, negotiations will be commenced with the top-ranked firm on the selection list for this project.  Selection of a firm for negotiation is through an order of precedence based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional service required, as determined by applying the following criteria: 1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services; 2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials; 3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (include information as to the firm's current and projected workload and its capability to accomplish this project); 4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules (include names and phone numbers of references); 5. Location in Alaska and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  The NAICS Code is 541330. This procurement is issued on an unrestricted basis.  This is NOT a small business set-aside.  Qualified firms desiring consideration shall submit a Standard Form 330, Parts 1 and 2, prior to the close of business (4:00 PM) on November 30, 2009.  (The SF-330 may be obtained via the Internet through the GSA Electronic Forms Library at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/).  In Section F of SF-330 Part 1 list at least five example projects within the past 5 years which demonstrate the A-E’s capability to perform work of the nature anticipated by this announcement.  In Block H state why your firm is specifically qualified based on the evaluation criteria.  Also, Block H may be used to provide additional information desired by your firm.  Only the SF-330 will be reviewed.  DO NOT SEND ANY OTHER LITERATURE.  Experiences identified in Block 8 should not be more than five years old.  The SF-330 shall be annotated with the Solicitation Number HSCG87-10-R-PJT027.  Submit to the Contracting Officer, USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Attn: Ron Klaudt, P.O. Box 21747, 709 W. 9th Street, Rm. 817, Juneau, Alaska 99802-1747.  Faxed SF-330s will be accepted.  Fax to (907) 463-2416.  The sender is responsible for verification of receipt of fax transmissions.  No solicitation will be issued.  This is not a request for proposals.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
<p>Nellis AFB Las Vegas, NV, 89191 requires the lease renewal and support for five (5) each portable trailers. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to ModSpace of 5950 Emerald Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89122. ModSpace currently owns and maintains the existing leased trailers at Nellis AFB. These trailers have been installed at Nellis AFB for a number of years. In establishing a new lease, compared to renewing the existing lease, it is likely that the award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br /><br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13, Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br /><br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Notice of US Government Interest to Renew Lease

The United States Government currently occupies approximately 5,151 contiguous net usable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 118 East Main, Ashley, North Dakota.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before January 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North- 95th St SE/7th St NE
East- 49th Ave SE 
South- 97th St SE
West- Hwy 3; 48th Ave SE; 5th Ave SW; Hwy 11; 5th Ave NW

Other applicable requirements include:	
- Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
- Parking – 34 (3 with dual plug ins) on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.
4. Contact Information for Owner or Authorized Agent.

This is not a Solicitation for Offer, nor is this a request for proposal.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

WRITTEN NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY OF SPACE MUST BE SUBMITTED BY
4: 00 PM ON Friday November 6th, 2009.

Please send written expressions of interest to:

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. CLINs/SLINs X002 and X003 within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004, "Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges," will not be included in the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 will be awarded at a "Not to Exceed" (NTE) amount of the documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If during the term of the contract, the TFS's exceed the NTE amount, the contractor may submit a request for equitable adjustment (REA). The REA must document what TFS(s) changed to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued to establish a new NTE amount based upon the newly documented annual TFS plus a _% escalation.<br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Ken Marston is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract.

<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-09-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

It is the Government’s belief that only Man Diesel and Viking, Inc. can provide the parts that match form, fit, and function to Paxman original equipment (OEM) parts, therefore negotiations shall be conducted only with these two sources unless other sources can provide written confirmation that they are authorized distributors of the OEM or have previously supplied the identical parts under contract to the U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Navy.  Sources, other than identified herein, that are interested in responding to this notice must provide the following information: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics) and/or (2) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer.

This information must be received within seven (7) calendar days from the date this Notice is published.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
 


Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The Portland Area Indian Health Service, Division of Health Facilities Engineering, is seeking qualification statements of A/E firms to provide professional design services for various projects in the pacific northwest. Qualification Statements (SF-330) submitted in response to this notice will be used to select the most highly qualified AE for award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  

Professional services include planning, design, construction contract administration, and post construction contract services for various federal and tribal health facilities located in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  Health facilities include health care clinics, wellness centers, support buildings, and associated infrastructure ranging in size from 1,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet.  Under this Health Facilities Engineering (HFE) program, IHS conducts projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements.   

The work will primarily take place at federally operated facilities in eight geographic locations.

  g.  Spokane, WA

Additional work needs may occasionally be identified at tribally run health facilities.  There are several of these facilities throughout Washington, Oregon and Idaho, with the highest concentration being in Washington, then Oregon.     

The resultant contract will be for a base period of 365 calendar days with four option years that may be exercised by the Government.  IHS anticipates awarding only one contract to one firm, and may elect to set aside the project for small business concerns after the closing date for this announcement.

Services include, but are not limited to:
   
a.  Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services:  facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit coordination studies and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning activities; environmental testing and environmental site assessments; geotechnical and soil investigation and testing; water quality analysis; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR NON-PERSONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) SERVICES, ANALYSES, STUDIES, AND ENGINEERING TO FACILITATE THE CUSTOMIZATION AND APPLICATION OF VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (VE) TECHNOLOGIES TO SATISFY NAVY MISSION SIMULATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Reference Sources Sought Notice posted 15 July 2009 for Live, Virtual and Constructive Synthetic Training (LVCST) Research and Development, Solicitation Number: 0_8020_11289. Due to the broad nature of LVC, it was determined that examining Virtual Environments (VEs) would be more appropriate for this particular acquisition.

 All upcoming postings for R&D of VEs will reference solicitation Number:"N61339-10-R-0005". The acquisition strategy is to award a single contract within the requirements of North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) 541712 (size standard is 500 employees). The Government intends to utilize other than full and open competition by setting aside this award exclusively for Small Business Concerns, in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. This will be a competitive, negotiated acquisition with contract award based upon the best value “trade-off analysis” evaluation criteria stipulated in Section M of the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP). Selection of offers for award will be based on the evaluation of written proposals. The Government reserves the right to make a single award on initial offers without discussions or no award at all. The Government is using the negotiated source selection processes contained in FAR Part 15.

The Government intends to award a basic contract with a five year ordering period with no options. The total value of this procurement is estimated at $9,750,000. The basic award will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC). The contract will have provisions for Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders. The formal release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on or about 13 November 2009 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov. Please be advised that periodic access of this website is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding this procurement.  In addition, the RFP will be available for downloading on the NAWCTSD Business Opportunities website at http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  All documents and future solicitation information will be available for download via the websites listed above. The Government intends to award this contract by the end of February 2010. Interested parties are encouraged to submit questions/comments relative to the VE requirement to Metrissianne D. Rivera, Contract Specialist, Phone (407)380-4424, email metrissianne.rivera@navy.mil. The Contracting Officer, Jane Waller, may be contacted at email jane.waller@navy.mil or telephone (407)380-4017. Collect calls will not be accepted. Foreign participation is not permitted. 

It is federally mandated that all government contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR via the following URL: https://www.bpn.gov.  In addition, government contractors are required to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in Solicitations. ORCA vendors now have the ability to enter and maintain their representation and certification information, at their convenience, via the website listed above. Vendors will need to review and/or update the ORCA record when changes are necessary; annually to maintain an active status. 

Description of Service and Work to be Performed:

NAWCTSD requires VE R&D services that encompass the areas of applied research, advanced development, prototype development, and technology transfer. 
The scope of this effort includes, but is not limited to, the following tasks:  requirements analysis, engineering design, development and fabrication of Government and commercial VE technologies, integration of VE data with Government displays, and integration of other Information Technology (IT) to include computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware, etc., to meet customer requirements.
The tasks will entail a broad range of VE research focused on the development of improved VE training technologies and methodologies, and the assessment of the degree to which new VE training and integration technologies may be applied.  Detailed requirements for the VEST ID/IQC orders will be defined in the SOW for each specific Task Order (TO).
Specific technology challenges associated with VEs include: 1) Development of comprehensive, mixed reality immersive training and mission rehearsal environments, 2) Methods and standards for VE integrated, synchronized environments, 3) Multisensory presentation - visually rich, high-fidelity display augmented with aural, tactile, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues, 4) Modeling to support realistic, natural interaction among VE participants, 5) Validated methodologies for collaborative training and rehearsal VEs, 6) Web-based VE Training Systems and Development of accepted standards for VE Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A).

<DESC>The following is Additional Information for this request:


Even though the acquisition approach in the RFI states that the Government will require fixed prices for the purchase and maintenance of hardware, ECM and systems software, DOL is also interested in receiving vendor feedback on the feasibility of a fully outsourced solution.  Please identify specific information that the Government would be required to provide in order for your organization to propose a 100% vendor owned, operated, licensed, and hosted solution.  Also, please include a description of your organization’s experience in providing a fully outsourced solution and describe potential costing structures/pricing models.



Also, please note that the following are corrections to the original posting for this RFI:


1)  Section 1.2.2 first paragraph references Section 3 - since there is no Section 3, it should  read "... fixed prices required in the Acquisition Approach section, paragraph 4 above."


2)  Section 1.2.2 last sentence - Section 4.3 should be Section 1.3  DM/RM Past Performance.

Phase I is for the troubleshooting of a condensation issue experienced in the Turret Sensor Unit (TSU) in the Q2 system. Redesign and testing of the fix will be accomplished in the TSU under Phase I.

The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.302-2 and presented in the format prescribed.1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."Agency:  			U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs	Contracting Activity:		Contracting Officer (90C)					VA Medical Center Spokane					4815 N. Assembly St.					Spokane WA 992052.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  This justification and approval is for a firm-fixed price contract for the provision of Temporary Radiology Transcription services. VISN 20 is currently soliciting for a network wide Medical Transcription Service Contract. Per the Network Contract Manager, the consolidated contract award may not be completed until 2/1/2010.3.	A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value).  The contractor shall provide medical transcription services of dictated material for the Spokane, WA VA Medical Center (hereafter referred to as VA, VAMC, or the government) seven days a week, 24 hours a day, within prescribed turn-around-times.  Contractor will transcribe reports utilizing headers and footers and appropriate formats. All dictated reports shall be transcribed off line and then upload directly into VISTA. Reports shall be uploaded into VISTA in a timely manner as to meet the required turn-around-times identified herein. Batch uploading will not be allowed.       Cost estimated at $20,000.00.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is FAR Part 6.302-1(b) (1)(i) (services available from only one source) 5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Radiology Transcription services are a very import clinical support service that can affect patient care and safety. All Radiology Transcription services for the VAMC Spokane would cease if we could not obtain this bridge contract. VISN 20 is currently soliciting for a network wide contract which was schedule for award prior to 9/30/2009. However, the new consolidated contract will not be awarded until 2/1/2010. Due to clinical requirements and patient safety issues the VAMC Spokane needs to issue a bridge Temporary Radiology Transcription services Purchase Order for three month gap period or until the VISN 20 contract is awarded. 6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FBO notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This procurement is estimated at $20,000.00, and a notice will not be posted.7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  Pricing has been offered at the current rate from CMT. This rate has been determined fair and reasonable based on past competition.8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Per FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other to the Government", Radiology Transcription services is a critical patient care and safety service.9.	Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition.  Per FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other to the Government", Radiology Transcription services is a critical patient care and safety service.10.	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  None.11.	A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  This purchase order will only be temporary until a new VISN 20 contract is awarded.12.	I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.Brian A.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open CompetitionPer the requirements set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Parts 6.302, 6.303, and 6.304 the following justification and approval is made regarding the procurement for Temporary General Medical Transcription services for 90 days.This is sole source procurement and competitive procedures will not be used.  The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.302-2 and presented in the format prescribed.1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."Agency:  			U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs	Contracting Activity:		Contracting Officer (90C)					VA Medical Center Spokane					4815 N. Assembly St.					Spokane WA 992052.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  This justification and approval is for a firm-fixed price contract for the provision of General Medical transcription services. VISN 20 is currently soliciting for a network wide medical Transcription Service Contract. Per the Network Contract Manager, the consolidated contract award may not be completed until 2/1/2010.3.	A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value).  The contractor shall provide medical transcription services of dictated material for the Spokane, WA VA Medical Center (hereafter referred to as VA, VAMC, or the government) seven days a week, 24 hours a day, within prescribed turn-around-times.  Contractor will transcribe reports utilizing headers and footers and appropriate formats. All dictated reports shall be transcribed off line and then upload directly into VISTA. Reports shall be uploaded into VISTA in a timely manner as to meet the required turn-around-times identified herein. Batch uploading will not be allowed.       Cost estimated at $12,000.00.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is FAR Part 6.302-1(b) (1)(i) (services available from only one source) 5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  Medical Transcription services are a very import clinical support service that can affect patient care and safety. All Medical Transcription Services for the VAMC Spokane would cease if we could not obtain this bridge contract. VISN 20 is currently soliciting for a network wide contract which was schedule for award prior to 9/30/2009. However, the new consolidated contract will not be awarded until 2/1/2010. Due to clinical requirements and patient safety issues the VAMC Spokane needs to issue a bridge Medical Transcription Services Purchase Order for three month gap period or until the VISN 20 contract is awarded. 6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FBO notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  This procurement is estimated at $12,000.00, and a notice will not be posted.7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  Pricing has been offered at the current rate from CMT. This rate has been determined fair and reasonable based on past competition.8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Per FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other to the Government", Medical Transcription is a critical patient care and safety service.9.	Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition.  Per FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2) states that "Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other to the Government", Medical Transcription is a critical patient care and safety service.10.	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  None.11.	A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  This purchase order will only be temporary until a new VISN 20 contract is awarded.12.	I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that this procurement action is made in good faith with regard for the public interest.Brian A.
