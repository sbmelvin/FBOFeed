No competitive solicitation is available for this procurement.

INSTEAD, IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THE SALVAGE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY NAVY PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES, THE SALVAGE CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO A SCHEDULE OF CURRENT PER DIEM RATES AND ALLOWABLE EXPENSES AS ESTABLISHED BY THE NAVY’S SUPERVISOR OF SALVAGE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL SUCH AMOUNT EXCEED A MAXIMUM CLAIM OF $25,000 PER DAY.

(3) IN THOSE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE NAVY UTILIZES CONTRACTED RESOURCES TO DELIVER ASSISTANCE, OWNER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTUAL DAILY RATE CHARGED TO THE NAVY BY THE CONTRACTOR(S).

(4) IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS LIMITED SUPERVISOR OF SALVAGE CLAIM IS ASSERTED AGAINST THE VESSEL ONLY, IS SOLELY FOR THE VESSEL'S ACCOUNT, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AMOUNTS FOR THE SALVAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CARGO.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is contemplating extending its contract with Florida International University (FIU), Contract No. 524-C-00-99-00011-00, under the sole source authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. This contract was competed under full and open competition and its original purpose will remain unchanged.  The modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly specialized services in working with the judges and other judicial personnel until the Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) reaches full implementation in the year 2005, and the contract for a new successor project is awarded. 
This modification will also extend the completion date of the contract by 21 months, from January 11, 2004 to October 10, 2005.
The principal objective of this activity is to:1) strengthen the capacity and organization of the judicial sector in carrying out their responsibilities under the Criminal Procedures Code and the Criminal Code; 2) increase public awareness and NGO networking in promotion of access to justice; and 3) support the implementation of merit-based selection, promotion and sanction of judges. Florida International University is uniquely qualified to provide the assistance to be offered under the proposed extension, for the following reasons:  1) FIU is the only entity that has participated fully in the development of the two key pieces of legislation included in the Nicaraguan justice reform, thus it has a unique knowledge of and familiarity with this legislation; 2) FIU has unique experience in having accompanied the justice reform implementation process in Nicaragua thus far, including developing excellent working relationships with colleagues and counterparts in the judicial branch; and 3) extension of the contract with FIU will avoid incurring substantial additional costs and delays that could irreparably damage U.S. Government objectives in Nicaragua. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement in accordance with Numbered Note 22.  Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), in collaboration with the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) intends to award fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a  written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  The Government will award a Purchase Order  resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE :From the date of Purchase Order award through March 1, 2006.  BACKGROUND:  The Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in collaboration with Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for preparing the national greenhouse gas inventory estimates for the United States. As a result of attained experience, CPPD/CAMD  staff participate internationally to help other countries improve the quality and accuracy of their national greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with accepted international standards? while at the same time, meeting EPA's goal to improve the monitoring of global emissions of greenhouse gases.   In October 2003, CAMD received funds from USAID via the Office of International Activities to help seven Central American countries (Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) improve their capacity to prepare greenhouse gas inventories.  The funding will be used by  CPPD/CAMD to carry out a three year, comprehensive inventory improvement project aimed at building institutional capacity in each country.  In addition, the project aims to improve the quality of data and the methods used in the Central American region to estimate greenhouse gas emissions/removals  from selected sources/sinks.  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Under this Purchase Order the Contractor shall assist in developing improved estimates of soil carbon flux and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils using approaches that are compatible with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) Revised 1996 Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as updated by the Good Practice Guidance for both Agriculture and LULUCF.  The Contractor shall provide assistance in documenting test results, developing uncertainty estimates, evaluating mitigation options and training selected  experts from each country on the methodologies or models used to develop the estimates.  TASK DESCRIPTION AND DELIVERABLES: Task 1.  Workshop in San Salvador, El Salvador ?  February 4-6, 2004  On February 4-6, 2004, a "kick-off" workshop will be held in San Salvador, El Salvador.  This workshop  will serve as the initial meeting for the three-year greenhouse gas inventory capacity building project in Central America.  Participants from the seven Central American countries (Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama), and technical specialists from the United  States and Mexico will participate in the workshop.   For this workshop, the Contractor shall attend the meeting and describe the methodology and models they intend to utilize in developing the soil carbon and nitrous oxide estimates for each country.  Additionally, the Contractor shall interact  with the experts from each of the countries to develop a work plan for implementing  the project over an 18-24 month period .  The meeting will have simultaneous Spanish/English translation.  The desired outcome of the workshop will be a work plan for improving the country estimates for both  nitrous oxide and carbon in agricultural soils.  The final plan resulting from the meeting must meet the needs of each participating country but also conform to the budget and time constraints of the project.  Several approaches have been suggested in the agreement between EPA and USAID  including  the use of static IPCC approaches and the use of dynamic soil process models.  The final choice of which approach or mix of approaches to use will depend upon numerous country-specific, and region-specific factors such as: 1.) the goals of each country; 2.) the availability of data for each country  that is required to prepare more accurate estimates (soils, crop types, management systems, climate, etc.); 3.) the technical capabilities of the people preparing the inventory; 4.) the level of collaboration desired between each of the countries; and 5.) the funding available for the project.   These and other factors will influence the outcome of the work plan developed at the workshop.  For the initial part of the workshop the Contractor shall provide an overview of the approaches in order to familiarize the in-country experts with the different approaches.  The Contractor shall then  facilitate an open discussion to get feedback from the various country representatives on their ideas and preferences.  In addition, EPA has asked each of the countries to prepare short briefings on the current state of their Agricultural Soil Inventories and their ideas for improving this  component to be presented at the workshop.  Following the discussion and presentation phase, the Contractor shall aid in developing a detailed outline of the work to take place, including the assigning of responsibilities to individuals and a time line of activities. The EPA has asked each of the  seven countries to invite experts with a range of qualifications to the meeting.  Due to budgetary constraints, the countries will only be sending three representatives.  At least one or two of these participants will have expertise in agriculture and the agricultural component of the greenhouse  gas inventory, such as crop experts or experts in ecosystem process models. Task 2.  Develop Improved Estimates of Soil Carbon Flux and Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural Soils for Each of the Seven Central American Countries.  As part of the development process of this project, EPA proposed  to each of the countries several alternative approaches for improving the estimates of soil carbon flux and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils.  These alternative approaches ranged from the IPCC methodologies using improved data inputs and updates recently completed by the IPCC (e.g.,  Good Practice Guidance for Agriculture and LULUCF), to the use of dynamic soil process models.  Following the initial meetings held with the inventory experts from each of the countries,  most of the countries may prefer using the soil process models, in combination with parallel estimates being  developed using the latest IPCC methodologies.  The Contractor shall work with each of the countries to implement the methodologies that are agreed upon at the February 4-6, 2004 workshop.  During the process of implementing the agreed upon methodologies, Contractor shall make one to two site  visits to each of the countries. in order to gather data and collaborate with the designated in-country inventory experts. The generic approaches for improving estimates of both soil carbon and nitrous oxide, as described to each of the countries during initial site visits by EPA personnel, are  shown below.  (Soil Carbon)  Agricultural soil carbon is a  major component of greenhouse gas inventories in Central America.  The following are two approaches to estimating soil carbon stocks: 1.) the IPCC default methodology, which is a ?static' approach, and 2:) a dynamic ecosystem simulation  model approach. For this project, the Contractor shall assist EPA to work collaboratively with experts in each Central American country to determine which approach best suits their needs and national circumstances.  Both approaches require collection of basic background data on land-use/land-cover  and soil types, therefore requiring Step 1 regardless of the final methodology chosen:Step 1: Stratification of land use/land cover by soil type:  Accounting for areas and changes in areas of land under different uses is fundamental to any inventory activity.  Remote sensing (satellite, aerial  photography), together with ground-based survey data, are typically employed to determine land cover. Country-level land cover maps developed collaboratively by NASA and Central American colleagues may be used.  However, to effectively account for biomass and soil C stock changes, land cover needs  to be further stratified by major types of soils and landforms.  This typically requires use of soil survey-type data (i.e. soil maps and soil classification).In collaboration with EPA and researchers from each of the Central American countries, the Contractor shall undertake the following tasks to  improve their land use and land cover databases: Compile and review currently available soil survey data. Determine adequacy of country-level soil maps, and compare with FAO soil map. Develop, or apply existing GIS soil coverage for overlay with land cover/land use data.  Make initial  stratification of soil types by land cover/land use types. Step 2:  Option A ? The IPCC Methodology The IPCC methodology for estimating changes in agricultural soil carbon stocks has not been applied comprehensively in Central America, but other countries have found that the default IPCC values for  carbon stocks and management factors do not reflect their specific combinations of climate, soil and land management conditions.  The following proposed steps and tasks may be undertaken to implement a country-specific application of the IPCC methodology for each of the countries:a)	Compilation of  data for reference C stock determination:  Reference carbon stocks, by major climate and soils types are needed for applying IPCC inventory methods.  Global default values exist but country-specific data (i.e. Tier 2 approaches) can reduce uncertainty and improve the value of the inventory  considerably.  Reference stocks can be estimated from soil profiles under native vegetation as well as on managed land (provided land use history is known), or both.  Considerable data are typically available from soil surveys or other sources ? however, evaluation and classification of the data  may be necessary for its use in inventories.  In combination with researchers from Central America and EPA, the Contractor shall undertake the following tasks to improve the data on reference C stocks: Review available in-country soil pedon data, taxonomic system and measured soil attributes; Query  international pedon data sources (e.g. ISRIC, USDA) for applicable soils; Determine most appropriate classification scheme for inventory purposes (cf. IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF); Classify and analyze data according to classification system b)	Stock change/emission factor determination:  Information on how soil C stocks change as a function of land use and management changes, for specific soil types and climate regimes, is key to any inventory methodology.  The IPCC default approach employs stock change factors that are used in conjunction with the reference soil C stocks.  Field  data from long-term experiments, re-measured permanent plots or field chronosequences (for land use change) that are applicable for a country or region could be compiled, quality controlled and used to improve estimates of stock change factors.  Estimating country/region specific stock change  factors would enable countries to advance to a Tier 2 IPCC inventory approach.  In addition, a compilation of such studies would also support application of more advanced approaches such as simulation models. In collaboration with researchers from Central America and EPA the Contractor shall  undertake the following tasks to improve the data on stock change/emission factor determination: Discussions with in-country scientists and experts to ascertain what information is already available (since there may be studies that have not been published or have been published in the ?gray'  literature, e.g. station reports, agency bulletins); Identify information gaps, i.e. key systems or soil types for which information is lacking, and which could possibly be addressed with targeted field studies; Compile and perform quality control on field study data; Do statistical analyses to  derive factor values. c)	Support for inventory calculations:  Once activity data and inventory methods have been refined, inventory calculations can be carried out.  Depending on the level of detail, the complexity and large data amounts may benefit from the use of different software tools and data  base programs.EPA and its Contractors, in collaboration with researchers from Central America, may undertake the following tasks to develop the inventory estimates for soil carbon.Develop database for land management areas and area changes, classified by soil and climate; Or, high-resolution  GIS-based records of land management changes over time; Populate ?IPCC stock change estimation tool' (developed for the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF) with reference stocks and stock change factors and land use systems; Support with formal uncertainty estimation procedures. Option B ?  Dynamic Eco-system Simulation Model  In the United States, researchers have developed several dynamic ecosystem simulation models that compute annual changes in soil carbon stocks as a function of inputs of carbon to soil (i.e., crop residues, manure, sewage etc.,) and soil carbon decomposition  rates, which are governed by climate and soil factors as well as management practices.  These models simulate major field crops (maize, wheat, soybean, sorghum, cotton etc.) as well as hay and pasture (grass, alfalfa, clover).  Management variables include tillage, fertilization, irrigation,  drainage, and manure addition.The Contractor shall work with EPA and experts in Central America to adapt one of these simulation models to local conditions in order that each Central American country can use the model to estimate annual changes in agricultural soil carbon stocks.  This work shall  be a collaborative effort between U.S. and Central American agriculture experts to determine the appropriate inputs for the model and to prepare a customized version of the model that can be updated and used in later years for making inventory estimates. The Contractor shall provide training on the  model in order to ensure in-country expertise regarding its operational capacity. (Nitrous Oxide)Agricultural soils are a large source of nitrous oxide emissions for Central American countries.  The IPCC methodology for estimating nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils is based on use of  parameters that may not be representative of conditions (e.g., climate, soils type, management) in Central America.  The collection of activity data is a difficult and time-consuming task that can greatly affect estimates. In the United States, researchers have developed several dynamic ecosystem  simulation models that compute emissions of nitrous oxide.  The models simulate major field crops (maize, wheat, soybean, sorghum, cotton etc.) as well as hay and pasture (grass, alfalfa, clover).  Management variables typically include soil type, temperature, precipitation, tillage, nitrogen  inputs, irrigation, and drainage.  By collaboratively running the model for the local conditions in the seven countries, specific factors can be obtained for leaching, volatilization, and nitrous oxide emissions that can be utilized with the IPCC methodology and greatly improve the accuracy of  overall estimate from this source, as opposed to using the default values provided with the IPCC method.  Alternatively, depending on data availability, the model could be run in such as way that a comprehensive estimate of nitrous oxide emissions is developed for the country.  The Contractor shall  work collaboratively with EPA and experts in Central America to adapt one of these models to local conditions, so that each country can use the model to estimate and develop country-specific emission factors for nitrous oxide and estimate nitrous oxide emission with the model alone.  This work will  be a collaborative effort between U.S. and Central American  scientists to determine the appropriate inputs for the model in order to make inventory estimates.  Task 3.  Prepare Documentation and Uncertainty Estimates of the Methodologies Used to Estimate Soil Carbon Flux and Nitrous Oxide  Emissions.  The estimates of soil carbon and nitrous oxide developed for each of the countries under this project will be used by the countries in their upcoming National Communications, as part of their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  In order for the  estimates to be useful for this purpose there must be sufficient documentation describing the methods, data sources and uncertainty ranges. Therefore, the Contractor shall assist the inventory experts in each of the countries to prepare this documentation and associated uncertainty estimates. The  Contractor shall refer to the appropriate guidance prepared by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for guidance on documentation of National Communications, and for methodologies to develop uncertainty estimates.  Task 4.  Mitigation analyses  Depending upon the  inventory methodologies agreed upon by each country at the February 4-6 Workshop, it may be possible to assist countries in evaluating various mitigation strategies.  This could include a variety of

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotations (RML-RFQ-4010). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-17, dated 10/20/03. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code  for this procurement is 511210 and the size standard is $21.0.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) proposes to procure a software program for the analysis of 2-D gel images derived from a variety of detection methods.  It is mandatory that the software have the following capabilities:  1) Spot detection must have the potential to be carried out by an analysis wizard.  The wizard must be capable of carrying out multiple detections under different parameters simultaneously.  Spots on 2-D gels shall be detected using complex algorithms that can distinguish closely related spots.  A cluster of spots difficult to differentiate must have the ability to be selected as an area of interest for further study.  When manual or automatic changes occur, detection spots are automatically renumbered and the associated database is updated.  When the user is examining the spots detected, the following features are required: zoom, contrast, brightness, and color.  The user must be able to overlay multiple previously detected images to compare spots whether zoomed or native.  The spot detection wizard must adjust to different gel running conditions, as well as, manual selection of spots. The spot detection aspect of this software must contain a manual or automatic feature to remove large noise particles from the final analysis.  The ability to differentiate a true spot from a dust particle shall be critical.  Software without this feature, but has an upgrade containing this feature, shall also be considered.  2) Spots that are detected must have the ability to be edited.  The spot editing aspect to software must contain manual editing tools, as well as, spot drawing and erasing tools.  There must exist the ability to manually add both single spots, or groups of spots from the original image or other images.  From the spot detection function, each spot shall have a given contour representing the outermost limit to the spots resolution.  This contour must be capable of being either increased or decreased manually.  A contoured spot must be capable of splitting manually.  All tools must have an undo function.  The spot editing suite must contain a feature that monitors changes and applied filters to alert the user of any complications or clashes that might occur during analysis.  Edited spots must be updated to the associated database.  Gel images must have the ability to be manually warped to facilitate multiple image comparisons.  After spots are edited, a spot editing merge function is necessary.  3) The background of each image must also have the ability to be edited based on a variety of standards.  First, an adjustable mode of non-spot subtraction is necessary.  Second, a lowest and average on boundary subtraction is required.  Third, a manual mode for selection of a given area to be background, followed by subtraction.  4) Images that have had spots detected, undergone editing, and background subtraction must now be able to have those spots quantitated.  Quantitation shall occur automatically after detection, and be updated as editing changes are made.  The data shall be displayed as the quantity from a single spot on a given gel or multiple gels.  From this comparison, multiple spot fields shall be displayed simultaneously highlighting differences.  As a function of quantitation, spots should be annotated.  It is also necessary to either show or hide the spot numbers to facilitate viewing.  All of these functions must have the ability to be manipulated as tabs within the viewing window so  only the tabs of interest are present, when you need them.  5) Individual images that have undergone the above analysis must be capable of being compared to each other.  Primarily this function must have a highly accurate automated matching system.  Manual matching methods are also required: overlay matching, dual window matching, and montage matching.  Whether automated or manual, the matching parameters must be adjustable by the user.  The user shall also have the ability to select a reference gel that can be used in multiple comparison experiments.  After image comparison, the software must have the ability to add new spots to the reference gel, which shall instantaneously generate new measurements for the reference gel data and the matched gel data.  Matching suite must have the ability to view match vectors.  Individual images within matches shall be capable of being edited and warped.  6) The software shall calibrate both the MW and pI of a given 2-D gel.  This generated ladder must have flexible placement, multiple curve fitting options, and user defined units.  This ladder shall have the ability to be linked to the reference image so that all gels compared to the reference become automatically calibrated.  This feature shall have the ability to normalize spots with a manually set normalization value.  Normalization shall occur to single or multiple spots, group average or collective volume.  7) After matching an unlimited set of gels into groups, based on some threshold of similarity, those matched groups shall be capable of being averaged into representative images of groups of gel images.  Gel images shall be added or removed from the group of gels that compose an average gel image while automatically updating the database and averaged image.  The deviation of matched spots between images must be expressed as coefficient of variation, standard error of mean, and percentage of SEM.  8)  The data must be visualized easily and under a variety of use selected conditions.  Images shall have the potential to be viewed individually or as a montage.  Simultaneous visualization of histograms, expression tables, difference maps, saturation maps, 3D image, profile, and zoomed windows are necessary.  These images and tables should be linked dynamically so changes made to one area are reflected in the appropriate other areas. The number of matches for each reference spot, versus all of the gels displayed with a comparison, shall be made available in the form of a separate window.  This must be organized into a user friendly and hardware friendly package.  9) The user shall have the ability to match image pixel values to known optical densities.  The calibration curve generated from these values shall be viewed by the user.  The software, as a means to self calibrate intensity between hardware shall include various curve-fitting algorithms.  10) These analyses shall generate considerable amounts of data, which must be navigated with ease. Viewing data as a tree structure shall be the best configuration.  From this file navigation system, experiments shall be created by moving files. Created experiments must be capable of handling an unlimited number of images per experiment.  Files shall be dynamically linked to open experiments so that changes or experiments in process are automatically updated. Batch processing of multiple files shall also be processed by simply selecting the desired files, and clicking the desired function.  11) The 2-D analysis software shall interact and query federated databases via the internet, and be integrated with an automated web page builder.  12) The images and data must be easily imported and exported through a windows based operating system.  Images and data shall be copied to the windows clipboard as well as other formats.  Tables shall be exported as .csv files or direct to Microsoft Excel.  Images must have the ability to be exported as either .bmp or .jpeg files.  Reports generated from the data analysis shall be exported as RTF or HTML formats.  Entire experiments shall be exported in XML formats.  Software shall export pick lists to variety spot pickers such as the Ettan, ProPic, GelPix, Proteineer sp, KBiosystems, and Proxcision.  Protein spots that have been picked shall be flagged on the respective gel image to show their selection.  13) The 2-D analysis software shall support multiple image file formats such as .tif, .tiff, .gel, and .img.  Both 8 and 16 bit grayscale images of any size shall be accepted.   The software shall have an auto recovery feature in case of system failure.  Original images shall remain unchanged and stored as separate files, while the edited, merged and averaged files compose a separate file.  The user shall have the ability to create an analysis template with defined parameters that can be used to perform repeated identical analyses.  The user shall perform all of the above analyses using images with inverted intensity. The following are required options: the ability to customize the display, printing options, change the order of analysis, and reorder the tables generated during an analysis.  All features described should be available through,  pull down menus, and a user definable tool bar. The software shall have a built-in help feature, as well as, tutorial images, cues and warning dialogs.  The user shall be capable of incorporating shortcut keys to the main window.  Images shall be annotated using free floating or spot anchored text.  14) The 2-D analysis software package shall include a statistical and data mining suite, to facilitate data query and analysis.  The user shall be capable of querying any aspect of data in the database using natural language, and not proprietary database jargon.  Queries shall be saved enabling repeat queries to be performed on new data sets.  The user must be able to design expression queries with a graphical query design system, which will facilitate identifying design expression patterns within the database.  This aspect of the software shall identify up-regulated, down-regulated, and unique spots for a given analysis.  The data mining feature shall facilitate the creation of batch queries for batch processing, so experiments can be carried out without the user interaction.  The software must also be capable of feeding the output of one query into the input of the next query, for drill-down analysis.  The user must also be able to compare gels and sets of gels (without limit) for significant differences.  The following statistical tests shall be required: paired t-test, variance ratio test,  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Dunnett’s, and Kruskall-Wallis test.  The data mining feature shall facilitate the analysis of large numbers of gel images or groups of spots, while rapidly identifying interesting parameters.  The software shall perform principle component and correspondence analysis.  When analyzing spot clusters, the software shall be capable of identifying groups of similar spots or gels, as well as, outliers, creating the k-medians of the hierarchical clustering.  The software shall keep track of these analyses with automatic saving and organization by dataset.   The software shall be licensed to enable it to be entirely or partially installed on an additional computer for editing.  There shall be a security login required to view all data. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

Electrical distribution system: Power is supplied power by Utah Power and Light over two 46.1 kV overhead transmission lines. Other electric providers to remote areas include: Wells Rural Electric, Bridger Valley Electric, Raft River Electric, and Mt. Wheeler Electric. The main base distribution includes approximately 200 miles of 12.0 kV circuts, two-thirds of which are overhead and one-third underground. The overhead portion is mostly bare copper conductors suspended on wood poles. The underground portion consists of cable in duct banks, although there is some direct burial cable. Pole- or pad-mounted transformers are used to step the voltage down to the required utilization level. Four substations are controlled by a “Supervisory Controlled Automated Data Acquisition” (SCADA) computer system. Typical utilization voltages are 277/480-volt three-phase, 120/208-volt three-phase and 120/240 volt single-phase. The electrical system includes street and traffic lighting along with airfield lighting and security lighting. Natural gas distribution system: Gas is delivered to several delivery and metering points around the perimeter of the base by Questar Gas Company, with the primary supplier being IGI Resources of Idaho. Gas is delivered at a pressure of 350 pounds, while distribution on base is primarily underground at a pressure of 35 pounds. There are approximately 44 miles of underground piping in sizes ranging from ¾ to 8”, 70 gas meters, and 1500 regulators (200 of which have been recently replaced). Approximately 80% of the underground system is polyethylene installed in the past ten years. The remaining 20% is 14-year-old steel pipe serving several housing areas. Natural Gas is also provided to Little Mountain and UTTR North, each with one delivery point that is regulated and metered. Water distribution system: Water is produced on base by six permitted wells; and additional three wells must be repaired. Water treatment is by chlorination, fluoridation and phosphate added at each well. Supplementary potable water is supplied by the Weber Basin Conservancy District. There are approximately 187 miles of distribution piping in the main systems, including cast iron, asbestos-cement and polyvinyl chloride pipes ranging in size from 1 ½ to 24” in diameter, as well as approximately 13,000 valves. The potable water system includes approximately 1200 back flow preventers, an automated lawn irrigation system and three swimming polls. Storage is provided by one elevated metal tank, two ground level metal tanks, and three below-ground concrete tanks, with tank sizes ranging from .8 to 3.5 million gallons. The main system was originally constructed in the 1940’s and expanded in the 1950’s and 1960’s. In addition to the major system on base, two minor systems serve Little Mountain and UTTR North. Wastewater collection system: The wastewater utility consists of on major system on base and two minor systems at Little Mountain and UTTR North; these systems were originally constructed in the 1940’s and expanded in the 1950’s and 1960’s. Wastewater from the main base is discharged to the North Davis County sanitary sewer system through four flow meters. The main system includes 19 pump stations, 14 septic tank systems and 4 holding tanks; the main system also includes approximately 200 miles of vitrified clay, polyvinyl chloride and cast iron piping ranging in size from 4” to 15” in diameter.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Project Title: 	Guidance on the Use of Gel Flocculants to Reduce Sediment Runoff Due to Roadway Construction
Statement of Problem:
Managing roadway construction project sediment runoff is a problem on most projects for the responsible parties.  Many times projects include in-stream work where sediment laden construction water runoff has the opportunity to enter waters containing sensitive and protected species. Keeping the turbidity levels of project runoff water to that which is acceptable to regulatory agencies requires separating sediment from runoff water and collecting it.  In most cases this proves to be extremely difficult regardless of cost.  The methods that have been available in the past to mitigate turbid runoff water have been at times unreliable and of questionable benefit.  This has left roadway builders, engineers, and managers to look for better solutions.  

Traditional measures to manage or mitigate sediment runoff include straw bale barriers, silt fence, filter fabric, detention ponds and infiltration basins.  A recent advancement in sediment runoff treatment utilizes fast acting flocculants.  These flocculants bond to sediment and force it to fall out of suspension.  The sediment can be captured either in sand filters or be allowed to fall out onto biofiltration areas.  Currently several different flocculent sediment removal approaches are being implemented for both roadway and facilities construction.  

The design and construction community lacks clear guidance in implementing this new technology.  A comprehensive user’s guide for gel flocculants needs to be developed to help utilize the technology in the control of silt, to facilitate specification development and aid construction engineers in identifying control measures for specific soil and hydraulic conditions.  The net result is less silt intrusion in sensitive areas and better control of runoff.
Implementation Objectives (Scope of Work):
The objective of this study is to synthesis the use of gel flocculant methods pertaining to turbidity reduction of construction site runoff water and to develop best management practices for implementation.   Specific activities to achieve the project goals are to: (1) conduct a review of published information to summarize the performance of gel flocculants; (2) interview knowledgeable individuals to identify problems and needs specific to FHWA and collect current unpublished information; (3) evaluate gel flocculants and treatment types in multiple field sites in different conditions of substrate and climate by collecting qualitative and quantitative data; (4) prepare guidelines and best management practices for using gel flocculants and associated treatment methods; (5) prepare meaningful specifications for the use of gel flocculant technology on FHWA projects; and (6) prepare final report and summary reports.  By performing this study, it is intended that the results will become policy and technical guidance for designers, geotechnical staff and construction engineers.

To assist in the objective, the FHWA will form a “Technical Committee”, composed of FHWA staff and other transportation agencies to review and comment on content, including additions, deletions, or modifications. 

The content of the guide should include a thorough description of the technology including an introduction to storm water treatment.  In addition the guide should evaluate the effects of site characteristics (soil type, climatic conditions, topography, existing vegetation) and site hydraulics, flocculent water treatment processes, designing and sizing flocculent water treatment systems (passive and active systems), flocculent water treatment system operations and maintenance, Best Management Practices, and specifications.  The guide should be useful in both the design and construction phase of most roadway projects.
Tasks:
Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the study. The FHWA is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the deployment. Proposers are expected to describe deployment plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposer’s current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objective.
At a minimum, the proposed scope of work shall include the following tasks:

1.	Conduct a literature search to identify the current techniques, uses, methods, and procedures.  Define severe weather impact on storm water treatment.
2.	Summarize the recent performance of gel flocculants for the treatment of construction site runoff water.  The study should include as many cases as possible involving gel flocculants in highway construction projects over the last 10 years.
3.	The collection of qualitative and quantitative data from multiple construction projects representing various substrate and climates. The FHWA projects may be located within Alaska, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Washington region.  Document the treatment design, field operation, project performance goals, performance information such as sediment load reduction, costs and summarize advantages and limitations.  Video documentation should be included. 
4.	Develop Best Management Practices for the technology.
5.	Review the FLH’s specification format at http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov/design/flh_ref.htm and provide appropriate specification for the gel flocculant material and treatment method to be included in future construction contracts.  
6.	Develop a work plan that provides details on the proposed guide content and methodology to obtain study information 30 days after commencement of the study.
7.	Submit a draft report within 12 months after commencement of the study with findings and recommendations.
8.	Attend two meetings of the Technical Committee in Vancouver, Washington. The first meeting will be after the Notice to Proceed and the second meeting will be after the Technical Committee has reviewed the draft report.
9.	Meet with the technical panel via teleconference monthly to review progress.
10.	Submit a final report in the form of a camera-ready copy and in the electronic format of MS Word.
11.	Present a PowerPoint training presentation to the technical panel and other FLH personnel to demonstrate results of the study.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.

The solicitation is being extended to allow the posting of additional Answers to Questions on Dec 11.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  The proposed acquisition is set aside 100% for HUBZone enterprises.

Fabrication of rib-stiffened panels for buckling tests.    The purpose of the panels will be to support aging aircraft research.  A number of panel buckling tests must be performed to assess the effects of corrosion grind-outs on the buckling strength of rib stiffened panels.

This effort is only for the fabrication and shipping of the panels to be tested.  Because the panels are to be used for buckling tests, it is of the utmost importance that the panels and stringers, in the assembled configuration, are flat.  It is also important that the ends of the panels (ends having the cut stiffener ends) are parallel to each other and flat, and that the stiffener ends are flush with the panel ends.  Compressive buckling loads will be applied at the ends of the flat panels through a flat surface.

Panel fabrication.  The contractor shall fabricate eighteen (18) panels in accordance with drawings.  Nine (9) of the panels shall be in configuration #1, and nine (9) of the panels shall be in configuration #2.  The panels shall be assembled from aluminum alloy 7075-T6.

Partial assembly.  Six (6) of the configuration #1 panels will be partially assembled:  the center stiffener will not be attached to the panel.  However, the holes will be drilled in both the panel and the stiffener in order to facilitate later attachment by the Government.  The rivets for this attachment will be provided with the partially assembled panel.  Likewise, six (6) of the configuration #2 panels will be partially assembled in the same way.  The rivets are described in MIL-STD-20470, “Rivet, Solid, Universal Head, Aluminum and Aluminum alloy.  The 2017 Alloy is desired.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.    Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price which meets or exceeds the requirements in this document.

The Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) officially changed from an Operational Command to a Transformational Command of Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) on 19 June 2003. HQ SACT in Norfolk, VA, is seeking Contractor support for three projects to help complete the functional realignment of the two NATO Strategic Commands, establish effective output-based management processes, and deliver Transformation to the NATO Alliance.
	In Project One, a Command Structure Implementation (CIS) Team is being established to lead, advise, and oversee the restructuring and implementation processes that will result in full operational capability for Allied Command Transformation (ACT) by 30 June 2006. Team members will work with SACT Implementation Project Teams (IPT) on: evolving task development, identifying requirements for personnel positions, and conducting reviews and audits of Transformation activities. In turn, CSI Team members will convey information on IPT actions and activities to the HQ SACT Program Management Board where resource allocations are made.
Projects Two and Three address functional management/Balanced Scorecard and Information Management/Knowledge Management (IM/KM). These projects encompass on-going work and new requirements to ensure that functional management oversight is established to keep the Transformation maturing in ways that support the Alliance. The IM/KM project will support current ACT work in:
·	Strategic concepts, doctrine, and policy development
·	Concept development and experimentation
·	Requirements and capability planning and implementation
·	Joint education and training
·	Joint and combined future capabilities research and technology
The accompanying Statement of Work describes in detail the requirements of each of the three projects, functions to be performed, deliverables to be developed, positions sought, and requirements for candidate personnel.

<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-04-R-00012
<RESPDATE>011204
<CONTACT>Stephen  Bobby, 202-493-4786
<DESC>Interim Voice Switch Replacement Sources Sought The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a competitive contract for Telephony Voice Switching Systems to support the commissioning of new and refurbished Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities. We are conducting a market survey of industry sources who are interested participating in this procurement. Vendors must be capable of fulfilling the Interim Voice Switch Replacement (IVSR) program requirements. 1.1.	Operational Concept The Interim Voice Switch Replacement (IVSR) replaces obsolete electromechanical and aging analog voice switches in existing FAA facilities and will provide voice switching capabilities in new FAA facilities.  The IVSR will provide Air Traffic Controllers with reliable voice communication with aircraft, through radios or voice communication with other ground based air traffic facilities, through a telephone network.  The IVSR will allow the safe and efficient control of commercial and general aviation aircraft. The IVSR will be a software configurable voice switching system that is adaptable to the requirements of specific sites.  The IVSR system design will allow operators to communicate with each other and to interface with radios and telephone and inter phone voice paths. As ordered by the Government, the IVSR contractor will deliver, install, integrate, and test the IVSR at Government designated sites.  The IVSR contractor will provide the personnel, equipment, software, materials, and services required for these efforts.  The contractor will also provide system training and life-cycle support as designated by the Government. 1.2.	Sources Sought You are invited to submit a proposal demonstrating the suitability of your product to meet the critical criteria listed under section 1.3 and the requirements described in the draft SIR (enclosure 1).  The FAA will use the qualification/screening criteria outlined below to evaluate the responses to this announcement.  Only those offerors responding to this announcement and being evaluated as meeting the qualification/screening criteria will be determined to be eligible as a â€œqualified sourceâ€.   The Government will publish a list of the qualified sources approximately 20 days after responses are due.  Only the qualified sources will be eligible to respond to the final SIR. Issuance of the final SIR is anticipated in 2 February 2004. 1.3.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for Mobile Electric Power Distribution. The USMC is planning on fielding the replacement for its current Mobile Electric Power Distribution (MEPDIS) sets with a commercial based, tailorable system of power distribution panels that can be rapidly procured in support of military operations.  Current systems, although meeting the need, are heavy, expensive and have a long lead-time procurement cycle.  The USMC also intends to adopt commercial connectors for power lead interface, vice traditional military-style connectors. The future MEPDIS shall be capable of supplying 60Hz electrical power for lighting and power requirements, including lighting harnesses, when used with 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 100kW standard generator sets. Additionally, the system must be capable of distributing 120/208V power, Y-connected power.  The future MEPDIS is envisioned to consist of lightweight, modular, distribution panels NEMA 3R minimum, 4X desired.  The panels shall be in size configurations to handle 5, 15, 30 and 100 kW of electrical through-put, with the ability to be interconnected with lightweight, multi-conductor cables, with connectors sized by amperage, keyed for voltage and frequency, and capable of rapid connect/disconnect. Each panel will not exceed weight limits that would preclude being transportable by two men.  Wiring harnesses and cabling is envisioned as being initially fielded with the MEPDIS, but subsequent and rapid follow-on purchase of harnesses are envisioned by using units for equipment that is damaged, lost or consumed during military operations.  Through adaptors, the system shall be capable of interconnecting with other Services' electrical power distribution systems, utilizing only Military Standard Class-L electrical connectors, with a 3-phase, 5-wire (4-wire with equipment ground) capability. 

General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) may be an appropriate method for these supplies and services (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.0 and 8.4).

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for DC-AC power converters and for AC-AC frequency converters.  A lesson learned from recent military operations and an objective of the USMC is to field more DC-AC power inverters for on-vehicle applications.  A family of rugged power inverters in various power ranges is envisioned.  Capabilities in the 500 watt, 1000 watt, 2000 watt electrical output are solicited.  All systems shall interface to the vehicle’s DC system thru the NATO slave receptacle.  120 VAC, 60 Hz, true sine wave output is required, with circuit breaker protection of receptacles and input. The system shall be rugged and survivable in harsh USMC environments (cold, heat, dust, vibration, shock, moisture), as defined in Mil-Std 810 and Mil-Prf-28800.  The USMC currently has tactical generators that provide either 60 Hz or 400 Hz AC output.  To meet this need, the USMC fields a unique generator for each frequency.  As a fleet efficiency initiative to save on the number of unique generators that the USMC procures, operates, and must maintain, the USMC is investigating removing from service the 400 Hz generators and utilizing 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency converters for those unique pieces of equipment that still need 400 Hz input power. Capabilities for frequency conversion in the 10 kW, 30 kW, and 60 kW electrical input range are solicited.  All systems shall accept 120/208 VAC, 60 Hz, input, with 400 Hz output at less than 1.0 % variation in frequency (0.5% desired). The system shall be rugged and survivable in harsh USMC environments (cold, heat, dust, vibration, shock, moisture), as defined in Mil-Std 810 and Mil-Prf-28800.  

General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) may be an appropriate method for these supplies and services (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.0 and 8.4).

<RESPDATE>010904
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Heidi L Radaford, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7386
<DESC>1.0  Description 1.1  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is seeking sources for the potential development of Tools for Mobile Forces Chemical Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Modeling and Decision Support. 1.2  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes ? it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. 1.3 Interested parties are requested to provide a written response to this RFI.  Parties may include industry, government, and academic institutions. 2.0  Background 2.1  The Joint Operational Effects Federation (JOEF) is a program managed by the Joint Program Manager, Information Systems (JPM IS) within the Joint Program Executive Office (PEO) Chemical, Biological Defense (PEO-CBD).  The mission of JOEF is to support planning and decision?making for Chemical Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (CBRND).  For the purposes of this RFI, CBRND includes defenses against releases of toxic industrial materials (TIM).  JOEF will be used for strategic, operational, and tactical planning, course of action selection, and timely decision support in both deliberate and crisis planning situations.  It is to be compliant with Joint Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system standards, and hosted on Common Operating Environment (COE) C4I networked-systems (such as the Global Command and Control System, Joint), as well as non-COE C4I networked systems (such as Command and Control Personal Computer) and non-networked workstations. 3.0  Requirement 3.1  For respondents providing information regarding development of Tools for Mobile Forces for CBRND Modeling and Decision Support, we are soliciting information regarding either: 1.  Tools for mobile force CBRND analysis.  Simulations and other software products applicable to the quantification of CBRN impacts on mobile military forces and ?what if? analysis for the rapid development and evaluation of alternative courses of action in response to actual or hypothetical attacks. 2.  Decision support tools to assist users at fixed or mobile sites in identifying the appropriate plans, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for CBRND tasks and situations.  Also tools to guide users through the execution of chosen plans and TTPs to accomplish assigned tasks, respond to CBRN and TIM events, or manage event consequences. 3.2  The JPM IS is interested in determining what products meeting the above criteria exist in the marketplace.  This market-knowledge information will be used to help determine a strategy for a possible future acquisition.  Upon review of submissions, JPM IS expects to request additional descriptive information in the form of a questionnaire regarding those systems with potential applicability to JOEF.  Upon review of submissions, briefings and demonstrations may also be requested.  However, respondents to this announcement are NOT obligated to provide any additional information, briefings, or demonstrations.  Invited briefings or demonstrations may be scheduled as early as two to three weeks after white paper due date in locations designated by the program office in Washington, DC or San Diego, CA.  Demonstrations will be expected, at a minimum, to provide government evaluators with an opportunity to examine the proposed system and observe its application to mobile force CBRND analysis or decision support. 3.3  With respect to CBRND analysis, this announcement invites information regarding existing models, simulations, and other tools with the potential for representing CBRN and TIM effects and associated defensive actions of mobile forces operating throughout the battle space.  The tools should provide sufficient detail and flexibility to support the assessment of the workflows required to carry out these actions and operations.  The tools should support rapid estimation of operational mission impacts of CBRN and TIM releases, and the effectiveness of responsive courses of action in minimizing these impacts.  We are particularly interested in tools that are well documented and are currently used independently of the developer by commercial, government, or military customers. 3.4  With respect to decision support tools, this announcement invites information regarding existing software packages with the potential for use in JOEF for storing TTPs and planning documents, performing context-based searches to identify the appropriate TTPs and plans associated with user-specified tasks or operational events, and providing computer-based assistance in executing the plan or TTP. 4.0  White Paper Submissions 4.1  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a White paper no later than 09 January 2004, 3:00 p.m. PST. 4.2  White papers submissions shall be Microsoft Office 2000 compatible or Adobe PDF format.  Parties responding to this announcement shall provide the system?s name, owner, contact information, developer name, a brief description of the proposed candidate system including identification of any proprietary components, and a statement explaining why it is applicable to JOEF.  There is no limit on the number of candidate systems a party can propose; however, there is a ?one-page per system" limitation. 4.3  All interested parties shall submit their inputs to Heidi Radaford, Code 02-22P, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, Contract Office (4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127), via e-mail only at heidi.radaford@navy.mil.

<SOLNBR>W911SR-NECD-0001
<RESPDATE>021004
<ARCHDATE>04102004
<CONTACT>Nancy Kefauver, 410 436-4492
<DESC>NA The Army has a continued need for the operation and management of the Newport Chemical Depot (NECD) to provide care, maintenance, surveillance, security and collateral support services related to the demilitarization of chemical agent VX efforts at NECD.  The Government is currently interested in determining the interest and the capabilities of sources for this potential procurement.  Newport Chemical Depot (NECD) is a Government-owned Contractor-operated (GOCO) facility consisting of approximately 7,098 acres.  The depot is located within two miles of Newport, Indiana and approximately 70 miles west of Indianapolis, Indiana.  Though NE CD has been operating in a modified caretakerÃ¢Â€Â™s status since 1993, it was formerly a production facility for the chemical agent VX and the explosives, TNT and RDX.  Currently the depot is a stockpile storage site for bulk chemical agent VX.  The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency (CMA) is responsible for the management and operations of the depot.  The Depot Commander is an Army officer who is assisted by a Government staff.     The objective of the proposed acquisition is to obtain an on-site operating contractor for the period of 1 October 2004 through 30 September 2009 whose responsibility it will be to provide the depot with the everyday services which include but are not limi ted to: program management services for the Chemical Stockpile Storage Program (CSS), Chemical Treaty Compliance Program (CTC), Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), environmental management and compliance, natural and cultural resourc es, custodial services, trash removal, water treatment plant operation and distribution, maintenance of buildings and equipment, security, safety, grounds maintenance, and administrative support.  The contractor is further tasked to support the Environment al Restoration Program, the Project Manager for Elimination of Chemical Weapons (PM ECW) (formerly the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program (CSDP)) and the Non-Stockpile Materiel (NSCM) Program. The anticipated contract type is a 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Cost Reimbursement contract.  The current operating contract has an annual value of approximately $18 million.  Upon completion of the destruction of the stored chem ical agent VX in the 2004/2005 timeframe, the efforts for the NECD operating contract will be decreased significantly and it is anticipated the depot will begin preparation for closure.  Interested and qualified sources responding to this sources sought an nouncement are requested to provide a capability statement which summarizes the firms capabilities and qualifications to perform all the work contemplated.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted in response to the Sources Sought  request. 	Capability or Performance Ã¢Â€Â“ The operating contractor must have the key personnel and skilled labor, in its employment, with expertise in surety operations.  Although there is no requirement for a surety license or certification of corporations for th e operation of chemical storage, the operating contractor must pass the close scrutiny of the Department of the Army Inspector General during several on-site chemical surety inspections.   The operating contractor must provide the managerial skills necessa ry to support the following program/functional areas:  Chemical Stockpile Storage Program (CSS), Chemical Weapons Treaty Compliance Program (CTC), Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program (CSDP), Non-St ockpile Chemical Materiel Program (NSCM), services required to maintain the facilities, classified as modified caretaker, and related support activities include management of the agriculture and environmental programs. 	Interested parties are encouraged to submit their capability statements to Nancy Kefauver, Contract Specialist, at nancy.kefauver@us.army.mil by February 10, 2004.
