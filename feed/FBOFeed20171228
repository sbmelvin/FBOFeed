The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems.

Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training.
Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training.

The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.

Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.


The contractor will not be allotted any parking permits for onsite parking. On-site parking is very limited and not guaranteed by the VA.

The contractor shall request temporary construction badges from the COR. The superintendent shall issue these badges daily to each worker and record each badge number and employee in a daily log. These badges must be returned prior to project close-out. All contractors shall wear badges so that the badges are easily viewed at all times while on-site. Contractor shall notify the COR immediately of any lost badges.

The contractor shall provide all software, access keys or codes, or any external devices that may be required for the operation, calibration, or repair of the equipment purchased.

<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) is recruiting an individual on a competitive basis to serve as a Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS) Advisor under an intermittent personal services contract for its Economic Crimes Team (ECT).</p>
<p>The ECT operates through resident or intermittent engagements, assisting counterpart governments in the development and implementation of anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regimes. This work is premised on sound partnerships with host-country ministries of finance, justice, and interior; central banks and other financial regulatory bodies; and financial intelligence units. ECT technical assistance is aimed at developing the capacity in counterpart countries to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering, terrorist financing, and the related illicit activity.

<a href="mailto:kelly.m.nolan@navy.mil">kelly.m.nolan@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) intends to modify a Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) which is with Raytheon Company (94404) located in Portsmouth, RI.  The modification will add an additional configuration of the H-60 ST/R:
NSN 016590089, p/n H420805-2, Receiver-Transmitter

The additional item is projected for only the final and fifth year of the BOA for a total of $5 million.  

Raytheon is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 
https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. 


Responses to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this synopsis to NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia, Attn: Ms. Kelly Nolan, Contract Negotiator, Code (N732.21), 700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 1, Philadelphia, PA 19111.

The modification will be issued after the synopsis period closes.

<p>&bull; Process for establishing and maintaining effective means of communication with USACE project personnel on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Technical competence will be evaluated on the ability of the firm to manage, coordinate and work effectively with team members, both internal staff and subcontractors. General statements concerning resourcing and communications processes may be considered less favorably.</p>
<p>2. Professional qualifications:  Evaluation of professional qualifications will consider the qualifications of the firm and subcontractor's available personnel in key disciplines (see list of key personnel below). All personnel shall be shown on the organization chart in Section D of the SF 330. All resumes shall be provided in Section E of the SF 330. Resumes are required for each key personnel member.

<p>3.	Capacity (Section H):  A firm's capacity plan must demonstrate the ability to accomplish multiple task orders in multiple locations simultaneously, with the demonstrated ability to accomplish at least two (2) $5,000,000.00 individual task orders simultaneously.  For any one task order, the plan must demonstrate ability and capacity to provide approximately 40 personnel on site within 30 days of task order award, with at least half being key personnel of the type listed in Criteria 2, and maintain that level of personnel commitment over a one year period. The plan shall also describe the firm's present workload and the availability of the project team (key personnel and subcontractors) for the specified contract performance period; describe the strategies to meet surges in unexpected workload demand; ability to mobilize; and describe the ability of the firm to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services.

Secondary Selection Criteria shall consist of (IAW DFARS 236.602-1):<br /> <br />6.	Small Business (SB) and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation: [Defense PGI 236.602-1(a)(6)(C)].  The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  The greater the participation, the greater the consideration.</p>
<p>7.	Volume of DoD Contract Awards of A-E contracts received in the last 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms DFARS PGI 236.602-1(a)(6)(A).</p>

Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall be emailed to the following address: Robert.Jones8@fema.dhs.gov . In your email, please indicate your interest, business size, Cage Code, and DUNS Number. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. A site visit day will be held on January 11, 2018 at 10:00am CST.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources, industry best practices, and input specific to the information provided. The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.

All submissions will become Government property and will not be returned. Interested vendors are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.<br /><br />DETAILS: <br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is seeking a better understanding of the market capability to implement the engineering study recommendations of the joists in the mechanical rooms that need to be strengthened. New air handling units were installed in each of the mechanical rooms in 2016. The air handling units were constructed on 6-inch concrete pads. The air handling units in Mechanical Rooms 1 and 2 was installed in 2016. The two units appear to have been installed on a 6-inch thick concrete equipment pad. The weights of the units were obtained from the manufacturer as 5,790 lbs. for AHU-1 and 4,660 lbs. for AHU-2. These gross weights relate to a uniform live load of 65 psf and 55 psf respectively. Using these loads, the momentum capacities of the joists in Mechanical Room 1 were exceeded by 28% and by 13% in Mechanical Room 2. Based upon this, and an engineering study recommendation the joists in the mechanical rooms need to be strengthened. Although the allowable published capacities of the joists are exceeded, these capacities are based upon utilizing approximately 60% of the yield strength of the steel. This allows some factor of safety against failure. While the joists are not believed to be in eminent danger of failure, steps should be taken as soon as possible to strengthen the joists. Repair the mechanical room floors to ensure adequate strength has been added to ensure a safe dead load for the mechanical rooms.</p>
<p>Services Needed:<br />1.Remove the ceiling and furring channels from the first-floor ceiling.<br />2.Consider the existing infrastructure attached to the ceiling of the first-floor ceiling.<br />3.Provide temporary jack supports to relieve a portion of the existing load from the joists.<br />4.Weld strengthening elements to the top and bottom chords.<br />5.Weld strengthening elements to the joist webs.<br />6.Remove temporary supports.<br />7.Replace furring system and ceiling.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B117, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640<br /><br /><br />Background:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a continuously tunable laser and wavelength meter for use in quantum optomechanics and optomechanical sensor projects. The tunable, narrow linewidth laser will be used to probe a variety of quantum optics and quantum cavity optomechanics experiments, as well as to probe silicon nanophotonic sensors. The wavelength meter will be used to determine and set the laser wavelength.
<p><br />After market research results are obtained and analyzed, minimum requirements specifications for a continuously tunable laser and wavelength meter will be established. NIST may use these established specifications in conducting a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order in the future. If a minimum of two (2) qualified small businesses are identified during market research stage, then any resulting competitive procurement may be considered for a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><br />Requirements:<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources with 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.<br /><br />Through this notice, NIST is also seeking market information to determine whether to conduct a single competitive procurement for both the continuously tunable laser and wavelength meter or to solicit them as two separate compatible procurements. As a result, even if only able to offer one of the two required products, responsible sources are still encouraged to respond by the notice due date with the requested information.</p>

It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE</strong>:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 326199 - ALL OTHER PLASTICS PRODUCT MANUFACTURING.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 750 or fewer employees.</p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong>:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br /> <br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the cause, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Need and Purpose</strong>: The purpose of this acquisition is to aquire two (2) sizes of polycarbonate tunnels that are tailored to research protocol specifications for the NINDS rodent colonies housed in NIH Buildings 35, and 10 ACRF. Product quality, particularly size, color, and material, are considered imperative.  Anticipated contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity-type contract with a 12-month (one year) base ordering period and four successive 12-month (one year) term option ordering periods (total possible ordering period of 5 years).</p>
<p><strong>Background Information and Objective</strong>: The Animal Health Care Section (AHCS) of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is tasked with veterinary care, management and oversight responsibilities for rodent colonies in the NIH Building 35 Shared Animal Facility.  Rodents housed in this vivarium are utilized in animal study protocols belonging to eight (8) NIH Institutes and Centers. Two sizes of polycarbonate tunnels (one sized for mice and one sized for rats) are required fixtures within the cage habitat.  These tunnels will assist in maintaining consistent health, welfare and environmental enrichment for the mice and rats that are utilized in numerous animal study protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Generic Name of Product</strong>:  Polycarbonate enrichment tunnels for small animals (mouse and rat)</p>
<p><strong>Salient characteristics</strong><br />Contractor shall provide two sizes of polycarbonate tunnels for the NINDS AHCS rodent colonies enrichment as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;	Mouse tunnels shall be extruded and cut to the following dimensions:<br />Length:  4.00"<br />Inside Diameter:  1-9/16" (1.5625")<br />Outside Diameter:  1-13/16" (1.8125")<br />Wall Thickness:  0.125"<br />&bull;	Rat tunnels shall be extruded and cut to the following dimensions:<br />Length:  6.00"<br />Inside Diameter:  3.00"<br />Outside Diameter:  3-1/4" (3.25")<br />Wall Thickness:  0.125"<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be manufactured (extruded) from virgin, high-temperature polycarbonate.<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be manufactured with an amber tint.  The amber tint shall be light enough to permit visualization of the animals within the tubes without having to open the cage, but be dark enough that the animals perceive the space within the tube to be slightly dimmer than the surrounding cage. <br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be transparent so that rodents residing inside the tunnels are visible during observation periods.<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be manufactured with minimal surface ridges in order to reduce light distortion<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall not visually distort size or image of observed rodents nesting inside the tunnels.<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be smooth-cut to length and shall be cut square with the length<br />&bull;	Tunnels shall be manufactured so that there are no cracks, crevices, or sharp edges. <br />&bull;	Tunnels must be odorless, and nonhazardous to humans and rodents<br />&bull;	[insert any additional details you can think of, if any, that you will be looking for when examining supplied samples; the more detail, the more items we can "point to" to support our award decision - we can only base our award decision on the written evaluation criteria (if we base our award decision on anything other than what is written, a losing offeror could potentially "protest" and overturn our award decision, so the more detail we provide, the better)].</p>
<p><strong>Quantity:</strong> <br />The maximum quantity that the government may order in the base year of the contract is detailed in the table below. The minimum quantity which may be ordered for the base year of the contract is detailed in the same table.  In option years 1 through 4, 25% of these numbers may be ordered.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2018 to January 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG09 and must be located within Region 9.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p>In accordance with DoD 6025.18-R "Department of Defense Health Information Privacy Regulation," January 24, 2003, the Contractor meets the definition of Business Associate. Therefore, a Business Associate Agreement is required to comply with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security regulations.

<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com. <br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care. <br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>
<p><br />BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)</p>
<p>Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.

Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.

It was also determined that the Scope of Work needs to be more clearly defined.

A new solicitation for services is expected to be posted on FBO in January 2018.

<p>C-1 DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>The Standfordville East Timber Sale is planned to be implemented as an Integrated Resource Timber Contract with embedded service work projects. This cruise plan includes an estimated 467 +/- acres of thinning intended to move project area stands from their current overstocked condition towards the desired condition for RCW habitat. Individual cut tree marking (CTM) is planned for 415 +/- acres in eight (8) units. These areas will receive a 100% tally with sample trees using the Sample Tree (STR) cruise method. Individual leave tree marking (LTM) is planned for 52 +/- acres in two (2) units and will be prism cruised and sampled using the point count measure (PCM) cruise method.</p>
<p>The Contractor's personnel assigned cruising duties shall be qualified cruisers meeting Region 8 Forest Service standards. This qualification process generally takes two days. One day to work through a self-study guide followed by a written test and one day to field measure a set of trees and then to compare them against predetermined measurements for those same trees.</p>
<p>If Contractor's personnel have been previously certified as Region 8 Forest Service Qualified Cruisers, such documentation must be provided to the Forest Service. In such cases, individuals will only need to complete the field measurements test prior to starting work.</p>
<p>C-2 PROJECT LOCATION</p>
<p>The Project is located in Compartments 142, 144 and 145 of the Oconee Ranger District, 7+/- miles from Eatonton, in Putnam County, Georgia. Unit boundaries have been mapped and designated. All Unit boundaries are painted with orange paint (three stripes on perimeter trees)</p>
<p>The slopes in the cutting units range from gentle to moderately steep, 0 to 30%. Access to the area is excellent.</p>

<p><br /><strong>RFQ SUBMISSION</strong></p>
<p>This announcement will close at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>1)	Inquiries - Inquiries and all correspondence concerning this solicitation document should be submitted in writing to James Rall, at james.rall@noaa.gov, and Andrew Hildebrandt, at andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov, by 2:00 EST on January 10, 2017.  The Government is not required to provide responses to vendor's inquiries or correspondence.</p>
<p>2)	Quotation Preparation</p>
<p>The following instructions apply for the submission of quotes:</p>
<p>a.	Quotes shall be submitted in three (3) separate volumes:<br /> <br /> Volume I - Past Performance <br /> Volume II - Technical<br /> Volume III - Price</p>
<p>b.	The technical volume shall NOT contain any reference to price.  It is incumbent upon the Quoter to provide a technical volume in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that includes, but is not limited to, the technical requirements of the RFQ.</p>
<p>c.	The Government will evaluate quotes in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2 of this RFQ.</p>
<p>3)	<strong>Quote Instructions</strong></p>
<p>a.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance</span>:<br />Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Quoter to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation.  Quoters are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) for like or similar work. Quoters may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Each Quoter shall submit, in writing, information on past performance (<strong>10 page limit</strong>). Quoters shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating recapitalization experience with NOAA or demonstrated equivalent experience with recapitalization efforts relevant to the requirements of the solicitation.  In addition, the Quoter is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the Quoter in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires to the following:</p>
<p>James Rall<br /> james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov) <br /> U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/ERAD</p>
<p>The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the Quoter.  Only Questionnaires submitted on time and from the Quoter's references will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the Quoter as it relates to the Quoter's demonstrated past performance with recapitalization efforts and the probability of the Quoter to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.</p>
<p>Quoters are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The burden of providing thorough, complete, and demonstrated relevant past performance information with recapitalization efforts rests with the Quoter.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is "late" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the Quoter possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.</p>
<p>Quotes lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government when compared to the submissions of other Quoters having a satisfactory (or better) past performance.</p>
<p>b.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical</span>: Each Quoter shall submit a technical submission (<strong>10 page limit</strong>). The technical submission should be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete so as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the Quoter has a thorough understanding of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Quotes which merely state that requirements are understood and will be complied with, which paraphrase the specification document, the SOW or parts thereof, or use phrases such as "standard consulting practices will be employed", or "well established techniques will be employed", etc., may be considered unacceptable.  The technical submission shall include the Management Approach.  This may be expressed as the Quoter's proposed approach or methodology to performing the work required in the RFQ.  This criterion measures how well the Quoter's plan presents an efficient and realistic approach to fulfilling the solicitation's requirements.  It also measures how likely the Quoter's suggested organization and management will be successful in performing the work.</p>
<p>c.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price</span>: The Quoter shall submit all information required for the line items included within this solicitation.  The quoted prices for the line items will be added together and used for evaluation purposes to determine the best value to the government over the base year, inclusive with each subsequent option year, over the life of the contract. The quoted prices will also be used to determine reasonableness.<br /> <br /><br />52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 2017)<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Past Performance <br />&bull;	Technical</p>
<p>Past Performance is the most important factor.  Past Performance and Technical, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding purchase order without further action by either party.  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>
<p>(b) Change Request Process will occur in the following order:</p>
<p>1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COR . <br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Change Request- CR and IGE are generated by the COR and entered in the Contract Workbook. COR will assign the Change request number.<br />4. COR provides copy of Change Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on CR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Change Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO</p>
<p>Change Request must be submitted by the COR to the contractor within 24 hours after responding to the CFR. Contractor must submit proposal to the Contracting Officer within 72 hours receipt of the Change Request.</p>
<p>A modification will be issued to incorporate and implement all changes made by change orders.</p>
<p>9. CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COR.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

The U.S. Government has re-evaluated its delivery requirements, and the following applies to this acquisition:
Acronyms:
VA   The Department of Veterans Affairs
VA POC   The Department of Veterans Affairs Point of Contact
The following is added to the price cost schedule of supplies and services:
Due to a shortage of available storage at the VA facility, shipment shall be in three shipments. The first shipment shall include thirty-four (34) single monitor sit-stand desktops and sixty-six (66) dual monitor sit-stand desktops. The second shipment shall include thirty-four (34) single monitor sit-stand desktops and sixty-six (66) dual monitor sit-stand desktops. The third shipment shall include thirty-two (32) single monitor sit-stand desktops and sixty-eight (68) dual monitor sit-stand desktops. The first shipment shall be shipped immediately following award of the contemplated contract. The contractor shall be notified by the VA POC when the first shipment of one hundred (100) sit-stand desktops is nearly installed so that the next order of one hundred (100) sit-stand desktops can be shipped, and the same applies to the final shipment of one hundred (100) sit-stand desktops. The name and contact information for the VA POC will be included in the contemplated contract. 
The period of performance shall be the effective date of the award through such time as all items have been delivered.
The following FAR clauses have been added and apply to this solicitation:
52.216-18  Ordering (Oct 1995)
(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from the effective date of the award through the end of the contract period.
(b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.
(c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered  issued  when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.
(End of Clause)
52.216-19  Order Limitations (Oct 1995)
(a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $25.00, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract.
(b) Maximum order. The Contractor is not obligated to honor --
(1) Any order for a single item in excess of $700.00;
(2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of $200,000.00; or
(3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 2 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 2 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor s intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source.
(End of Clause)
52.216-20  Definite Quantity (Oct 1995)
(a) This is a definite-quantity, indefinite-delivery contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule.
(b) The Government shall order the quantity of supplies or services specified in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall furnish them when ordered. Delivery or performance shall be at locations designated in orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause and the Schedule.
(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.
(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that time shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor s and Government s rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract s effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after all of the sit-stand desktops listed in the Schedule have been delivered.

It is the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs that some items, such as purses, be locked up while at the facility. The grommet is in the back corner of the desk, under the storage bins.  
Because space is limited, and the locked storage bins need to stay in place, and the grommet is in the back corner of the desk, the sit-stand desktops must fit under the locked storage bins when in the sitting position, and must be able to be extended out past the locked storage bins and up for the standing position. The distance between the top of the desks and the bottom of the locked storage bins is 19 ¾ inches in height. The depth from the desk grommet to the outer edge of the locked storage bin is 14 inches. 
The monitor towers must be able to swivel so that the monitors can be positioned as needed by the user to accommodate the optimal and most comfortable viewing of the monitors by the user. 
The ability to adjust the height, tilt, and rotation is needed so that the sit-stand desk units may be pulled out and up from the corner of the desk where the grommet is located and adjusted according to the optimal and most comfortable viewing angle of the user. 
Sit-stand desktops must incorporate a hydraulic, gas, or some other mechanical method to assist with lifting and lowering the sit-stand desk to reduce chances of physical strain and for the comfort of the user.

<DESC>About the Incumbent and Current Contract: <br /><br />The current contract, awarded to U.S. Bank, will expired on 03/27/2018. To ensure no lapse in service between the end of the current contract and the award of the new contract, ICE intends to issue a sole source contract to the incumbent contractor.<br /><br />
<p>Limitation on Pricing Approaches and Models: <br /><br />Note that at this time ICE cannot accept any pricing model (such as a no-cost or transaction-based approach) that increases the application fee for the SEVP participant. The SEVP student/visitor fee is set by statute and cannot be changed at this time. Therefore Offerors shall conform the price proposal to the tasks outlined in the PWS. Although ICE is exploring the option of converting the I-901 system to a transaction fee, no cost contract approach in the future, the Offeror's ability to provide such a solution will not be considered at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Description of Requirement<br /></strong><br />(1)	The U.S. Department of Commerce, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boulder, CO conducts an upper air observation program at the Weather Service Contract Meteorological Observatory (WSCMO) at the Denver International Airport in Denver, CO, which meets a variety of needs and serves a variety of users.  Upper air observations are taken and coded for the operational use of meteorologists and hydrologists, as well as for international dissemination.<br /><br />(2)	The contractor shall furnish all supervision and labor to take, document, and disseminate upper air observations using the Radiosonde Replacement System (RRS) workstation in Denver, CO. All observers shall be RRS certified by the NWS and be able to maintain certification during the contract period of performance. <br /><br />(3)	All services conducted in connection with the performance of the contract shall be in accordance with the most recent revision(s) of upper air observing manuals and guidelines used by the NWS. National Weather Service Manual 10-1401available at the following link: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01014001curr.pdf<br /><br />(4)	Observations shall be taken two times daily, each and every day of the contract period.   Observations shall have a standard scheduled release time of 0000 and 1200 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Required upper air data shall be transmitted to National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) at the prescribed times for all scheduled releases. <br /> <br />(5)	Normally, the completion of one upper air observation using the RRS requires the attention of one observer for a minimum of 3.25 hours.  The Contractor shall have an RRS certified observer on duty at the WSCMO from 1015 to 1330 UTC and 2215 to 0130 UTC each day of the contract period.  Additional time may be required when second releases are needed or if other problems arise.  On average, there are 6 second releases annually.<br /><br />(6)	Observation balloons to be used in the taking of the RRS observation shall be inflated with hydrogen or helium gas, at the discretion of the government. The hydrogen and/or helium gases are bottled, and shall be furnished by the Government. All operating instructions and applicable safety equipment shall be supplied by the Government. The Contractor shall take all necessary precautions to ensure that appropriate safety measures are followed when working with hydrogen and/or helium gas.<br /><br />(7)	Special RRS observations are deemed as those observations  which  are  requested  by  the  NWS,  in  addition to  those  specified  above. The Contractor shall be required to take, record, and document a special RRS observation associated with NWS sanctioned field projects or critical meteorological events. Normally, the RRS observation requires the attention of one RRS certified observer for a minimum of three (3) hours for a special observation. Special launches will be ordered as needed.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a.	Whenever possible, the NWS shall provide notification of at least twelve (12) hours before a special RRS observation is required. However, during a weather emergency, this 12 hour advance notice may not be possible. The Contractor shall make every effort to take the requested observation during weather emergencies with a shorter advance notification time.  Typically this shorter advanced notification time will be no less than six (6) hours.  Special observations may require special dissemination and/or handling procedures such as terminating the flight at a lower burst altitude than normally obtained.<br /><br />(8)	The Government shall determine and furnish all forms, charts, and local and national expendable supplies necessary for the Contractor to carry out the requirements of this contract. Local expendable supplies include pens and pencils, paper, forms, CDs, hydrogen, etc. Government provided expendable supplies include RRS instruments, batteries, lighting units, train regulators, parachutes, twine, and balloons.<br /><br />(9)	The Government shall furnish those portions of the handbooks and manuals which provide the regulatory material regarding meteorological observations which the Contractor is required to comply in the performance of this contract. These manuals include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Radiosonde Replacement System Workstation User Guide<br />National Weather Service NWSPD 10-1401<br />Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3 (FMH) Engineering Handbooks Numbers 8, 9 and 15 (EHB)</p>
<p>(10) All Contractor personnel who are assigned the duties of taking observations shall be certified upper air observers utilizing the RRS system.

The Contractor's Site Supervisor certification must be verified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Contractor personnel must demonstrate proficiency in all facets of the upper air program. RRS observer and Site Supervisor certificates with the required endorsement(s) will be displayed in plain sight or available for review as necessary. Certifications shall remain current, without lapse, during the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>Uncertified Contractor personnel may watch observations in a training capacity only if supervised by the Contractor's Site Supervisor, upon advance notification to the COR.</p>
<p>(11)	 The upper air observation system utilizes the RRS computer workstation and requires a minimum of 3.25 hours to complete the observation from release to burst, performed by a NWS approved RRS certified observer. Additional time may be necessary to quality control data, complete required reports and perform other upper air observation related tasks.  Much of the operator's time is spent responding to the RRS workstation prompts, data evaluation and quality control.</p>
<p>(12)	 Contractor shall perform all services diligently and in a good, professional and first class manner, using good quality materials, equipment and workmanship and sufficiently trained personnel (including supervisors when appropriate) to complete the services in a safe and timely manner which does not unduly interfere with the operation of the WSCMO, or the business therein.

confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.

The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>

Digital Sciences' price submission was not only lower than the IGCE and all other prices but they were rated technically acceptable with 1 strength. In comparison to other prices and solutions, it would be of no benefit for the Government to accept any higher priced quote that is not technically acceptable or higher.</p>
