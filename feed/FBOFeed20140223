<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS BEING ISSUED FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED BY INTERESTED PARTIES RESPONDING TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE PREPARATION OF ANY INFORMATION PRESENTED OR THE USE OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION. THE INTENT OF THIS NOTICE IS TO IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESS (SB) CONCERNS, CERTIFIED 8(A), HUBZONE, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES (SDVOSB), AND WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (WOSB) CONCERNS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW. <br>  <br> The Joint Project Manager - Protection (JPM-P) of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) is seeking sources that are capable of providing contamination indication/decontamination assurance technology and applicator(s) for visually indicating traditional nerve and blister chemical warfare agents and non-traditional agents on tactical vehicles, aircraft, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons, and individual/personnel weapons that may have been exposed to chemical contamination in hostile and non-hostile environments. <br>  <br> The CIDAS will be used by personnel in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) level 4 to assist in immediate, operational, or thorough decontamination of military equipment to reduce the hazard to personnel and equipment and to assist in restoration of operational mission capability.  Anticipated CIDAS requirements include two configurations of applicator: a small scale weighing less than 12 pounds, and a mid scale weighing less than 24 pounds.  The applicators should apply the indicator to a surface, such as a HMMWV, to indicate the presence and location of contamination within five minutes. <br>  <br> The goal of CIDAS is to provide the Warfighter a capability that not only indicates trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations. This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated. This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating  quote mark hot spots quote mark  from  quote mark clean spots quote mark  on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful. Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, DED personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency. The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicator. <br>  <br>  <br> REQUESTED INFORMATION <br>  <br> Interested parties responding to this request are asked to submit the following information, as applicable and available: <br>  <br> 1. A positive statement of interest to submit a proposal as a contractor on a possible future solicitation for this system;    <br>  <br> 2.

Performance in presence of field grime such as mud, blood, decontaminants, petroleum, oils and lubricants <br> c. Concept of employment, e.g., visibility during daytime and night time operations by the human eye or with the aid of a supporting technology which should be identified <br> d.
