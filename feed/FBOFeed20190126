Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010]<BR><BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<BR><BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Regina Lawrence Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 240-3197 Email: regina.d.lawrence.mil@mail.mil<BR><BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required.

At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas.
