<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment
(CSAT), through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM),
Program Support Center(PSC), is planning to award a 12 month
contract using simplified acquisition procedures, to the
National Quality Forum, 601 13th Street, NW, Suite 500 North
Washington, DC 20005.  The anticipated date of award is September
15, 2005.

The objective of this request is to submit the Washington Circle
(WC) administrative process performance measures to the National
Quality Forum (NQF) national standard-setting consensus process
in order to have them accepted as a national standardized
measurement for quality improvement.  The WC measures were
already accepted into the NCQA HEDIS© data set, a standard
quality improvement tool employed by the majority of  managed
care companies serving the US population.  Inclusion of the
Washington Circle measures into the NQF ambulatory care
performance measurement set will expand the reach of the
measures to other non-managed care companies, health systems
and quality standard organizations, professional associations,
trade associations, regional county and state quality
improvement organizations, universities hospitals, large
and small health insurers and other core institutions that
comprise the United States health care system.  Failure to
expand the approval of these measures through this process
will result in duplicative and costly efforts by other public
and private organizations to develop and maintain process
performance measures for substance abuse.

The Contactor shall meet with the government project officer and other CSAT staff and WC members to determine the process for expedited review and implementation of the Washington Circle administrative measures for incorporation into the NQF ambulatory care standardized measure set.
    
Based on the results of Task 1, the Contractor shall establish a work plan describing specific steps, actions, processes and timeline required to achieve the expedited review and implementation of the measures.

The Contractor shall prepare monthly reports on the status of the work plan tasks and deadlines, for 10 months not including the first or last months.

The Contactor shall prepare a final summary of the project.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under Authority of Far 5.201(b)(1).  In accordance with FAR
19.502-2(a), the contracting officer has determined that there
is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or
more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in
terms of market price, quality and delivery; Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03,
Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on

<DESC>The Great Basin Institute is a non-profit organization and part of the University of Nevada, Reno.  The Institute oversees the Nevada Conservation Corps (NCC), a federally funded environmental science and career program which harnesses the idealism and energy of young people to meet the needs of communities and state and federal agencies administering the vast public lands in Nevada.  The goal of NCC is to promote a model for environmental studies and service, while providing direct conservation initiatives for regional public lands in Nevada. NCC provides employees, including laborers and research assistants for projects on state, federal and local lands.  Desert National Wildlife Refuge and Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge needs to hire both crews, and a federal agency liaison to complete major habitat restoration projects on each refuge.  These efforts are funded through a Conservation Initiative under the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998. The cost of NCC employees and work crews is far less than the cost of a temporary employee, or that of a private contractor.  NCC  is also able to recruit and schedule crews in a short time frame, which is essential to collect mature seeds for grow-out, stabilize restoration projects following heavy equipment use, and plant native vegetation.   Estimated Award Date 9/6/2005.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration & Customs Enforcement intends to negotiate a four-month extension for the period of November 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006, with two one month options with the incumbent contractor, The Geo Group, to manage and operate the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located at United States Naval Air Station (USNAS) Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba.  The NAICS Code is 561612 and the Size Standard is $10.5 million. The Geo Group, Inc. is presently providing services for all operational aspects of the MOC related to safety, security and accountability of the migrant population. Services provided include operation and management of the migrant population according to security and other classification considerations: intake/release procedures; maintenance of a perpetually current electronic population roster, housing and job assignments; accountability through direct observation, physical counts, development and enforcement of migrant rules and responsibilities; control of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) secure perimeter; transportation of migrants in contractor owned vehicles to programs and service on GTMO; and facilitating the delivery of programs and services by government organizations or representatives.  The performance location is one of the most secure and remote military bases in the world. Employee recruitment is difficult due to isolation of the performance location and potential separation from family. The four-month extension with additional one-month option periods is required to award a new contract with an anticipated start date of April 1, 2006. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions pertaining to the publication shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to Linda.Holder@dhs.gov or FAX to 949-360-3013.

<DESC>FUNDS ARE NOT PRESENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT; NO AWARD WILL BE MADE UNDER THIS SOLICITATION UNTIL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.  The purpose of the acquisition will be for the award of contracts to multiple offerors for Tower Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract (MAC) at CEU Oakland, CA 94606.  The Tower IDIQ-MAC is for execution of Tower Inspections and Maintenance at Various U.S. Coast Guard Facilities Nationwide including Hawaii and Alaska. We anticipate awarding five (5) IDIQ contracts to a minimum of five (5) contractors.  A seed project titled: FY05 Loran Tower Inspection and Maintenance at Various Coast Guard Sites in CA, MT, NV, and WA will be the basis for evaluation and will be simultaneously awarded via delivery order (DO) to the contractor receiving the best overall rating with respect to solicitation criteria.  Work to be performed under the Tower IDIQ-MAC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237130 - Power and Communication Line and Related Structures.  Size standard is $28.5 million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual tasks, including tower and antenna maintenance, repairs, installations and demolitions.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual delivery order.  Individual delivery orders may range between estimated $2,000- $2M.  The program value is Not-to-Exceed $5 million per year over a five-year period.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the “Best Value” source selection procedures described in Section 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and applicable to Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard statutes, regulations, and rules.  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award those offerors who give the Coast Guard the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process by its nature is subjective.  This may result in the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.  The RFP’s seed project will be awarded to the best value offeror for the first award.  A pre-proposal meeting at Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is planned.  More definite information concerning the meeting (date/time/points of contact) will be included in the solicitation.  The estimated cost of this procurement; FY05 LORAN TOWER INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE AT VARIOUS COAST GUARD SITES IN CA, MT, NV, & WA (seed project); is between $250,000 and $500,000.  Performance period is 180 calendar days after receipt of delivery order (DO).  This project is 100% Small Business Set-aside.  All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal.  This seed project will be the basis for evaluation and will be simultaneously awarded via delivery order (DO) to the contractor receiving the best overall rating with respect to solicitation criteria.    All other successful awardees will be guaranteed a minimum payment over the term of the contract; dollar amount and restrictions will be stated in the solicitation.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  Offerors are encouraged to scrutinize the solicitation carefully when posted for more information.  TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.   The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on approximately September 15, 2005.  If it does not appear on that date, please check back daily.   Offerors should register to receive notification of this solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Nautronix Maripro, Inc. of Goleta, CA for procurement of  Hydro Acoustic Information Link (HAIL) acoustic communications support to Naval Special Warfare Craft.  The HAIL system is an acoustic approach for undersea communications provided by Nautronix PLC (the Australian parent company of Nautronix Maripro Inc).  HAIL has been fielded by the Royal Australian Navy in Collins-class submarines and is undergoing foreign comparative testing in US Submarines.  Recent events accelerated interest within Naval Special Warfare for potential HAIL communications between US submarines and Special Operations Forces.   Therefore, NSWC PC has been asked to coordinate HAIL-related RDT&E efforts for certain Naval Special Warfare craft.  This effort will require contracted assistance from activities possessing detailed knowledge of the HAIL ! system.  The anticipated support  is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Nautronix, PLC and their US subsidiary, Nautronix Maripro Inc., possess unique and proprietary knowledge of the HAIL system.  Nautronix is also the sole contractual source for information regarding interface with US Navy submarines under foreign comparative testing.  Therefore, Nautronix is the only company capable of supporting integration of HAIL software and hardware for Naval Special Warfare craft.  Given these facts, Nautronix is uniquely qualified to provide the required communication system. The anticipated award date will be on or about June 30, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Period of performance will be 90 days from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 541511.  Size Standard is $21M.  FSC 6320.

This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The software being acquired is currently being used to conduct Structural and FEA for systems being integrated into the Littoral Combat Ship.   To accurately correlate and validate equipment models prior to installation is critical to the smooth design and integration of systems into the LCS.  It is critical that all software is consistent throughout the design and integration process.  Use of another software to conduct the structural and Finite Element Analysis may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable errors into the systems being integrated into the LCS.   Failure to have accurate models could result in significant damage to the integrated systems and possibly the LCS.  It is impera! tive that FEA software is acquired from Algor immediately.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City intends to award a sole source  purchase order to Rotomotion, LLC of 501-C La Mesa St., Mt. Pleasant, SC 29464 for the development of a Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) compliant network layer which will reside on a Flight controller box with an option for puchasing a Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for testing with the flight controller.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  this effort is a follow-on to the JAUS and NATO Cross Talk (JNXT) experiment utilizing a Rotomotion hobbiest model vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV.  Due to the extreme similarities of this new project and the JNXT it is essential to have hardware and software that is 100% compatible to allow for comparison of previous results to the data to be collected. This requires using Rotomotion’s remote and autonomus controlled helicopters, flight control syst! em and platform control code.   Only Rotomotion, LLC has the initmate knowledge of their flight controller and UAV vehicles that  will significantly reduce the time for software code integration. Use of any other vendor would result in a substantial duplication of cost and would negatively impact the project schedule.  NAICS:  541511.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding: microRNA expression profiling of human hepatocellular carcinoma with the Ohio State University Research Foundation, M376 Starling Loving 320 W 10T, Columbus, Ohio 43210.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the business size standard is $6M. 

Recent studies have indicated that the microRNA expression profiles are very informative in reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumors and are superior in classifying tumors as compared to cDNA expression profiles.  The laboratory has previously collected a cohort of 300 hepatocellular carcinoma clinical specimens and 300 surrounding non-cancerous liver tissues. This cohort has extensive clinical data including, tumor staging, liver functions, viral status, pre- and post-operative treatments, the status of metastasis, follow up and survival status, etc. It is an excellent cohort to dissect and identify potential diagnostic and prognostic signatures for liver cancer. NCI has completed the cDNA expression profiles of these samples.  Dr. Carlo Croce at Ohio State University is collaborating with the NCI with similar services in conjunction to perform the microRNA expression profiles of these samples using their second generation of microRNA arrays. The proposed collaboration project is essential to provide consistency of expression profiles in microRNA from different types of human cancers, which will undoubtedly allow us to make the best comparison to determine specific and common changes important in human neoplasms. 

Dr. Croce at the Ohio State University is the only source known to the NCI that is a pioneer and worldwide expert in this new area of cancer research.  He has developed a unique platform for the quantitative analysis of microRNAs.  He will utilize the novel, customized microRNA array facility at Ohio State University in order to perform expression profiling of microRNA expression profiling of human hepatocellular carcinoma.  The initial results of this ongoing study indicate the potential to identify cancer at an early, more treatable stage and to predict prognosis.  Therefore, it is imperative that these investigations are continued without interruption and further validated in a large patient population.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 9, 2005.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment 02 to the Sources Sought Notice for Solicitation Number HSFEHQ-05-R-0035 is being issued to replace the entire Description content of the original Synopsis, including Selection Criteria and General Instructions, to reflect the changes made to the text in Amendment 01 and in this Amendment, most notably the addition of 2 evaluation factors to the Selection Criteria. This Amendment 02 also includes 2 attachments that will be uploaded: 1) QUESTIONS/ANSWERS TO SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, and 2) LIST OF INCUMBENT TAC CONTRACTORS.
 
The new Synopsis Description is as follows:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award up to four (4), Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Task Order contracts starting in fiscal year 2006, subject to the availability of funds. Each basic IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five years. 

The contracts awarded under this solicitation will be performance-based, utilizing the performance metrics. The metrics in Factor 6 are for evaluation purposes and will be subject to negotiation if a firm is selected for contract negotiations. 

The basic IDIQ contract will be structured to allow for the issuance of Time and Materials (T&M) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders. The estimated cost for all services is $150 million per five-year contract if four contracts are awarded, and $200 million per contract if three contracts are awarded. The minimum guaranteed amount for each contract will be $100,000.00.

This procurement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System code of 541330 (Engineering Services) with a size standard of $4.0 million. 

The selected firms will be required to provide technical assistance services, such as technical support and project management disaster-related operations under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206 (hereinafter referred to as the Stafford Act).  The program activities of the Stafford Act are highly visible and require coordination with Federal, State, and local governments and/or volunteer organizations.  The selected firms shall be required to provide the necessary resources to adequately support disaster operations throughout FEMA Regions I through X.  The Contractor shall have personnel on-site at the disaster office within 48 hours of tasking notification. Due to the nature of FEMA’s work, the Contractor must be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The selected firms will be required to provide technical expertise to perform the services set forth in the attached Draft Scope of Work. 

Selection Criteria

The selection process will be in conformance with the provisions of Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Architect-Engineer Act. The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase, during which the SF 330 will be used to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

Due diligence will be held after the short-listed firms are so notified. The short-listed firms will be given the opportunity to schedule one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff as the firms are preparing their submissions for Phase 2.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these discussions will be conducted in Washington, D.C. and should not take longer than two (2) hours. Short-listed firms can make an appointment for the due diligence meetings by telephoning Gary Fontaine at (202) 646-3356.

Phase 2: Selection Phase, during which the slated firms (selected during the Screening Phase) will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations pursuant to FAR 36.602-3(c). The oral presentation and discussions are to be conducted by the firm’s proposed management team. The additional information will consist of a comprehensive Project Management Plan (PMP), and a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). The package shall not exceed seventy-five (75) pages. The plans will be reviewed before oral presentations. The short-listed firms may be requested during discussions to provide further clarification concerning their submissions. After oral presentations, the firms will be re-evaluated, re-rated and re-ranked. (NOTE: In accordance with Scope of Work Paragraph 1.4.2 Open Action Report, the highest technically rated firm selected for award will be the Lead for maintenance of the real-time Web reporting site for the program).

The Selection Criteria listed below will be used for rating and ranking. Firms selected for consideration of an IDIQ contract will be notified. Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection, and will proceed until an award or awards are made. 

Seven (7) factors will be used in the selection of firms.  Criteria 1 through 4 are equally important and are more important than Criteria 5.  These five criteria will be used to evaluate firms’ SF 330s during Phase 1.  Criteria 6 and 7, which are of equal value, are less important than Criteria 1 through 4 and are more important than Criteria 5.  These two criteria will be used to evaluate firms’ Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans (QASPs) and Project Management Plans (PMPs) during Phase 2. Should the content of a firm’s QASP and/or PMP impact any of the other five criteria, the ratings for those other criteria shall be revised, as appropriate. An unacceptable rating in any factor will result in no award.

1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE. The firm must demonstrate successful specialized experience of firm and key personnel in the following subfactors (Note: Subfactors are listed in descending order of importance). Experience in developing cost estimates is significantly more important than other subfactors: 

(a)  Experience developing reliable cost estimates for a variety of major multi-million dollar construction projects and/or repair of damaged infrastructure systems (e.g., buildings, roads, schools, hospitals, and power and water systems, etc.).  Cost estimates should reflect the total budget necessary for the project.  Give a detailed explanation of the reasons for any variances that exceed plus or minus 10 percent between estimated and actual costs.  

(b)  Experience in evaluating projects for compliance with environmental regulations and preparing environmental documents (environmental assessments or environmental impact statements); conducting historical or archeological reviews; complying with wetlands and endangered species regulations; reviewing insurance adjustments (all hazards and flood); and evaluating hazardous waste and debris removal issues. 

(c)  Experience in staffing at the levels in Evaluation Factor 2.

(d) Experience developing and implementing quality control measures, including an overall quality control program and implementation of quality control measures at an individual project level.

2. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH WORK WITHIN REQUIRED TIME. The firm must demonstrate the ability to deploy, within 48 hours, the following 300 minimum personnel in the quantities specified, for an eight-month assignment, and of that number, 200 to be available for an additional four months: 

Civil Engineer (50); Structural Engineer (50); Architect (20); Construction Inspector (20); Engineering Technician (20); Estimator (20); Planner, General (15); Soils/Geotechnical Engineer (15); Environmental Planner (10); Insurance Specialist (10); Sanitary Engineer (10); GIS Specialist (5); Electrical Engineer (4); Environmental Engineer (4); Mechanical Engineer (4); Accountant (3); Architectural Historian (3); Certified Public Accountant (3); Coastal Engineer (3); Computer Specialist (3); Financial Analyst (3);  Health Scientist (3); Historical Architect (3); Landscape Architect (3); Archaeologist (2) Geologist (2); Hydrologist (2).  The firm must have one (1) each of the following skills: Appraiser; Arborist; Biologist; Chemical Engineer; Draftsman; Horticulturist; Surveying Technician; Surveyor; Telecommunications Specialist; Wetlands Specialist.

In your description of this factor, you must address how you are going to maintain staffing during the life of the contract, including whether by in-house employees or by subcontractor employees, or a combination thereof. 

3. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. The firm must demonstrate the education, experience, and professional registration/certifications, for staff listed in Evaluation Factor 2. Firms demonstrating extensive knowledge of building codes and standards, floodplain and riverine zones, and seismic and wind zones across the geographic area noted in Factor 5 will be preferred.

4. PAST PERFORMANCE. The agency will evaluate the firm’s past performance on contracts of similar size, type, and scope with Government agencies and private industry in terms of project management, accuracy of costs estimates, cost control, quality control, completion of projects within budget, and compliance with performance schedules. The firm must provide at least five contracts within the past five (5) years with names, affiliations, and telephone numbers, with a narrative discussion.  If the firm is a Joint Venture, contracts performed by its individual members must be included.  In the case of a firm without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  The Government reserves the right to use information outside of the response in evaluating past performance. 

5. LOCATION IN THE GENERAL GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF THE PROJECT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY OF THE PROJECT. Location of personnel in multiple locations is generally indicative of greater flexibility and experience in a wider variety of work that would be tasked under the performance work statement.  The firm must demonstrate how its location(s) support the wide dispersion of disasters to which FEMA would send it in support of this contract.  FEMA’s disasters can occur in any of the following locations:  FEMA’s ten (10) regions, which include the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.

6. QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN. The firm must present an approach to the Government for use in evaluating the firm’s performance should it be awarded a contract.  The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan shall provide a method to be used by the Government to evaluate the following metrics: timeliness, quality, customer service, and cost.

7. PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN.  The firm must demonstrate a comprehensive approach to the overall development, management, and coordination of the contract.  The firm must provide a Project Management Plan in accordance with paragraph 1.2 of the Draft Scope of Work.

General Instructions

Engineering firms interested in performing this work are to submit one (1) original and seven (7) copies of their Standard Form (SF) 330 showing project experience and personnel who will perform the work. Strict adherence to the submission instructions will be enforced. Firms not performing all work in-house must identify subcontractors in their submittal. 

A prime or joint venture SF 330 submittal must not exceed sixty (60) pages, 8 1/2" x 11" front side only. Charts and drawings will be counted as two pages if submitted on 11 x 17" size paper. The 60 page limit does not apply to Part II of the SF 330. Front and back cover pages and tab pages will not be counted in the page limit nor will these pages be evaluated; i.e., any information listed on these pages will be ignored.  All pages following the first sixty (60) pages will be discarded upon receipt. All other material such as brochures or samples of work, attachments or extra pages will be discarded upon receipt. 

All submittals, to include portions from subcontractors, shall use a type pitch that is no smaller than a standard eleven-point font type, with the exception of charts, graphs, or tables, which shall use a pitch no smaller than 10-point. Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture with the chief executive of each entity identified. Copies of agreements between firms participating in a prime/subcontractor relationship must also be included in the submittal. The joint venture and the prime/subcontractor documents will not be subject to the page limitation set forth above. 

All interested large firms are reminded that the successful firms will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected, a small business subcontracting plan will be required prior to award. 

The IVL (Interested Vendors List) feature has been activated on the Vendors portal to FedBizOpps, and firms are encouraged to provide their contact information there to help maximize teaming arrangements and small and small disadvantaged business participation on this procurement.
 
The Government intends to enter into a voluntary partnership arrangement with the awardees and its subcontractors on this procurement. Our objective is to identify and achieve reciprocal goals, insure effective and efficient contract performance, and resolve disputes in a timely, professional and non-adversarial manner through the use of voluntary Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methodologies. 

Responses must reference Synopsis Number HSFEHQ-05-R-0035: Technical Assistance Contract, on the face of all forms and on the outside of the envelope, and submissions must acknowledge notice/receipt of all amendments or modifications. No other announcement is anticipated for this requirement. 

To assure consideration, all information must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 3:00 PM local time, at DHS-Emergency Preparedness and Response, FEMA, 500 C Street, S.W., Room 350, Washington, DC 20472, on September 12, 2005.

<DESC>The VA Medical Center, West Palm Beach FL is conducting market research to identify potential offerors who could provide the following brand name or equal equipment. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   All interested parties must demonstrate that their item is equivalent to this system in all aspects, by submitting descriptive literature, brochures, equipment specifications, etc. by 2:00 PM EST, September 2, 2005.   Items are:  (1) 1 each,  Medi-Stim VeriQ System to include Quad channel volume flow, one channel X-plore channel, two pressure input channels, AUX/EKG input and one additional AUX input.  Active 17” matrix touch screen and Hewlett Packard DeskJet printer; (2) 2 each, 3mm QuickFit probe with handle;  (3) 2 each, 4mm QuickFit probe with handle; (4) 2 each, 5mm QuickFit probe with handle; (5) 2 each, 6mm PeriVascular probe without handle; (6) 2 each, 7.5 MHz X-Plore probe; (7) 2 each, operator manuals; (8) 1 each Service/Maintenance  Manual; (9) 1 each, installation.  Warranty: System – 1 year; Probes – 50 times use or one year, whichever is reached first. This equipment is needed for vascular cases. This equipment allows immediate feedback of vascular flow as soon as the surgeon has completed the anastomosis.  (Sewing veins/arteries together).  It is similar to the Doppler, but it substantially varies because of its ability to wrap around the vessel and project a more accurate and truthful picture of the vascularization taking place within the vessel.  This equipment provides a much more reliable, accurate and scientific method of testing for vascular flow within the vessels, and has the safety component of not having the anastomosis compromised by possible emboli (clotting).  NAICS Code 423450.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Please direct all questions and responses in writing regarding this procurement to Sue Kaiser, Contract Specialist by fax at (561) 422-6507 or by email at sue.Kaiser@med.va.gov.no later than September 2, 2005, at 2:00 PM EST.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation is available.
The Consumer and Retail Food Markets Program, Economic Research Service (ERS), Service, US Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC is responsible for conducting studies on economics of interactions between consumers’ food choices and dynamics of at-home and away-from-home markets. This program has been designed to provide ERS with flexible means of collecting and analyzing primary and extant data, both of which ERS needs to inform policy and decision-making processes. The Economic Research Service (ERS), as the lead economic research arm of the Department, has responsibility to conduct economic research supporting the mission of the Department.  This responsibility includes conducting research and providing information to Department officials on economic issues related to food safety, nutrition and health (including factors related to food choices), consumption patterns at and away from home, food prices, food assistance programs, nutrition education, and food industry structure.  While some of this research can be accomplished using publicly available data, some issues may require collection of new data.    For example, there are no public sources for current information on who is consuming what, how much, where, and what price.  Similarly, there are no public sources for important factors such as consumers’ dietary and health knowledge, attitude, purchasing behavior along with their demographic and health status. While publicly available data are based on large samples, the administration and tabulation of surveys often result in outdated information. A primary objective of the research program is to understand food purchase and consumption patterns of consumers and how these change as people age, households change, new products are introduced, and new information is acquired; identify and develop consistent strategies for consumers in various demographic groups and regions to effectively adopt the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; better understand the market dynamics of food safety and other consumer health issues; and understand links between foods, physical activity and health outcomes; quickly survey consumers about new issues or developments.  Another key objective of the program is to provide real-time information on consumer reactions to unforeseen events and disruptions, current market events, and government policies.  When markets are shocked, effective management of market impacts require a solid understanding of how consumer reactions would be linked to actual food purchases, sales, consumption, and price information. Finally, the program seeks to understand how individual attitudes and knowledge and healthful eating affect food choices, dietary status, and health outcomes. Data needs consist of historical and most recent updates on prices, quantities sold, and total sales volume for various food products (see attached list) on a national, regional, and market (where available) basis across the U.S. for foods consumed either at or away from home. These data would be used to: Examine trends in the retail food market. Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. Measure the impact of food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment. Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Determine the types of foods that U.S. households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups. Identify the prices that households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased. Assess how low-income households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food. In addition, historical and current purchase data are need at item level for food consumed either at or away from home that are based on a demographically and geographically representative sample of U.S. households.  These data will be used to implement research in such issues as: Investigating the impact of USDA's National Organic Program on product differentiation and household demand for differentiated milk products (organic, non-rBGH, and conventional); Identifying what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased; Identifying differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyzing the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility; Investigating the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand; and Measuring the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment. These issues require transaction-level information that would cover food purchases by each household for all restaurants and all food store outlets available to a household and identify the store and restaurants from which each item or meal is purchased.  In addition, all available descriptions such as ‘organic’, ‘non-RBST’, ‘genetically-engineered’, ‘GE’, ‘non-GE’, and/or ‘non-RBGH’ should be clearly identified.  Research would depend on (1) full knowledge of sampling and expenditure weights in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food groups, and (2) a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights and design, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) drive the research.  A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics are particularly important.  All information on household demographics and l outlet details are significant components of successful research implementation.  For food-away-from-home issues, recipes (when available) are critical. 
Food Consumption Special Reports:  Historical and current data and analytical intelligence on consumption (rather than purchase) of foods at and away from home are needed to examine how consumer attitudes and market trend and fads affect consumers diet and health.  For this purpose, consumption data for members of a demographically and regionally representative sample of US household along with rich demographic, including dietary and attitudinal, information is needed. 
Special Requests for Consumer and Market Information: Responding to requests for specific product, brand, or outlet information or anticipating key issues relating to specific foods, customized analyses will be require to examine in detail at a specific product or sub-group of food items for foods consumed either at or away from home.  For example, a report may contain detailed information on the retail trends in orange juice sales or report changes in the type and frequency of beef sales by region by various household (or individual), or restaurant characteristics. In addition, an ad-hoc, drill-down analyses on the impacts of specific policy concerns or unexpected events on specific foods or meals, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items is required.  For example, the influence of low-carb diets on sales of bakery products, restaurant foods, and new product and meal introductions at retail stores and restaurants.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on issues of interest could also be considered. Special requests can quickly provide analytical information on high-profile issues, particularly as they relate to consumers’ attitude and health and knowledge information.  Special requests often call for collecting primary data from panel members on their perceptions, intentions, and attitudes with respect to unforeseen disruption or high-profile market events.  Such information is needed to examine how consumer intentions would impact the market, or match consumers’ actual purchases in the market place.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on these issues would also be of interest.
This “Sources Sought” notice is being published to determine the availability of potential businesses who can provide data and information related to consumers and food market research with experience and interest in analyzing components in foods and dietary supplements listed below. Additionally, provide information on how current the information/data will be at the time of the request.  The Government is very interested in and encourages small businesses to respond.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina, for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to obtain license rights to market and distribute the following radiological detection system to commercial customers.  License rights may be granted on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  WSRC also may be available to assist in further research and development of the technology under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and/or may provide technical assistance during commercialization of the technology under a license agreement.  The technology is a portable detection system that offers advanced methods for the discovery of nuclear materials, often covert, that may be contained within shipping containers, transport containers, trailers, and other enclosed areas where visual inspection may be difficult.  The RadRope ™ Nuclear Materials Detection System allows the inspection of multiple vertical points simultaneously along the shipping containers being inspected.  Utilizing the RadRope allows an inspector to walk the length of the ship and monitor a row of containers, often times stacked three high, in a single pass.  The detector provides identification of any suspect nuclear materials without the time or expense involved to perform manual inspections of nearly seven million shipping containers that pass through U.S. ports every year.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than September 28, 2005, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a license will be required to submit a business plan prior to licensee selection and negotiations.  Company qualifications should include, but not be limited to, compatible product lines, sound product develop plan, reasonable schedule for product launch, established distribution networks, evidence of sufficient financial resources for product development and launch.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Dale K. Haas, telephone (803) 725-4185; fax: (803) 725-4988; email: dale.haas@srs.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #238, Aiken, SC  29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>D -- Annual Maintenance for Stellent Software
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order using Simplified Acquisition procedures with the FORCE3, Inc., Crofton, Maryland, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.   This purchase order will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-5. The purpose of this contract is to purchase annual maintenance for Stellent software.  Transition away from the Stellent software to another software tool is impractical given the enterprise-wide use by NOAA personnel and the associated costs of any alternative.  FORCE3, Inc. is the direct supplier of this software and does not use resellers in the U.S.  A substantial investment has been made to train NOAA personnel to use the Stellent software.  
For the above reasons it would be untimely and too costly for any other firm to provide the services of this requirement.  A one (1) year purchase order is planned.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Logic Analyzer, Sole Source Notice
<DESC>1.	The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc (see attachment 1).  The requirement is to trade in four [4] Agilent 1664A Logic Analyzer models, and buy [4] 1682A Logic Analyzer models for the Department of Electrical Engineering at USAFA CO.  The Department of Electrical Engineering has an important need to acquire more Logic Analyzers to assist them in teaching.  Because there are already Agilent Technologies models in the department, it is essential that the models remain consistent in use and teach-ability aspects.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide similar models for use and compatibility between work stations and test equipment. The 1682A Logic Analyzer from Agilent Technologies is capable of meeting the needs of the USAFA EE Department, departmental teaching criteria and student ease of use requirements.  The Agilent Technologies 1682 A Logic Analyzer model is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334515 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The new devices shall include all of the following characteristics:
a.	A standalone bench top logic analyzer.
b.	Microsoft Windows XP Professional Operating system
c.	Minimum Master to Master Clock Time 5.000 nsec
d.	Probes Maximum Input Voltage +/- 40V Peak AC+DC, CAT 1
e.	Auxiliary Power 1/3 Amp at 5V max per cable, CAT 1
f.	Indoor Environment: Temp 0 C to 55 C.
g.	Indoor Environment: Disk Media 10 C to 65 C.
h.	Indoor Environment: Altitude to 10,000 ft.
i.	Maximum State Speed 200 MHz
j.	64 data channels and 4 clock/data channels
k.	12.0 inch LCD Display or greater.
l.	3.5 inch disk drive
m.	80 GB hard drive or greater.
n.	Centronics and LAN interfaces
o.	IEEE 1394 interface
p.	Variable setup/hold time
q.	512K acquisition memory
r.	Marker measurements
s.	PS/2 mouse
t.	P/S2 keyboard
u.	Printer output
v.	Compatible with Single ended flying lead probes.
w.	Software support for timing measurements and state-based measurements.
x.	To maintain the teach ability requirement the instrument must have the same user interface and operation modes as the Agilent 1682A models already in use. To have different devices will complicate lesson plans, seating assignments, training schedules and disrupt uniform training and teaching of all cadets. 
y.	An instrumental part of the purchase of these Logic Analyzer is the substantial trade-in allowance granted for older versions if logic analyzers on hand. 

Any company that feels they have items that meet the needs of the Government must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

This electronic card key access system has the following salient performance features and characteristics - expandable, electronics and batteries are located in the inside housing protecting them from the ele ments and vandalism, hidden mechanical override and removable core, visual and audible operation indicators, operates on standard batteries, event audit trail tracking, real time system, resists forcible entry even though outside lever is twisted off, meet s American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) grade 1 requirements for lever torque test, and has a durable and scratch resistant finish fully guaranteed for two years. Phases 2E, 2F and 2G are compo sed of sixteen new buildings (two barracks, nine company operations facilities, four battalion headquarters and a brigade headquarters, along with required supporting facilities. In accordance with a directive approved by the Assistant Chief of Staff for I nstallation Management, the Director, Installation Management Agency and the Director for Military Programs on 14 December 2004 and recommendations contained in US Army Corps of Engineers Engineering and Construction Bulletin, No. 2005-1, 18 March 2005, th e Directorate of Public Works (DPW) has implemented a plan to ensure consistency, compatibility, and sustainability for electronic card key access systems for USAG-HI installations. Facilities impacted include all new buildings, barracks as well as adminis trative facilities. This would avoid a proliferation of different brands of card key access systems, minimize/consolidate spare parts and stock, and establish a team of well trained maintenance experts. To sustain these objectives, all new building constru ction should provide Kalba Ilco brand electronic card key system to: (1) Ensure consistency within the Quads I, J and K area (Phase 2, WBR); (2) Ensure compatibility with the systems installed in Phases 2A, 2C and 2D; (3) Ensure maintainability and service ability expertise by DPW staff; and (4) Proven durability and performance of systems installed to date. Utilization of another card key access system would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered t hrough competition. Any interested contractors shall respond by October 13, 2005.

AWARD:  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value for performance of the services identified in this announcement.  In determining the best value to the Government, the tradeoff process of evaluation will be used.  This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors, and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.

Security Requirements for Contractor Personnel: All unescorted Contractor personnel utilized under this award shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any CSOSA facility.  The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background Investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative.  The following forms will be provided and must be completed:  (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor’s Preliminary Background Check Form.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract.  To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor’s Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.  At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR.  Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.  Government’s Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.  (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual's presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011 See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

P/N____________        Mfg __________

The WaveScan is a device that precisely measures and mathematically quantifies the optical properties of the human eye. It is used for two purposes: (a) diagnostically to describe optical properties of the eye which can be used to explain and correlate visual performance and visual symptoms, and (b) therapeutically, to provide surgical treatment parameters to the Visx Excimer Laser for wavefront-guided laser vision correction. These treatment parameters are transferred by electronic media to the laser, which then guides the placement of laser energy to provide a very precise custom ablation profile that is unique for each eye treated.

<DESC>Background and Needs Statement

A long term goal of the Office of Habitat Conservation, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA is to develop a Coral Reefs Education Program directed at middle through high school students which will use two educational books to be used by these students and teachers.  It is planned that the Coral Reefs Reader and Study Guide for students will contain about 150-250 pages each and will  accompanying a Coral Reefs Reader Educators Guide of about 50-100 pages in length. The content of the books shall be appropriate for the designated students, teachers, community educators for adult audiences, and university science, education and writing instruction professors.

The Coral Reefs reader shall provide upper middle and high school students with the knowledge, tools, and skills to engage in discussions about coral reefs and the ability to act on that knowledge; to provide teachers with tools and materials on coral reefs to stimulate student critical thinking, critical reading, research, writing, dialogue, collaboration, and interdisciplinary connections.  This project will support the NOAA Coral Reef Task Force’s mission to increase coral reef literacy, awareness, protection, conservation, and sustainable management; and to potentially introduce students to careers in ocean-related disciplines.

Long Term Goals of the Project - The goal of this project is to establish a basis for which the above books may be completed.  Due to the uncertainty of long term funding for the project, NOAA may use this initial/preliminary development of the proposed books in order to provide a basis for the decisions to decide whether or not complete the long term project.  

Funding/Period of Performance for this purchase order– NOAA has budgeted $30,000 to complete this project for a period of performance of eight(8) months.  

Work Task/Deliverable:   Task l – Specifically, the Contractor shall write and submit for review a final draft of a first chapter of a proposed Coral Reefs Reader, a first chapter of a proposed Study Guide, formatted, and a first chapter of a proposed Coral Reefs Reader Educator’s Guide; an outline of each book; and front and back covers for each.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The contractor's proposal shall include a quality assurance plan, including quality assurance surveillance plan, management information system reporting program, and and performance metri cs/penalties.   A Due Diligence Review/survey can be scheduled, if requested.  This allows prospective contractors to gain a better understandinf othe the SPS JPMO mission objectives and existing conditions.  The SOO is below.   Statement of Objectives Network and System Administration and Management 22 August 2005 1.0	 Background The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) is in the process of acquiring and fielding a commercially based application to support the automation of contracting offices through the Department of Defense (DoD). This program will continue in an evolutionary spiral development cycle for several years and will require the use of modern technologies to perform its mission. In this regard, the SPS JPMO needs to maintain the hardware and software that supports its multiple local area/wide area networks that provide members of the JPMO staff with email and a wide array of office productivity capability, as well as a separate en vironment for testing versions of the SPS application. Support is required to ensure continuity of operations in all mission essential areas including network administration and management, system administration and management, software and hardware instal lation, de-installation, updating and management, security requirements including firewall administration and the application of Information Assurance and Vulnerability Assessments (IAVA), and overall network and computer client and peripheral operations, troubleshooting, inventory management and maintenance. 2.0	Purpose The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the SPS JPMO with computer network and system administration support to ensure the continued operation of all support environments and personal computer assets. 3.0	Scope This acquisition includes a full range of computer services in support of the 50-75 members of the SPS JPMO staff to include technical research, advice and assistance in the following areas: ·	Firewall Installation, Operations and Maintenance ·	Network and System Client Hardware and Peripheral Installation, Operations and Maintenance ·	Network and System Client Software Installation, Operations and Maintenance ·	Overall Network Architecture and System Management ·	Microsoft Exchange Server Operations and Maintenance ·	Hardware/Software Configuration Management ·	Microsoft Office Productivity Software ·	Asset control and tracking 4.0	Period of Performance This acquisition will be awarded for a period of one year. Based exclusively on the contractors performance, however, one option year may be granted. 5.0	Place of Performance The work to be performed under this order will be conducted primarily in the SPS JPMO facility located at 4114 Legato Road, Fairfax, VA 22033. Work may also be performed at the contractors facility or at other government facilities as designated and appro ved by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). Access to other government facilities required for completion of work under this order will be coordinated by the SPS JPMO. 6.0	Program Objectives 6.1	The SPS JPMO maintains three separate and distinct LAN or LAN/WAN environments in support of its mission. These are the Government Test Facility (GTF), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) LAN/WAN and the JPMO Administrative LAN/WAN. The GTF L AN supports SPS app lication development and acceptance testing with military service participation and must be accessible to external activities, while the DCMA and JPMO LAN/WANs provide email and office productivity support to the internal staff. These networks are critical  assets and must be maintained and available on a 24x7/365 basis.  The contractors objective will be to provide 24x7/365 service with a 98 percent level of assurance. This requirement can be satisfied with onsite support during normal working hours and on-call support with a two hour response at all other times. 6.2	To provide meaningful information to its user community and to the general public, the SPS JPMO maintains an Internet web presence and a secure portal. These information resources reside on application and web servers in the JPMO facilities and must be  available to promote the SPS product and the mission of the SPS JPMO.  The contractors objective will be to provide 24x5/365 service with a 98 percent level of assurance. This requirement can be satisfied with onsite support during normal working hours and on-call support with a four hour response at all other times. 6.3	The SPS JPMO is subject to applicable DoD, Army and PEO EIS policy in regards to the security of its networks and system assets. In this regard, the JPMO receives Information Assurance and Vulnerability Assessments (IAVA) on a regular basis. These IAVA s must be researched for applicability to the JPMO environment and appropriate action taken.  The contractors objective is to review all IAVAs that are issued, determine applicability and the take the required action within 10 business days of receipt. 6.4	Per applicable security policy, the JPMO networks and system assets require continuous monitoring to ensure that the firewalls and virus protection software are performing their required functions. Scanning for vulnerabilities and keeping client virus protection current are critical to the security of the JPMO network environment. The contractors objective is to periodically scan the networks for vulnerabilities and to report any intrusion attempts within 1 hour. For client virus protection, the contractor will check for virus definition updates on a weekly basis at a minimum and a pply these updates to all network computer assets. 6.5	The SPS JPMO strives to provide quality computer service and maintenance to its staff. Through the JPMO portal, each member of the staff can submit a technical trouble ticket that addresses specific software or hardware issues they are experiencing. The contractors objective will be to provide a timely response to these requests with a goal of making initial contact within two hours to diagnose and recommend a solution to the issue. 6.6	The SPS JPMO will periodically purchase new network and system equipment to replace aged software, hardware and computer peripheral assets. The contractor will assist with the receipt, assembly, disassembly, packaging, transporting, installation or de- installation of the new equipment, and to ensure the asset is entered into an inventory tracking system, as required. The contractors objective will be to ensure that strict accountability for the new asset is maintained by capturing all documentation related to new equipment and entering pertinent information that fully describes the asset into the SPS JPMOs asset inve ntory database within 24 hours of receipt. 6.7	The SPS JPMO maintains mobile, deployable kits of laptop computers that support its Battle Ready Contingency Contracting System (BRCCS) mission and Training . After use in a battlefield or training environment, these laptop computers must be checked fo r required maintenance and reinitialized. That is, the SPS application database must be cleared, all required software updates applied and any required periodic maintenance must be accomplished.  The contractors objective will be to perform this function within 10 business days of being  notified that BRCCS laptops have been returned to the JPMO for reuse. 6.8	 A significant amount of computer equipment is owned by the SPS JPMO. Some of the equipment is pilferable. Information such as a full description of the item and its location has been entered into a local database. Controlling these assets and ensuring  that government equipment is not lost or stolen is a critical function of the JPMO technical staff.  To ensure that this equipment is properly accounted for, the contractor will be required to perform a complete semi-annual inventory with all discrepancies adjudicated within 10 working days of completion. 6.9	 A central component of the SPS JPMO Windows network is management of the Windows Active Directory. Active Directory services provide the means to manage the identities, relationships and group policies that are integral to network operations. The contractors objective is to make appropriate changes within 24 hours of being notified that a modification is required. 6.10	A network as complicated as that maintained by the SPS JPMO has many components. Not all of the integral components are detailed in these objectives. Therefore, the contractor may be asked to perform other functions directly related to the system and/ or network environment. These other functions may include, but are not limited to, data backup, Blackberry support, HP digital sender support, printer maintenance, copier maintenance, network router operations and maintenance, firewall operations and maint enance, compact disc (CD) duplication, liaison with PEO EIS and the DOIM, annual conference support, network architecture assessments and updates, and support of any other peripheral that may be procured and identified as directly related to the SPS JPMO n etwork infrastructure. The contractors objective is to be flexible and to develop a quantifiable metric for each item that is consistent with the goal of providing timely and quality computer support to the SPS JPMO staff. 6.11	The SPS JPMO requires that all contractors communicate, coordinate and cooperate to ensure harmonious and effective performance that is in line with its mission. 7.0	Management and Technical Constraints The SPS JPMOs automated capabilities must conform to the architectural and/or interoperability standards set forth in the Army AR-25-1 and AR25-2, and, if required, to the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) directiv es, and other DoD or Army network guidance that may be applicable. Contractor access to vendor proprietary data may be required. Proprietary information obtained under this acquisition will not be used for any purpose other than that for which it was intended. The contractor will be required to provide a plan that clearly  describes the contractors roles, responsibilities and strategies The contractor may be required to provide on-call operational surge support on a 24x7/365 basis with a two to three hour response. The contractor must have the capability to participate in frequent meetings with the JPMO staff located at the JPMO facility in Fairfax, VA, as well as with the PEO EIS and DOIM staff located in Ft. Belvoir, Woodbridge, VA. 8.0	Contract Data Requirements In response to the governments statement of objectives, the contractor shall submit a proposal that details the personnel, product, schedule, deliverables and projected costs of each task to be performed under this acquisition. The contractor shall not be gin a task until the order has been awarded. Project accomplishments and results shall be documented in a monthly report that includes projected and actual hours on each contract effort. The contractor shall report financial data under this acquisition using a formal financial system that operates in accordance with accepted commercial accounting standards. It is preferred that this data be provided in electronic form. Reportable data will  include, but i s not limited to, performance metrics and earned value or earned value-like system data.  The Government intends to issue an award based on the proposal offering the best value solution.  The Government reserves the right to not award a contract as a result of this competition, if in the opinion of the Source Selection Official (SSO), none of the submitted proposals would provide satisfactory performance.  The SSO may reasonable determine that the superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government.  The SSO, using sound business judgement , will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors.  Factor 1 - Technical/Management Solution/Approach.  Factor 2 - Performance Measurement and Management Pr ogram.  Factor 3 - Past Experience (include references for all contracts for the last 2 years).  Factor 4 - Price.  Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the price factor will be an important part of the i ntegrated selection decision, the non-price evaluation factors are significantly more important than the price factor.  However, Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for non-price factors approach equal.  Evidence of the quality of the technical/management solution/approach includes:  (a) a coherent, actionable and realistic concept of operations that clearly articulates the operational aspects of a performance-based partnership and explicitly describes the expected perfor mance of the Government and contractor teams.  (b) A comprehensive performance workk statement and contract work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of obj ectives.  (c) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, standard, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive compliant, and cost effective services to meet the needs of the SP S JPMO and its stakeholders.  (d) A sound partnering approach to managment that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to the SPS JPMO's business processes.  The management approach provides:  1.  Highl y qualified and experienced personnel with a proven track record of success.  2.  Transparent governance procedures that include clear lines of open and honest communication between the Contractor's team and the Government for timely problem identification , mitigation and resolution.  Program clearly fosters a partnering environment that is based on achieving shared goals and objectives.

<DESC>Amendment 01 of Solicitation 05-3K06-570

I.	Questions & Responses

Q1:  	What are the crop classes of interest? 

R1:	The crop classes are determined by whatever the majority crop covers in the state are.  For instance, the majority covers in IL/IN/IA are corn, soybeans and winter wheat.  In North Dakota the majority covers include allwheat, spring, durum and winter wheats, barley, beets, canola, sunflower, corn, drybeans, oats, potatoes, rye, soybean and flaxseed.

Q2:	What level of land cover identification is desired? 

R2:	The NASS June Agricultural Survey defines the categories that NASS uses for training.  Additional categories can be created using partner’s datasets of extra training sets, or the analyst can derive additional signatures using manual crop identification techniques.

Q3:	Is clubbing together of similar crop areas allowed?

R3:	NASS is not sure of the meaning of clubbing, but its analysis method takes all of the usable training fields located within an analysis district, or multiple satellite scene footprint area with the same observation date.  These training fields are then separated out by cover type and clustered individually. This provides unique training signatures for each cover type.  The signatures are then appended together for classification and accuracy assessment.

Q4:	Which satellite images are used? 

R3:	Landsat 5/7, ResourceSat1 AWiFS/LISS

Q5:	Can we have images from 2 seasons: one with standing crop, and another without crop?

R5:	NASS prefers to have two dates of imagery to separate the non ag cover types with the planted ag.  Spring followed by mid-summer is preferred for our processes.  In ag areas, the spring scenes of bare fields help separate out ag vs. non ag, and the crop’s spectral reflectance allows for differentiation of the mid-summer scenes.

 
Q6:	What techniques are used to identify the crops from the satellite images?

R6:	NASS uses the June Agricultural Survey (JAS) which is an enumerative survey that runs the first two weeks of every June.  During the survey, selected sample sites are visited and the growers are queried on crop type and acreage, providing the necessary training data for the year.  Follow-up surveys are a possibility in the case of a refusal or inaccessible location at the time on the JAS.  These surveys provide the training data for our remote sensing program.

Q7:	Only spectral properties or other information are used?

R7:	The spectral reflectance properties are what drive our clustering/classification algorithms.  A supervised modified ISODATA clustering algorithm is used for clustering, and a maximum likelihood classifier is used for classification.

Q8:	Will NASS be interested in testing the textural properties of the image for crop identification?

R8:	NASS is interested in researching the concept of textual properties as well as object-based classifiers, but operational demands of the program have kept the research of these new techniques in low priority research mode currently.

Q9:	How does the 'regression estimator' measure the acreage?

R9:	A regression estimation approach is applied using classified pixels as the independent variable and farmer reported acres as the dependent variable in a set of area frame stratum based simple linear regressions.  The county and state crop acreage estimates produced by this system greatly reduce the sampling variation ('error') found in the estimates produced by the ground data alone; and have the added benefits of producing county estimates with measurable precision.  

Q10:	Please direct us to the literature on the 'regression estimator.'

R10:	Day, C.D. (2002) "A Compilation of PEDITOR Estimation Formulas". RDD Research Paper RDD-02-03, USDA, NASS, Washington, D.C. January, 2002.

 
Q11:	What accuracy of classification is desired? 

R11:	It is desirable to have accuracies greater than 85 percent overall, and in the mid-nineties if the imagery was collected during optimum times during the growing season.  It is critical to have accuracies in the low to mid-nineties for the crops that we are estimating.  It is also necessary, to have r-squares that are greater than .8, again it is image quality driven.

Q12:  Please direct us to the report on the accuracy values of the recent                                  
          classification.

R12:	There are no accuracy values online, but there exists some image metadata online @ http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/metadata/meta.htm

The following questions and their corresponding answers are provided in response to those questions submitted by contractors:

1. Question: How much of the infrastructure is copper cable?
Answer: 98%

2. Question: How much of the infrastructure is fiber optic cable?
Answer: 2%

3. Question: Does the Government provide any test equipment such as Fireberds, or Optic Time Domain Reflectometers?
Answer: No.

4. Question: If fiber optic work is done, does the Government have a preference of mechanical or fusion splicing?
Answer: Circumstances of repair dictate repair method.

5. Question: The solicitation mentions travel to other locations.  What are the other locations, how often is travel required, how long will the technician be needed at the other site, and how are we to provide pricing for these?

6. Question: Will there be a site survey and/or pre-proposal conference?

All quote submissions, however, must include a detailed breakdown of costs that show how the contractor developed its monthly price.  This is stated in the solicitation.

10. Question: Will the contractor be responsible to provide any parts or material in support of this contract?

Answer: 5.1.1.1 - 10%;    5.1.1.2 - 2%;    5.1.1.3 - 20%;    5.1.1.4 - 30%;    5.1.1.5 - 5%;    5.1.1.6 - 10%;    5.1.1.7 - 10%;  5.1.1.8 - 5%;      5.1.1.9 - 3%;    5.1.1.10 - 5%.

13. Question: Is OEM Maintenance Certification on the Avaya Definity G3r PABX needed for all support technicians proposed?

<DESC>The synopsis is amended to answer questions from a potential offeror.  The questions and answers are as follows:

1.	The solicitation specifies a container that is 8 ft. in height.  Is this an   
      absolute requirement, or will an 8.5 ft. container work just as well?

       An 8.5 ft. tall container is acceptable as long as it can be hauled without special permits.  All other standard sea transport and lock down conditions must be met.  Also, these containers must be compatible with the existing 
AMRFC trailers.

2.	Can the containers be used containers (one or two years old and "once used") or is the requirement that they be completely new, ground up construction?

Although "once used" is acceptable, one or two years old is not.

3.	Unit 3 has a drawing that indicates a 10 ft. long container, but the verbiage is for a 20 ft. container.  Is Unit 3 a 10 ft. container or a 20 ft. container?

Unit 3 is a 10 ft. container.

4.	Units 1 and 2 are almost identical but the AC and heat requirements are somewhat different.  It also appears that the AC and heat requirements for Unit 3 are larger than necessary if Unit 3 is a 10 ft. container.  Are the requirements as stated correct?

Yes.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETION
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
12TH CONTRACTING SQUADRON
RANDOLPH AFB TX 78150-4525

(i) 	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency?s needs:

The proposed action is for the purchase of a ColorSpan 60? DisplayMaker model 72 SR inject, solvent printer and related accessories for use in the Graphics Branch support of numerous customers at Randolph AFB TX to include HQ AETC, HQ AFPC, HQ Recruiting Service and other 12 FTW tenants.
     
(ii)	Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1 (c) - Application for brand name      
             descriptions.  

(iii)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor?s unique qualification or the 
            nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  

Currently we are not able to produce large displays for the Wing and Command that are long lasting and capable of being displayed outdoors in harsh environment.  Present printing technology/equipment is designed to produce only indoor products with a limited ability for long lasting use.  This manufacturer is the only product capable of providing 60? solvent-ink printer.  The Multimedia Center has been using this brand (indoor inks) for the last three (3) years.  Failure to maintain this environment will introduce undetermined complications from hardware mixtures that will significantly increase the complexity of maintaining existing configuration control of these critical devices.  Substantial man-hours have been spent on training of personnel a well as costs incurred in the acquisition of the current printer.  The Air Force will not need to reinvest in specific training for another brand of printer.  Additionally, due to the humidity problems that exist in hangar 6, the above printer is best suited for this environment.  The system includes a self-cleaning and sensor system, which results in less waste of supplies and manpower.  This printer can print on rigid poster boards to roll-to-roll flexible media, such as vinyl, canvas, paper and fabrics.  The printer is capable of utilizing archival ink and print products giving the end product longer shelf life.  This would realize a cost savings of approximately $28,000 and half to three-quarters production time.  The government has expended approximately $215,000 for the current ColorSpan (indoor ink) printer.  It would be cost prohibitive and not in the best interest of the government to procure this printer from a different manufacturer.

(iv)       A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or  
                 overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for 
                 the supplies or services is required:  

Until it is determined that the current printer no longer meets the Government?s requirements, the ColorSpan 72 SR inkjet will be utilized.  In addition, until other firms can provide compatibility with the existing system, to include upgrades that meet the Government?s needs, it would be neither reasonable nor feasible to consider any other brand.  To ensure the above is met, 12 CS/SCSG will however, continue to evaluate the capabilities of other manufacturer?s through continuing market research and the changing needs of the current system.  Continued efforts in this regard will ensure that the Government is getting the best value at a fair and reasonable price by ensuring the Government utilizes the most efficient and economical components and support

Contracting Officer?s Certification:  The contents of this justification and approval are certified as accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer?s knowledge and belief.

Technical personnel certification of accuracy:   The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified to be complete and accurate, to the best of their knowledge and belief, by the technical/requirements organization.
