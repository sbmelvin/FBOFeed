<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a fixed price contract for laboratory studies on antiretroviral drug resistance and HIV subtypes for selected HIV-1 strains from throughout the United States.  The majority of the specimens will be sera.  Two methods shall be used by the contractor, the first, genotypic characterization, shall be used on all serum and plasma specimens and involves amplification by PCR methods and direct genetic sequencing of all the protease and the first 333 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase area of the HIV-1 virus.  The second, phenotypic characterization of antiretroviral susceptibility to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors, shall be used on a subset of specimens, determined by the project officer, through a recombinant virus assay.  The vendor shall use all of the protease and at least the first 333 amino acids of the RT region, using the same amplified material as for the genotypic analysis.  The contractor shall possess the following minimum qualifications to perform these tasks:  the contractor must be able to perform sequencing for genotypic analysis and conduct phenotypic analysis by an established recombinant virus assay or subcontract to have the phenotypic analysis performed.  The contractor (or its subcontractor) shall have experience in providing specialized information through phenotypic drug susceptibility.  The contractor must be capable of providing genotypic results to the Department of Health and CDC within 30 days of specimen receipt, and phenotypic results within 30 days of receipt of the request to perform phenotyping.  The contractor must have published articles on antiretroviral drug resistance.  The anticipated performance period is 36 months or when 4,610 specimens have been genotyped and, based on the genotypic results, when approximately 560 of those specimens have been phenotyped, whichever comes first.  An option for the genotyping of up to 10,090 additional specimens, and the phenotyping of up to 1,150 specimens, may be exercised during this time period.  The solicitation will be issued as a full and open competition procurement.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about July 12, 2002.

Proposal Submission Place:  Mayor Traian Basescu, Mayor of Bucharest, Bd. Elisabeta Nr. 47, Bucharest, Romania, Tel. + 40 1 315 84 29, Fax + 40 1 312 00 30, Email:  primar@pmb.ro  :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance in the preparation and evaluation of tender documents for the procurement and installation of a Municipal Information Technology (IT) System.

The Municipality of Bucharest prepared a technical specification and Request for Proposals (RFP) for the procurement and installation of a Municipal IT System.  This opportunity was advertised in August 2001.  After a lengthy evaluation period, and multiple requests for clarification from the competitors, one respondent was selected and a contract written.  After multiple protests, an extended review period, and confirmation of the propriety of the bidding process, the contract was cancelled.

The Municipality has an urgent need for the IT system specified.  In order to move forward with this project, however, the Municipality needs an outside advisor to set the parameters of the project. 

This Technical Assistance is designed to assist the Municipality in managing the procurement process and aid in managing the implementation of the project itself.  The Terms of Reference (TOR) includes: 1) a revision of the specifications, 2) a restructuring of the RFP, 3) developing procurement and evaluation process, 4) assisting in contract award, and 5) preparing a final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $76,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed RFP, which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, July 24, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Senior Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>ABSTRACT:  INEEL has developed an in situ, flow through reactor easily deployed and applicable to both vadose and saturated zones.  Subsurface cores under interrogation may be monitored and manipulated in real time and monitoring can be performed in either continuous or batch modes. These attributes make the invention ideally suited to assessing most remediation technologies at hazardous waste cleanup sites. Unique features include: near-undisturbed subsurface operation; simple deployment with existing hardware; controllable from the surface; and the ability to retrieve soil cores for further assessment or safe disposal.  The device provides: more predictive treatability studies; reduced cost for overall cleanup, greatly reduced cost for remedial investigation; improved assessment of remediation alternatives; high field replication for treatment strategies; positive and negative controls in the field; lower amounts of waste from investigations; and deployment in existing treatment plumes for ?remediation tuning?

BENEFIT SUMMARY: This device replaces lab work for hazardous waste treatability studies aimed at assessing remediation technologies.

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI2075   and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-07.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisitions procedures with Beckman-Coulter, Inc. of Fullerton, Ca. for one hundred and forty-four (144) HIV P-24 Antigen Kits, Catalogue Number 6604535.  This is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325413 and the small-business size standard is 500.  This is an indefinite delivery contract:  The kits are to be delivered to a NIAID facility located in Bethesda, MD. 20852 at intervals and in quantities to be determined by the end-user/requestor during the anticipated period of performance of August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003.  This is a firm, fixed-priced contract and the FOB terms are ?Destination.?  These kits will be used to detect the levels of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication in infected cells.  These kits are both accurate and sensitive.  They allow us to detect viral antigens in both culture supernatants and patient samples, over a wide range of concentrations.  Moreover, these kits detect viral antigens from all five major subgroups of HIV which is an important consideration as our ongoing projects will include the analysis of patient and viral material from sub-Saharan Africa as well as Southeast Asia.  The laboratory has established protocols and procedures specific to these kits, thus their purchase will allow the laboratory to continue functioning in an efficient and productive manner.  Consequently, it is essential that these same kits continue to be used in order to maintain data integrity.  Changing variables would prevent the correct interpretation of a number of experiments and thus cause harm to those experiments and the mission of the Institute.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items.  FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act also applies.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.  Offers must be submitted not later than 4:30 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time July 30, 2002.   For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 6700B Rockledge Drive/MSC 7605, Room 1130; Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7605.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Guy Baratte at (301) 594-5075.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Internal Revenue Service intends to procure the Thru-Put Manager software package from MVS Solutions Inc. to be implemented on two IBM Z-900 mainframe platforms at one of the agency's computing centers.  Systems Programming personnel have identified the need to improve and enhance the efficiency, flexibility, and serviceability of batch operations in both the Current and evolving Modernization processing environments.  Up to now modifications to batch operations have been executed via Job Entry Subsystem (JES2) exit routines written in Assembler Language.  However, owing to the mounting costs and complexities associated with developing and maintaining these exit routines and policies directing that the use of such "locally developed" code be discontinued, the Center has decided to move to a Commercial Off The Shelf.  Systems Programming personnel have identified a lengthy list of criteria and functional requirements for potential COTS alternatives, and after protracted research and evaluation have determined that Thru-Put Manager (including the Job Binding feature) is the only product available which satisfies all of the center's rigorous requirements.   All quotes shall include if applicable, delivery date, business size and payment terms.  No solicitation will be issued, therefore such requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive.  All questions must be submitted in writing.

If no other compelling sources are identified within fifteen (15) calendar days of issuance of this notice, Internal Revenue Service will proceed with the acquisition of the Thru-Put Manager software package from MVS Solutions Inc.

Responsible sources wishing to respond to this synopsis should contact Ouida Reynaud, IRS Contracting Officer, on (202) 283-1123 or via electronic mail at <ouida.c.reynaud@irs.gov>.  Technical questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to Timothy LaMoy, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, on (202) 283-6914 or via electronic mail at <timothy.lamoy@irs.gov>.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (3-204658) for  ONE EACH EMSCAN NEXUS PLUS CONTROLLER (P/N 2001-1000) AND SCANNER MODULE (SM-1700)(P/N 2001-5000. NASA GRC requires the Emscan hardware system for measuring digital circuit board EMI emissions.  Emscan is required because it is the only product capable of providing continuous spatial scanning of an entire circuit board's emi emissions.  (Continuous scanning of the circuit board under design is required at GRC because digital circuits are upset primarily by transient events, which can only be captured with the Emscan system.)  The Emscan system is patent protected; so other circuit board scanning systems are constrained to the use of a single probe system that is moved below the circuit board, which cannot provide instantaneous monitoring of an entire board; this (single probe) is therefore unable to fill the requirement. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from EMSCAN. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 7-5-02. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325998 and the small business size is 500. SCHEDULE: The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) Pathogen Molecular Genetics Section 1) identifies new virulence genes involved in the pathogenesis of infections caused by bacteria of special interest such as group A Streptococcus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus; 2) elucidates the role of new virulence genes in complex interactions between pathogen and host; 3) studies pathogen and host molecules and environmental factors that participate in regulating pathogen virulence genes; 4) elucidates the molecular genetic basis of tissue and host species tropism of bacterial pathogens. The LHBP has several large-scale genomics projects in progress and several planned for the near future.  These projects necessitate the microarray of a large number of oligonucleotides.  The oligonucleotides are to be spotted on a glass slide for a microbial genome microarray project.  The oligonucleotides must be 70mers, computed for all the open reading frames provided by the Laboratory in FASTA file format to guarantee optimal and comparable hybridization in this project.  The oligonucleotides must have the following features: 1) All oligos must be within +/- 5?C; 2) Each oligo must be designed with 750 to 1,000 bases from the 3? end of the available gene sequence; 3) each oligo must be scanned for contiguous single nucleotide bases repeats or poly (N) tracts; 4) Each oligo must be scanned for stems in potential hairpin structures. No hairpin stem lengths longer than 9 bases are allowed; 5) A normalized score will be assigned to each oligo based on the number of repeats present.  Oligos with many repeats having a normalized score greater than a certain threshold (to be determined by the Laboratory) will be filtered out; 6) Each oligo must be designed to have no more than 20 contiguous bases common to any other gene; 7) Each designed oligo must use BLAST so that each oligo is aligned to all the known genes, predicted ORFs, and/or ESTs for that organism; 8) The BLAST percent identity (cross-hybridization homology or similarity of the oligo) must be calculated as percent identity score ? dependent on the size of the sequence database used to BLAST against the oligo sequence; 9) Oligos must be purified using size exclusion techniques; 10) The custom microarray set must contain only 70-mers; 11) The custom microarray set must have 12 unique negative controls designed to have no homology with any ORF contained in the dataset from which it is designed; 12) The custom microarray set must contain 12 unique positive control probes that represent housekeeping genes; 13) Quality control must be performed by PAGE on a minimum of 5% of the probes; 14) Delivery format is to be either 384 well plates, 96 well plates or tubes.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for "Space Launch Initiative (SLI) Cost Estimating Support."  The proposed contract is planned for other than full and open competition with PRICE Systems, L.L.C., 17000 Commerce Parkway, Suite A, Mount Laurel, NJ. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  The purpose of this effort is to provide professional engineering and cost estimating services in support of the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) using the PRICE Model.  The PRICE Systems Model (Parametric Review of Information for Costing and Evaluation) is a computerized method for deriving cost estimates of electronic and mechanical hardware assemblies and systems.  PRICE Systems is the creator of the model and holder of proprietary information concerning its integration and use.  PRICE Systems is in the unique situation to provide expert insight in its operations and applications to the SLI Program and to provide training and mentoring of the basic functions and cost drivers of the model, in combination with cost estimating services.  This effort is a follow-on of a PRICE Systems subcontract under NAS8-02047, which set the stage for continuing cost estimation by establishing the PRICE-based model calibrated with cost factors adjusted to represent the historical cost of the Shuttle. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on July 10, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified, responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:    http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>DESC: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, anticipates negotiating a license agreement with a U.S. company interested in commercializing the ADVISOR (ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR) software described below.  ADVISOR has a large and documented user base (more than 5000), and can be viewed as an industry standard for analyzing system level vehicle issues, advanced propulsion system concepts, and for trading off the benefits and performance of automotive propulsion system components with varying specifications and attributes.  To date ADVISOR has been distributed at no cost as an open source file on the worldwide web and its registered users are diverse.  They include automotive manufacturers and suppliers, universities and technical institutes, research laboratories, and government organizations.  
	NREL is seeking collaboration with a commercial partner to continue supporting and upgrading ADVISOR as required for the software to achieve success as a commercially available product.  NREL intends to continue using ADVISOR in support of the DOE?s transportation program goals.  Therefore, we seek to develop and maintain an active and mutually beneficial collaboration with our licensee/partner.  NREL has three objectives that we would like to accomplish through the grant of a license:  (1) To transfer the code to a private sector partner with a strong interest in increasing the use of the software within the automotive OEM, supplier and design/analysis communities;  (2) To receive fair, reasonable and customary monetary compensation for the investment that DOE has made to date in developing ADVISOR to its current level;  (3) To increase the current analysis capabilities within the transportation programs at NREL through staff training and acquisition of advanced proprietary automotive modeling and simulation tools provided by our commercial partner.  NREL is seeking unique proposals from offerers who are motivated to develop a business plan that:  builds upon what ADVISOR has been designed to do; further improves and enhances the code; increases the number and quality of component databases accessible to ADVISOR users; continues to improve the overall product and its packaging through periodic product updates; and links the code with other complimentary commercial software design and analysis tools.
To support DOE goals to reduce automotive fuel consumption and emissions, NREL developed ADVISOR.  It is essentially an analysis software package capable of providing fast and accurate simulations of a wide variety of vehicle configurations, with an emphasis on advanced powertrains and design optimization for fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.  ADVISOR provides a specialized tool for the automotive engineering community to quickly simulate the performance of a large number of vehicle design options, therefore reducing the time and expense involved in building and testing prototypes.
ADVISOR is written in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and is easy to use, flexible yet robust, and supported by an analysis package for vehicle modeling.  It is primarily used to quantify the fuel economy, performance, and emissions of vehicles that use advanced propulsion system technologies such as fuel cells, batteries, electric motors, and internal combustion engines in hybrid (i.e. multiple power sources) configurations. In processing simulations, ADVISOR uses a unique combination of traditional backward facing models with forward facing feedback that results in fast execution time and accurate performance.  
An extensive database of vehicle components and configurations is included with ADVISOR.  This database includes detailed data on 23 different engines (gasoline and diesel), 25 electric motors, 7 fuel cells, 23 traction batteries  (including lead-acid, nickel-metal hydride, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, and nickel-zinc), 18 different powertrain control strategies, as well as various exhaust systems, transmissions, torque couplers, wheels and axles, and accessory loads. NREL is not aware of any other vehicle simulation software that contains an equivalent depth of component data.  Input data has been collected from industry partners, ADVISOR users throughout the world, and research laboratories. 
ADVISOR contains a wealth of detailed data, sophisticated component models, and is extremely flexible.  It provides a broad range of possibilities for conducting computer simulations of standard vehicle test procedures, as well as many non-standard driving cycles along with the ability to generate special, customized test procedures.  Simulations produce many detailed calculations including vehicle dynamics, electrical systems, gas flow rates, and thermal system models that are performed for each individual component during each second of the driving cycle.  ADVISOR performs these calculations quickly without sacrificing accuracy.  A letter from one user shows that they have achieved accuracy within 4%, when compared to their test data, using ADVISOR to simulate the operation of a hybrid transit bus.	
Qualifications of potential licensee: Respondents to this announcement should be familiar with the analysis needs of the automotive industry and capable of demonstrating expertise in the design, development and marketing of commercial modeling and simulation software. Respondents should be prepared to produce a business plan or commercialization pathway for ADVISOR that clearly demonstrates their ability to maintain and grow the existing userbase.  Companies with the ability to validate models through full-scale or bench testing of components and systems are particularly encouraged to respond to this announcement.  Teaming arrangements would be an option to consider for respondents who do not have in-house validation capability. As previously stated, one objective of NREL?s transportation program is to expand and enhance our existing analysis capabilities.  Therefore, offerings that include in-kind contributions in the form of limited-use software licenses, access to proprietary databases and staff training are encouraged.  In addition, respondents may feel it is necessary to retain NREL ADVISOR development staff to affect a timely and orderly transfer of the technology to the licensee.  In that case, the respondents ability to fund the labor necessary to transfer the technology will be considered a component of the overall compensation package for the license.  Creative proposals are encouraged, however the respondent will have the burden of demonstrating the present and future values of any in-kind contributions that are included in their offering. 
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  NREL reserves the right to withdraw this announcement of our intent to license ADVISOR if it does not produce responses that substantially address our vision for commercialization.
Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or Email:  richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<SUBJECT>13--WHITE PHOSPHORUS MUNITIONS FILLING - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>DAAD13 -- N/A
<RESPDATE>071202
<ARCHDATE>08112002
<CONTACT>George Hunt, 410-436-4192
<DESC>NA WHITE PHOSPHORUS MUNITIONS FILLING  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Governmen t to form a binding contract.  The Government is required to consider private sources whenever the net increase to government capital investment in an activity will exceed 30%, per OMB Circular A-76 instructions.  Initial indications are that the Governmen t will exceed this threshold.  BACKGROUND: The existing White Phosphorus (WP) munitions filling facility located at Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), Pine Bluff, Arkansas, has been in operation since the 1950s.  The existing systems are labor intensive and require  manual handling of heavy and hazardous materials.  The dip fill system is environmentally unfriendly by generating large quantities of solid and liquid waste.  The pollution abatement infrastructures for this facility are old and may not meet future Envir onmental Regulations.  OBJECTIVE: This RFI is intended to be a market survey for availability of a commercial source for the filling of WP munitions.  It may also allow interested parties the opportunity to participate in the planning of the upgrade of the  WP facility at PBA.  The present facility and equipment are aging rapidly and may not be operable within the next 3-5 years.  However, there will be requirements for WP filled ammunition for years to come.   The Government must determine if it is more cos t effective to re-capitalize the existing facility or contract with a commercial firm to fill the WP munitions for the U.S. Army.  The existing system capacity is 2,660,071 lb. of WP storage and average line rate of 4,000 munitions per day.  The proposed s ystem will size to current and future needs.  It will have a capacity to store 574,000 lb. of WP and produce an average of 1,800 ammunitions per day.  WHITE PAPER INSTRUCTIONS: Interested parties should submit a white paper limited to twenty (20) pages, do uble-spaced, single sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  White papers shall be submitted in an original plus two copies, and are due no later than 14 calendar days after the publication or posting of this notice, 4:00 p.m., EST.  The Government reserves the right to review any late submissions.  Submit white papers to the technical point of contact, Mr. Emami Esmaeilpour, Attn: AMSSB-ET, Pine Bluff Arsenal71602.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Esmaeilpour at 870-540-2911 or email emami.esmaeilpour@pba.a rmy.mil.  White papers become the property of the Government, and will be reviewed by the Government and support contractors; therefore any restrictions on submissions should be clearly marked.  The Government reserves the right to, but is not obligated to , contact interested parties concerning their submissions for additional information, and may contact contractors regardless of whether or not they submit a white paper.  The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any co sts incurred in responding or in subsequent exchanges of information.

<SUBJECT>T -- Preservation Microfilming - Part 1
<SOLNBR>Not-Applicable-Sole-Source
<CONTACT>Daniel Hartinger, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email HARTIND@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to contract with Atlis Systems, Inc. (Atlis), which is located at 8728 Colesville Road, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, on a sole-source basis to add two new line items to the current contract number N01-LM-1-3528.  The current fixed price, indefinite delivery (indefinite quantity) type contract is for the preparation of library materials for microfilming as a means of preservation.  The current contract includes specific line items for all routine tasks.  However, occasionally there is a need for the contractor to perform a special procedure or one-time project, which is directly related to the current statement of work.  The purpose of this requirement is to allow for up to approximately 100 hours for a librarian and up to approximately 400 hours for a collator/record specialist during each of the four option years  remaining under the current contract.  The work under this contract is performed onsite at NLM.  Atlis' staff have the extensive training in collation, book handling, use of Atlis' tracking file, and the maintenance of NLM's data files required to perform the current statement of work.  Atlis has designed and currently maintains the unique tracking system created specifically for the performance of the current contract.  The unique capabilities and experience of the current contractor, inherent duplication of cost and effort to the government, logistical constraints on site, and delays in preparation which would impact the related contractor for microfilming make competition for this effort unfeasible.  This notice of intent is not a Request For Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.   Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to Atlis for this contract without full and open competition is planned. (See numbered notes 22 and 26.)

However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested offerors may submit a quote.***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) Hand and Foot Radioactive Contamination Monitor with state of the art PC based components, background correction algorithms, and remote alarm notifications.***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) each Hand and Foot Radioactive Contamination Monitor with state of the art PC based components, background correction algorithms, and remote alarm notifications.. The Monitor shall meet the following required specifications: (1) The detectors shall be beta sensitive and capable of suppressing external the gamma background from Cs-137, Co-60 or x-rays caused by shielding high energy charged particles. Background suppression may be accomplished with a combination of detector design and/or integral shielding. (2) The detectors shall cover at least 250 cm2 for each location (for each hand or foot) and allow for an open area where transmission is not impeded by grids or supports of at least 58 percent. The mesh on the grid must be tight enough to prevent the detectors from being ruptured by small objects such as a dropped pen. Separate detectors are required for each monitored area. (3)  The monitor shall be capable of detecting contamination of S-35 with maximum beta energy of 0.167 MeV. Other contamination isotopes to be detected include Sr-90, P-32, U-238, I-125, I-131. The monitor shall have a minimum efficiency of 10 percent for a point source of Co-60. (4) The monitor shall be capable of alarming for performance testing with 0.01 uCi of Sr/Y-90 and 0.1 uCi of Cs-137 within a reasonable counting time (less than 30 seconds) while operating in a variable external gamma background condition up to 2 mrem/hr (range 0.005 to 2 mrem/hr.) (5) The monitor shall automatically sense the presence of the user and start the counting sequence. Manual buttons or switches that must be pushed by the user will not satisfy this requirement. (6) The monitor shall include a frisking probe with alarming capabilities for checking tools, equipment, wheels on carts, and other items. Cable lengths must satisfy these tasks. (7) The frisking probe shall provide some means (audible or visual) to gauge the response while the user can not directly view the main display on the monitor unit. (8) The monitor shall have both audible and visual indication of an alarm and location of the detector originating the alarm. (9) The monitor shall include connections to allow remote alarm notifications. (10) The monitor shall include provisions for a printout (ie, a printer port) or easily readable computer file indicating alarm and usage history that NIST Health Physics staff may review. (11) The monitor shall be PC based to allow easy upgrade of the program and supporting files (such as audio WAV files, on screen instructions etc) as needed. (12) The controlling algorithm shall include alarm point settings, calibration efficiencies, and readout units that may be adjusted by NIST Health Physics staff. (13) The algorithm shall include maximum count time settings that are selectable by NIST Health Physic staff. (14) The algorithm shall include an automatic background update to correct the active count. (15) The monitor shall include provisions for the user to save the background, usage, and maintenance history to a computer file or print out while the monitor remains available for normal contamination monitoring. The algorithm shall include a mode to automatically and periodically transmit this data to an external PC, a computer disk, or a printer
unless the system stores the data internally in an easily retrievable and readable manor. (16) The monitor components shall be designed for easy access for decontamination and repair. (17) The monitor shall automatically reset to the user specified parameters and return to service following any power interruptions. (18) The monitor shall be designed to minimize operating and maintenance requirements. Sealed proportional detectors (instead of gas flow) shall be used to meet this requirement. (19) Submissions with regularly sold "Off the Shelf" and "Turn key" systems are preferred and prototype or first of a kind offerings shall be discouraged. (20) Monitor shall include detailed operations and maintenance manuals to include operating, calibration and repair procedures, algorithm instructions and hardware schematics. ***The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for Line item 0001.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) intends to solicit on a competitive basis for the development of an isolation system for the mounting of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed in a 155mm artillery projectile.  The IMU will be mounted in the middle  of a bulkhead in the forward part of the projectile.  The IMU is an approximately two inch diameter, one inch high cylinder that weighs approximately 0.6 pounds with mounting tabs.  The IMU will be subjected to 15,000 g's of acceleration in the setback di rection (axial), 5,000 g's in set-forward (axial, opposite direction) and 5,000 g's balloting (radial).  The isolation solution must minimize the transfer of shock and vibrational energy above 4,000 Hz from the projectile to the IMU.  The IMU and associate d isolation system must survive only a single gun-firing.  Three prototypes will be required from successful bidder(s), with an option for up to five additional prototypes. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agen cy.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to contract with Preservation Resources, which is located at Nine S. Commerce Way, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 18017-8916, on a sole-source basis to add one new line item to the current contract number N01-LM-1-3529.  The current fixed price, indefinite delivery (indefinite quantity) type contract is for the microfilming of library materials as a means of preservation.  The current contract includes specific line items for all routine tasks.  However, occasionally there is a need for the contractor to perform a special procedure or one-time project, which is directly related to the current statement of work.  The purpose of this requirement is to allow for up to approximately 50 hours for the project manager during each of the four option years remaining under the current contract.  Preservation Resources has unique capabilities and experience in producing high contrast, continuous tone and color microfilm that meets stringent preservation requirements.  The unique capabilities and experience of the current contractor, inherent duplication of cost and effort to the government, logistical constraints, and delays in preparation which would impact the related contractor for microfilm preparation make competition for this effort unfeasible.  This notice of intent is not a Request For Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.   Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to Preservation Resources for this contract without full and open competition is planned. (See numbered notes 22 and 26.)

<DESC>This announcement replaces the announcement issued 06/24/2002 for solicitation # AB133F-02-RP-0097.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number # AB133F-02-RP-0097 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17. This procurement action is full and open.

Introduction: The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) plans to map seafloor habitat in the northern half of the Sanctuary using side scan sonar (SSS) to create digital mosaic images of the seafloor for habitat characterization purposes.  This scope of work (SOW) addresses two program elements:  (1) an OCNMS element for the provision of a vessel, captain and crew and side scan sonar fish(es) and associated equipment and staff for operating in depths of 100 to 400 m, and (2)  side scan sonar fish and associated equipment and one technician for operating in depths of  <50 m off the RV Tatoosh, a 38 foot vessel owned and operated by OCNMS.  The RV Tatoosh is equipped with an A-frame, hydraulic winch, davit and an 1800 watt AC invertor.  The side scan sonar survey is being conducted to support seafloor mapping as further described in this solicitation.  Contractors can bid on the one or both elements in this package: nearshore and offshore side scan.  The costs for each element should be presented as separate cost items.

The duration for element (1) is for 5 to 10 continuous days for 24-hr per day operations between 1 July and 30 September 2002.  The duration for element (2) is for 5 to 10 days of 12-hr per day operations from 15 to 26 July 2002.   The contractor responsibilities are listed below.  
Project Area:  For program element (1) the project concentrates on the area between 124?57'W to 125?20'W and between 48?03N to 48?20N in the waters of OCNMS (Figure 1).  For program element (2) the project concentrates on the area between 124?44'W to 124?52'W and between 47?55N to 48?09 (Figure 1).  These project areas are approximate and some minor changes may be made by OCNMS during the survey.

Program Element (1) Scope of Work 


Program element (1) will be between 5 and 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. A port day can be added but is not considered as one of the 5 to 10 continuous days. Mobilization and demobilization days, as well as transit time to and from the Sanctuary are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 1 July and 30 September 2002. The dates and length of the cruise will be set at the time the contract is awarded. Loading of contractor equipment at location of contractors choice; however, contractor shall plan for OCNMS staging (mobilizing) in Port Angeles, WA or Neah Bay, WA.  In Port Angeles this can be arranged by contacting the US Coast Guard and City of Port Angeles for access to the city pier.  Demobilization can occur in either Port Angeles or Neah Bay, WA and will be set at the time the contract is awarded.  Note:  OCNMS does not expect to have much gear to mobilize, mainly staff and computers.

Bids packages for Program Element (1) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

Vessel:  The contractor shall supply a vessel, with crew, of sufficient size/tonnage to operate 24 hrs/day, for the length of the cruise, up to 40 nm off the Washington Coast. The minimum vessel length is 80 ft.  The vessel must have appropriate deck equipment (winches, metering device, A-frames, davits, etc.) & operators to deploy and operate the side scan and associated equipment. The vessel must also accommodate up to 3 OCNMS personnel with berthing, shower & head.  The vessel shall provide meals. The vessel shall be equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS).

For this element two potential boats follow; however the contractor should not feel obligated to use these vessels.  Both have operations ongoing in the Sanctuary; therefore, mobilization and demobilization costs may be saved by using them.

Side Scan Data Acquisition System:  The contractor shall provide a SSS system to collect digital SSS imagery for mosaicing.  An appropriate tow fish shall be used to maximize resolution between 200-300m depth but capable of mapping depths of 100-400m depths.  The digital side scan sonar data shall be geocoded using the tow fish position.  The tow fish geographic position (GP) shall be calculated using the DGPS system and a Sonadyne, Track Point II, or comparable USBL system.  Cable out should be recorded on a common time base.

Digital SSS Data Format: The contractor shall provide the digital SSS data in a format readable by CARIS HIPS (version 5.2) by Universal Systems LTD, phone (506) 458-8533, however logging to Triton-Isis (XTF) is desirable.  Information and specifications on CARIS SIPS and data formats may be obtained from Universal Systems LTD.  Positioning shall be NAD83/WGS84 coordinate system.  Greenwich Mean Time shall be used for all aspects of data collection.  Data shall be delivered on CD media. 

Operations: 
1.	Accuracy ? The side scan sonar system shall be operated in such a manner that it is capable of detecting and recording vertical differences in the seabed of 15 cm and 20 cm horizontal differences in an across track orientation.
2.		Range Scale ? The achievable horizontal range scale of a side scan sonar is a function of several parameters.  Among these are sonar conditions, seabed composition, range scale in use, side scan sonar system characteristics, and tow fish height.  Actual conditions in the survey area will determine the effective range of a particular side scan sonar system.  If the effective range scale of the side scan sonar is reduced due to external factors, then the acceptable swath coverage should be reduced accordingly. The SSS shall be primarily operated on the 200-meter range scale but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative.  
3.		Line Spacing ? Line survey lines shall be oriented parallel to each other and be spaced at a distance 50% of the effective range scale apart.    
4.		Survey Speed ?The pulse repetition rate (PRR) determines the speed at which the transducer (i.e. the vessel) can move along the track and still maintain the required along track coverage of the bottom.  Longer-range scales have slower PRR which require slower vessel speeds.  The side scan shall be towed at a speed such that an object 0.5 m3 on the seafloor would be independently ensonified a minimum of three times per pass.  The maximum vessel speed for three ensonifications can be calculated as follows:  Maximum vessel speed (m/s) = target size (m) x prr/3 (sec-1).
5.		Tow fish Height ? The side scan tow fish shall be towed at a height above the bottom between 8% and 15% of the range scale in use.  For tow fish heights below the 8% of the range scale in use the effective scanning range is defined as 12.5 times the tow fish height, provided adequate echoes have been received.
6.		Confidence Checks - Confidence checks of the side scan sonar system shall be conducted at least once daily.  These checks should be accomplished at the outer limits (~85%) of the range scale being used.  Each sonar channel (i.e., port and starboard channels) shall be checked to verify proper system tuning and operation.  Confidence checks can be made on any discrete object, offshore structure, or bottom feature that is convenient to the survey area.  Targets can include wrecks, rocks, navigation buoy moorings, distinct trawl scours, or sand ripples.



Communications: Because the scientific staff may need to communicate with other research vessels, commercial vessels, & shore based facilities, the Chief Scientist or designee shall have access to use of radio transceivers & other available communication equipment.
Mechanical Breakdown: The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment & vessels in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the vessel or SSS equipment that is >12 hrs, the vessel & SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing a vessel and/or SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Fuel & Water: The contractor is responsible for providing all fuel needed to perform the contract. Any breaks from contract work to take fuel or water will be considered time off charter, for billing purposes.

Program Element (2) Scope of Work 

Program element (2) consists of the contractor providing side scan tow fish and associated equipment, cable and navigation system to support conducting side scan sonar operations off the RV Tatoosh.  This survey will be 5 to 10 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS. Mobilization and demobilization will occur in Neah Bay, WA.  Mobilization and demobilization days are in addition to the 5 to 10 continuous days of operation within the Sanctuary. Vessel operations will be conducted 12 hrs/day.  The survey shall be completed between 15 to 26 July 2002.  OCNMS will provide lodging in Neah Bay; however, the contractor will include other travel expenses.  

Bid packages for Program Element (2) should be based on the 5-day survey plus mobilization, demobilization, and transit time, with a daily rate for each additional survey day up to 10 days.

Side Scan Data Acquisition System, Digital Data Format and Operations: The SSS requirements follow those as stated under Program Element (1), except that the tow fish shall be primarily operated on the 50-meter range scale (but may change at the discretion of the OCNMS or designated representative), and positioning of the fish may be accomplished using algebraic calculations or similar algorithms taking into account measured cable out, water depth, fish height and cable cantenary.  

Mechanical Breakdown:  The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.  If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the SSS equipment that is >6 hrs, the SSS equipment shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.  The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing SSS equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Items Common to Both Program Elements

Reports & Documentation ? The contractor shall record & maintain a record throughout the cruise. Information on daily operations, problems encountered, weather and sea conditions and operational milestones shall be recorded.  The contractor shall record digitally the geographic position of the vessel throughout the cruise with positions logged every minute. Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates & recorded to accuracy equivalent to the 5th decimal place using decimal degrees. A digital track line file in ASCII format shall be provided to OCNMS at the completion of the project. All times shall be recorded in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

The contractor shall provide a descriptive report of the survey operations.  The report shall contain but not be limited to all data necessary to complete office processing of the survey data, environmental conditions encountered that may have a bearing on data quality or accuracy, methods used and circumstances encountered during data acquisition.  The report also serves to index all applicable data and associated records.  The following is a general outline to be followed:

Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Cui Guanglei, Director & Vice President, China Petrochemical International Co., Ltd. Building C, Anli Garden, No. 66 Anli St., Chaoyang District, Beijing 100101, CHINA Phone:  86-10-6490-7877, Fax: 86-10-6421-6972  :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would define the technical and financial requirements of an e-procurement system for Sinopec International, China's leading trading company. The two goals of the feasibility study would be to determine (a) how Sinopec International should invest, organize its business, and train its staff to implement the e-procurement system and (b) what type of e-procurement system the firm should implement.  

Sinopec International is responsible for import and export activities related to Sinopec, its parent company, and handles the largest trade volume of any Chinese entity ($12.2 billion in 2000, reflecting $11 billion in imports and $1.2 billion in exports). With China?s accession into the WTO and the implementation of China?s 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), demand for crude oil and petrochemical products now outpaces domestic supply.  Consequently, China will likely have to follow measures to conserve oil, find fuel substitutes, accelerate exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas resources, and make effective use of overseas resources.

Given these circumstances, Sinopec International plans to acquire as much technology as possible through technical exchanges with their foreign counterparts, as well as accelerate procurement of conventional equipment and services for the petroleum and petrochemical industry, heavy vehicles for transportation, telecommunications infrastructure, iron & steel piping, instrumentation, chemical products and advanced gas sales systems.  To facilitate its procurement activities, Sinopec International plans to establish its own e-procurement platform.

The tasks that would be completed for the feasibility study by the U.S. firm include: (1) Recommendation for a Strategic Investment and Management Plan; (2) Recommendation for Technical Implementation; (3) Strategic Investment Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (4) Technical Specifications Plan for Sinopec International?s E-Procurement System; (5) Organizational Staff Development and Training Needs and Plans; (6) Legal Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; (7) Cultural Concerns for E-Procurement Systems; and (8) Financial Plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $429,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, August 5, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging intelligent agent technology capable of automating the mobility and deployment processes of an entire Air Force Wing.  An Air Force Wing has approximately 1000 to 5000 people and includes the primary mission operations group and the necessary supporting organizations such as logistics, maintenance, supply, transportation, contracting, civil engineering, security forces, communications, medical, and services.  The technology must be windows and web-based and capable of being installed on a standard PC or laptop computer.  The software will need a stand-alone capability and possess the ability to linkup and collect all required mobility related information from existing Air Force deployment and personnel systems such as but not limited to MILMOD (Military Modernization), LOGMOD (Logistics Modernization), and MANPER (Manpower/Personnel) databases.  It must have modifiable business rules making it capable of adapting to changing policies.  The software needs to be developed as an open system architecture and accepted professional and commercial conventions for interoperability.   It must be able to understand unique user requirements, recognize its own data limitations, and possess the capability to collect and fuse additional information, and present it to the user in proper format with minimal or no user interface.  The system must provide multiple users the capability to query both unit specific data and a wings overall deployment information.  The system needs to identify all components required to support both large and single personnel deployments.  Once identified, the system must alert all supporting agencies of the requirements along with timelines, materials, and equipment needed.  Information security is a mandatory requirement that must be incorporated throughout the system.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. Submission Deadline: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 12 July 2002. Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Mike Geyser, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, (703) 491-8234, geyserm@ctc.com, 100 CTC drive Johnstown, PA, 15904 (703) 491-8234 geyserm@ctc.com Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged. General BAA Information: this notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the intelligent architecture demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Air Force to pay any prototype costs related to this announcement. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT ONLY THE AIR MOBILITY COMMAND IS LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO THE OBLIGATION OF FUNDS.

<DESC>Sources are sought in sustaining engineering by the F-16 Management Directorate, Products Division (OO-ALC/YPV) to develop and demonstrate high speed data communications technology for legacy Mil-Std-1553B data bus cable plants. The technology will be common and applicable to the F-16 aircraft platform including avionics and munitions. The legacy technologies include line replaceable unit (LRU) interface, Mil-Std-1553B matrices and data link electronics. This high speed technology will enable lower integration cost, faster fielding of systems, in field upgrading of systems and longer system life. Requirements:  Backward compatibility to support legacy hardware and its associated input/output (I/O), i.e., the Mil-Std-1553B data bus while enhancing performance by providing a High-speed Data Bus on the existing data bus and simultanously performing data transfer without disturbing the performance of the existing 1553 data path.  Throughput rates of a minimum of 200 Megabit/sec at a maximum data error rate of 1^-12 is required concurrently with Mil-Std-1553B  one Megabit/sec data on the same Mil-Std 1553 cable. This capability will be required to be ready for demonstration two weeks after contract award using three hundred feet of 1553 cable and at least two Mil-Std-1553 couplers.  The capability to demonstrate 200Megabit/sec in a Software Integration Laboratory (SIL) environment within 3 months will also be required.  We are interested in demonstrations of a high-speed data bus that can support avionics and weapons functions and the expected high throughput requirements of the F-16 aircraft.  Additional information:  Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electromagnetic Interference (EMC/EMI) accommodations - Deterministic bus access protocol to support critical avionics and weapons delivery functions ? Eventual implementation of a widely available bus standard - High-speed physical layer medium - Supports transport of critical and non-critical data on the same physical bus - Low power consumption - Rapid fault recovery capabilities - Built-In-Test and diagnostics.

Payoffs include: a) reduced weapon platform integration costs, b) backward compatible/forward configurable avionics/weapon platform interfaces and c) common avionics, dispenser and munitions interfaces.

 This program will last approximately 12 months. The effort will begin with a demonstration/study phase to show operability and feasibility. The feasibility of a common I/O card will be determined by studies. Preliminary design concepts for retrofit kits will be created next. The preliminary design will be followed by detail design, fabrication, and testing of prototype electronics. The prototype electronics shall be configured for backward compatibility to legacy systems and forward configurability for future systems. Firms having applicable interests, capability and background should submit particulars in accordance with Numbered Note 25 to POC listed below.  Firms will be evaluated on their experience, personnel, facilities and supporting simulations and modeling. Responses to this synopsis must be received within 15 days from date of the synopsis publication. Respondents to this notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or a small disadvantaged business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 541710, 500 employees. The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine or administrative questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Program Manager. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentially as to the source of the concern. Potential offerors are invited to contact the Ombudsman listed below with serious concerns only.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Naval Shipyard Annex Portsmouth, Virginia is seeking expressions of interest to determine if there are an adequate number of responsible and interested sources who can meet a forthcoming competitive requirement for disposition of a radioactive shielding tank.  The tank may be disassembled and recycled or macroencapsulated and disposed.  The tank is considered recyclable material in accordance with 40 CFR 261.  Tank size is approximately 13 feet in diameter by 17 feet high, weighing 260,000 pounds, including the shipping container.  Tank walls are carbon steel with attached lead and polyethylene.  

If the tank is recycled, the recycled lead and steel is to be reused by DOE, Navy, and/or commercial nuclear applications in accordance with the Department of Energy memorandum dated July 13, 2000, concerning the release of radioactive surplus and scrap metals into commerce.  Much of the reusable steel is less than 2000 pCi/gm, and the majority of the lead will be uncontaminated following removal of activated tinning.  It is expected that, at a minimum, some of the steel will have to be disposed of as radioactive material and a small amount of radioactive lead will have to be disposed of as mixed waste in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 268.  If the tank is macroencapsulated and disposed, adherence to a regulator-approved macroencapsulation procedure and applicable provisions of 40 CFR 268 is required.

Radiation levels inside the tank are less than 1 R/hr.  The tank contains PCB paint (>500 ppm) on outer surfaces, therefore processing must take place at a facility with a PCB commercial storers permit.  The tank will be shipped by rail to the recycling or macroencapsulation location in the 2004-2005 timeframe.

A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical resources, a good performance record in the radioactive metals industry, possess a facility security clearance for handling confidential restricted data and material and must satisfy foreign ownership requirements for work on classified components.  A respondent to this market survey should have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to disassemble or macroencapsulate this item.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, physical, personnel, security etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.  Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above proposed requirements should submit to FISC NNSY Annex a two (2) page (maximum) typed expression of interest/capability statement indicating ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above.  Vendor information of particular interest includes, but is not limited to, information on the physical facility, processing capability, relevant permits and licenses, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, past experience, and any relevant special or unique features of the company, location or facility.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail, or facsimile will be accepted.  The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.  All data will be for official Government use only.  The Government will not provide the data received from one responder to other potentially competitive organizations.  A list of interested parties will be complied from the firms who respond to this announcement.  This sources sought announcement is for informational and planning purposes only; it does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ), or a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Companies that are interested in this requirement and believe they are capable of performing this requirement are asked to submit the information outlined above to the point of contact listed above to:  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk Naval Shipyard Annex, C531.4E, Portsmouth, Virginia 23709-5000,:  Company name and address, business size, cage code, POC, business number and fax number and the POC;s e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>Natural Gas Transportation Agreement for Bush Dome Helium    Storage Reservoir
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) seeks to enter a natural gas    transportation agreement for Federal natural gas assets.  The gas will    be available at either the tailgate of a new Cliffside Helium Extraction    Unit (CHEU) or anywhere along a 10-inch pipeline operated by BLM that    runs from the CHEU to a point approximately 19 miles north of the CHEU.    The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from    the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and    separate the products at the CHEU, which is currently under construction    with a planned completion date of February 2003. The BLM estimates that    the Federal natural gas volumes from CHEU will average 12,000 to 25,000    MMBtu/day and will remain relatively steady through the 12 to 15 year    life of this project. The U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) will    market the natural gas as a component of its Royalty in Kind program.    Accordingly, the BLM and MMS desire offers for firm and/or interruptible    transportation service to the first transparent pricing point, where the    MMS will market this gas using index-based pricing on seasonal terms.    The selection of a firm for this project will be based in part on the    ability to deliver to strong markets and the relationships to competing    pipelines. The firm selected for the agreement must finance and    construct necessary facilities to connect to BLM infrastructure. The    Invitation for Offers and other operational details of the project (e.g.    maps, CHEU tailgate pressure, gas quality, etc.) are available upon    request. Interested parties are encouraged to contact Mr. Tim Spisak of    the BLM at 806-324-2602 for questions regarding the CHEU, or Mr. Mike    Deberard of MMS at 303-231-3884 for questions about natural gas sales.    Responses of interest to this announcement must be made no later than    June 28, 2002.
