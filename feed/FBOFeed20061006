<DESC>Responses to this announcement are sought to investigate the feasibility and practicability of improving upon and demonstrating the M2C2 (Mobile Modular Command and Control) payload previously developed and demonstrated under BAA 04-001, FY 04 Long Range Navy and Marine Corps Science and Technology Program. 

It is the intent of this research effort to explore and investigate innovative concepts based on new and existing technologies that can be adapted and integrated into the M2C2 prototype to deliver leading edge capabilities that will allow ONR to help the Marine Corps further define its emerging C2 On-The-Move concept. The research objective includes achieving objective performance and capability parameters. The effort will also involve consideration and development of the technologies that will enhance the capabilities of the Combat Operations Center (COC) and Combined Army Marine Command and Control Vehicle (CAMC2V) programs.

A mobile integration testbed will be implemented at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay, HI for demonstrating candidate technologies and for data gathering to support technology evaluation and assessment. This testbed will serve as a technology incubator for testing and demonstrating novel approaches and innovative application of technologies to ultimately provide an enhanced M2C2 prototype.   There are two existing Phase I prototypes, one of which will be available as a technology integration testbed at MCBH Kaneohe Bay.  It is the intent of the Government to make award(s) in response to this BAA solicitation in two research areas: (1) Prototype Integration, Technology Insertion and Demonstration and (2) Enabling Technology Development.

<DESC>1. The 15 Contracting Squadron/LGCZ has the requirement to obtain support services for the Kenney Headquarters (KHQ)Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC)Air Mobility Division (AMD). This is a recompetition of the former Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) contract.  The Kenney Headquarters Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC) Air Mobility Division (AMD) is Commander PACAF’s executive agent primarily responsible for Command and Control of PACAF and other (as specified) air mobility aircraft operating within the USPACOM AOR – both in peacetime and in crisis.  The PAOC AMD operates twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, including weekends and holidays. On a steady-state basis, the PAOC AMD oversees a variety of air mobility missions operating within an ever-changing scenario of theater environments, exercises, and day-to-day operations.  Primary AMD functions include planning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, flight following, dispatching, and recovering PACAF assigned and gained air mobility aircraft.  In a theater crisis, the PAOC AMD continues to support steady-state operations while simultaneously mobilizing select ‘core’ AMD functionalities to focus on the urgency at-hand.  In such instances, the AMD integrates with global air mobility systems to enable a rapid and responsive transition from peacetime to contingency operations to efficiently and effectively accomplish the AMD mission in providing seamless global mobility.   

In addition to a small government contingent consisting of the AMD Chief, AMD Deputy, Senior Directors, Quality Assurance Personnel, Airlift Requirements, the Pacific Military Altitude Reservation Facility (PACMARF), and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Cell personnel, the PAOC AMD is predominately made up of contract mission managers, dispatchers, airlift and tanker planners, operational support airlift schedulers, DV planners, logisticians, and internal staff support. 

A Statement of Work was posted on FedBizOps earlier. The NAICS code being used is 488190.  The RFP is scheduled to be issued NLT 16 Jun 06 with a closing date of 14 Jul 06.  Oral Presentations are estimated to begin about 19 Jul 06.

<SOLNBR>FA8771-06-R-0017
<RESPDATE>111406
<ARCHDATE>12112006
<CONTACT>Harry Bryan, Contract Specialist, 334-416-2459, Dianne C. (Chrissy) Ohlandt, Contracting Officer, 334-416-6217
<DESC>This is a formal announcement of intent to award a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition to loosely couple Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning Segments (DCAPES) from the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) on an expedited basis while migrating DCAPES from Global Command and Control System-Joint/Air Force (GCCS-J/AF) Client Server Architecture (CSA) to Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) Net-Centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  DCAPES is a National Security System and Air Force System of Record to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute Combat Air Power.  It is used by HQ USAF, Major Commands, Numbered Air Forces, Air Components of Unified Commands, Field Operating Agencies, Direct Reporting Units, Air Force Reserves, and Air National Guard to annually deploy over 69,000 airmen to 64 countries.  The Air Force's 554th Electronic Systems Wing intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for fielding DCAPES releases that are aligned with JOPES releases 4.1 and 4.2, sustaining fielded DCAPES configurations (including Tier II Help Desk and training support), providing new capabilities where warranted by high priority warfighter requirements or efficiencies of development, and providing transition support to insure stability during any learning curve phase of the follow-on, competitively awarded DCAPES Increment 2b effort.  DCAPES is currently tightly coupled with JOPES on the security, database and application levels.  Each JOPES release requires assessment of impacts to DCAPES and frequently requires changes to the DCAPES software.  Each JOPES release creates the potential for loss of DCAPES  operational capability due to the tight coupling.  The recently accelerated JOPES migration schedule requires evaluation of JOPES engineering drops as early as Mar 2007.  Because of the interdependencies with other programs and initiatives, the DCAPES spiral implementation effort will require synchronization with the roll-out plans of Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC), Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J), Global Command and Control System - Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (GCCS-JOPES), Global Command and Control System - Air Force Infrastructure (GCCS-AF (I)), GCSS-AF, and War Planning and Execution System (WPES) Family of Systems (FoS).  It is estimated this loose coupling and Net-Centric SOA migration will be complete by December 2008.  The DCAPES Increment 2b development will be deferred until loose  coupling is achieved by fielding DCAPES aligned with JOPES release 4.2.  The proposed contract action is for technical requirements and integrated logistics support and sustainment for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Only CSC has the detailed technical knowledge of DCAPES architecture, tight coupling with JOPES, complex interfaces with Command & Control and Combat Support information systems, embedded War Planning & Execution decision rules, and DISA Net-Centric SOA plans to be able to assess impacts of JOPES changes and design/code necessary changes into DCAPES to meet the JOPES accelerated migration schedule.  Competition and potential transition to a new contractor that does  not have CSC's expertise in the DCAPES system prior to JOPES release 4.2 completed migration to Net-Centric SOA is likely to result in an unacceptable delay, increased risk and increased cost to the Government.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within the next 10 days.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received within 45 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Air Force.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the Government's discretion.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The government will not reimburse any costs associated with providing any  information associated with this announcement.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541511.  Indicate in your response whether you are a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, (8)a concern, woman-owned small business, HUB-zone small business, veteran owned small business, or service disabled veteran owned small business.  Also, specify in your response whether you are a U.S. owned or foreign owned firm.  Responses can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Dianne C. (Chrissy) Ohlandt, 490 East Moore Drive, Bldg 892, Suite 270, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114 or you may submit a fax response to (334) 416-3035.

4.   Small Business Goals and Objectives
5.   Requirements Briefing

USTRANSCOM will host subsequent one-on-one sessions with potential offerors to provide them an opportunity to address any specific areas of concern in regards to the release of the final AT21 solicitation.  The one-on-one sessions will not be a forum to market company specific capabilities or for vendors to obtain information that has not been shared with industry. Sessions will be strictly limited to 30 minutes and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis.

The one-on-one sessions will be held 01-03 November 2006 at the The MITRE Corporation, Lakepointe Centre Professional Park, 1662 Windham Way, O?Fallon, IL  62269.  To schedule a one-on-one session, please e-mail your company name and point of contact information to Ms. Terri Francoeur at terri.francoeur@ustranscom.mil and Michael Pardue at michael.pardue@ustranscom.mil no later than 25 Oct 2006.  Specific questions can be directed to Ms. Francoeur and Mr. Pardue at 618-256-4300. Due to space limitations, a maximum of ten company (10) representatives will be allowed to participate. Please note that your participation in the one-on-one sessions will be at your company's expense. USTRANSCOM will not provide any reimbursement for costs incurred in travel or other expenses. Further, the government may use any information provided during the one-on-one sessions to complete market research. We highly recommend you not discuss any information you deem as competitive sensitive or proprietary. If you choose to provide written documentation to support your discussion, recommend you identify all sensitive information, such as corporate proprietary information, and state the appropriate restrictions in the evaluation and use of the information provided.  USTRANSCOM appreciates your participation in this acquisition.

The following is a brief synopsis of the AT21 requirement:  

Agile Transportation for the 21st Century will identify and implement business processes and systems that enable USTRANSCOM?s distribution planning, transportation planning, and transportation execution activities in support of the DOD distribution enterprise. This effort will apply best business practices and leverage order management and transportation management technologies; enhance supply chain capabilities resulting in reduced deployment and distribution cycle times, increased customer satisfaction via tailored distribution support, and reduced customer wait time; and, achieve of an environment that provides asset visibility throughout the supply chain and leads to decreased materiel costs.

The effort will focus less on capturing the ?as-is? processes and more on providing a solution ?blueprint? that best meets the program objectives (mission capability and performance), addressing and integrating the myriad of enterprise-wide elements including: organization, culture, personnel competency, business processes, facilities and assets, and enabling information technology. The ultimate solution should define and enable end-to-end integrated processes to achieve transformational impact, rather than applying technology to existing processes for incremental improvement. 

This requirement will be managed in increments as shown below.  Initiation of each increment is not necessarily dependent on the completion of the previous increment.  

Increment	Description
I	Requirements Consolidation and Workflow Management
II	Strategic-Level Optimization and Scheduling
III	Operational-Level Optimization and Scheduling
Post Incr III	Post Increment 3 Support

Specific AT21 requirements will be identified in the Capability Development Document (CDD) and in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation expected to be released the week of October 16, 206.

ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitati!  on will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you ga!  ther information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not t he official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause.

For LPD 18, efforts will include eight week FOA in FY07 to complete system installations and capabilities that were not part of the basic construction and that are necessary to support ship Post Delivery Test & Trial (PDT&T).  PSA of up to 12 weeks will follow in FY08.  For LPD 20, efforts will include six week FOA in FY08 followed by a PSA of up to 12 weeks in FY09.  FOA/PSA efforts include all manpower, support services, material, and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish these availabilities.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible deficiencies, installation of approved engineeri!  ng changes (that were not incorporated during the construction period) and new work identified between ship delivery and the start of FOA/PSA.  Efforts will include engineering and management support of FOA/PSA, testing and post repair sea trials, and other emergent work.  The proposed contract will include scope to allow for emergent availabilities to correct Government responsible deficiencies identified after delivery that must be corrected to support test & trials prior to the start of the FOA/PSA.  During FOA/PSA, the ships will be made available for completion of fleet funded repairs and changes.  Work on these two vessels will take place in the homeport area of San Diego, California.  The solicitation, and any resulting contract, will require offerors to allow third party access to the ships for the Government Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and the building yard.  A responsible offer will be considered eligible if the offeror has previously executed a master agre!  ement for repairs and alterations of vessels or is a ship repair firm  that can demonstrate those qualifications.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.

A !  firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.  Commercial procedures will not be used.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the continuation of the existing Independent Program Assessment Contract (IPAC). The IPAC contract performs independent systems evaluation and integration assessments for NASA. Independent assessment requirements include cost, schedule, and technical risk assessments which include aspects of safety and mission assurance. These assessments include non-advocate reviews for NASA program and projects, assessments in support of critical development milestones; readiness review assessments, program reviews assessments, assessment in support of operational programs and projects, and institutional and tool development and use assessments.  The purpose of this extension to the period of performance is to provide NASA/JSC with the necessary support while a review of the assessment needs of the Constellation Program is performed. This action is necessary to ensure the follow-on contract for independent assessments can support NASA’s new program. The extension to the existing contract will be for a six month period with no increase in contract value. NASA/JSC intends to contract with Booz Allen Hamilton on a sole source basis for the extension. Booz Allen Hamilton is the current contractor on the IPAC contract.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may respond in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Monday October 16, 2006.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

     Managua International Airport Modernization Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Managua International Airport Modernization Project.

Since 2001, Central America and Mexican leadership have embarked on a very important regional development program know as the Plan-Puebla-Panama. This program establishes a framework for the development of specific sectors, with special emphasis on transportation infrastructure, as the most important means to increase trade and reduce poverty. One of the priorities of the Plan-Puebla-Panama is the development of the air cargo facilities in the Central American region as a vital component of a consolidated, multimodal system encompassing airports, ports, railroads and roads. 

With expectations of increased demand of commercial transportation under the U.S. - Central America Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), Nicaragua's International Airport Administration is planning for the future. They have requested a feasibility study to 1) assess the key modernization components of expansion of an air cargo facility at the Managua International Airport, 2) a new runway lighting system and 3) a domestic and international security plan.

Air Cargo Facility

In preparation for the expected increase in air cargo resulting from Nicaragua's participation in CAFTA-DR, the Managua International Airport is in need of an expanded cargo facility to accommodate the projected increase in demand. The development of this new terminal is a key priority for the Empresa Administradora de Aeropuertos Internacionales (EAAI) , as recent infrastructure investments have concentrated on accommodating increases in passenger traffic, and have not kept pace with increases in international cargo volumes averaging 5% growth per year since 1997.  It is predicted that improvement of the existing facilities would result in significant increases in cargo movements for the airport. EAAI has requested that the feasibility study include the design of a modular air cargo handling facility capable of handling 60,000 tons of cargo, an area with refrigerated storage, and a dedicated platform capable of parking three wide body aircraft and the corresponding connecting taxiway to the main runway.

Runway Lighting System
To complement the runway expansion project currently underway, EAAI would like to establish a conceptual framework for the future implementation of a new, modern runway lighting system.  This upgrade is necessary not only to introduce current technology, but also because the existing system requires the utilization of excessive resources, and therefore results in high maintenance costs.  

Security System
As part of the overall modernization process, the entire Managua International Airport is in need of a security system that meets the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) and that helps Nicaragua obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Category I classification.  Although there have been several upgrades to the security system at the existing airport, there is a need to consider an integrated security master plan that will assess the current status of the entire airport property and propose the implementation steps to bring the entire airport facility to full compliance with the requirements of ICAO and the FAA for the transportation of passengers and cargo.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $324,180 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit one (1) original version of their proposal in English and one (1) copy and one (1) version in Spanish and six (6) copies in Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME on Monday, November 13, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

CONTRACT SCOPE:  The supplies covered by this contract are spare or replacement parts which are to be manufactured by business firms included on a Qualified Manufacturers List IAW DFARS Subpart 209.2--Qualifications Requirements.  14 NSNs are included in this grouping (see listing of NSNs below).

While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.  The initial 14 NSNs are listed below.  Additional NSNs within the scope of this initiative may be added to any resultant contract at a later date using the Add / Delete Clause H15D01 and are subject to synopsis in the CBD.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. The 15 Contracting Squadron/LGCZ has the requirement to obtain support services for the Kenney Headquarters (KHQ)Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC)Air Mobility Division (AMD). This is a recompetition of the former Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) contract.  The Kenney Headquarters Pacific Air Operations Center (PAOC) Air Mobility Division (AMD) is Commander PACAF’s executive agent primarily responsible for Command and Control of PACAF and other (as specified) air mobility aircraft operating within the USPACOM AOR – both in peacetime and in crisis.  The PAOC AMD operates twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, including weekends and holidays. On a steady-state basis, the PAOC AMD oversees a variety of air mobility missions operating within an ever-changing scenario of theater environments, exercises, and day-to-day operations.  Primary AMD functions include planning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, flight following, dispatching, and recovering PACAF assigned and gained air mobility aircraft.  In a theater crisis, the PAOC AMD continues to support steady-state operations while simultaneously mobilizing select ‘core’ AMD functionalities to focus on the urgency at-hand.  In such instances, the AMD integrates with global air mobility systems to enable a rapid and responsive transition from peacetime to contingency operations to efficiently and effectively accomplish the AMD mission in providing seamless global mobility.   

In addition to a small government contingent consisting of the AMD Chief, AMD Deputy, Senior Directors, Quality Assurance Personnel, Airlift Requirements, the Pacific Military Altitude Reservation Facility (PACMARF), and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Cell personnel, the PAOC AMD is predominately made up of contract mission managers, dispatchers, airlift and tanker planners, operational support airlift schedulers, DV planners, logisticians, and internal staff support. 

A Statement of Work was posted on FedBizOps earlier. The NAICS code being used is 488190.  The RFP will be issued 12 Jul 06 with a closing date of 04 Aug 06.  Oral Presentations are estimated to begin about 07 Aug 06.

<DESC>Below are answers to questions received by Robin Wong (GSA) prior to October 6, 2006.

1. The modification posted Sept. 12, 2006 identifies a change in Point of Contact to Gregory McSweeny, yet the latest posting still refers to Lilia West as the Point of Contact. Which is the correct contact for sending our submittal?
All submittals should be sent to the attention of Mr. Gregory McSweeny. Please send submittals to the following address:
General Services Administration
Property Development Division
Attn: Mr. Gregory McSweeny
450 Golden Gate Ave., 3rd Floor West
San Francisco, CA 94102

Please be advised that Ms. Lilia West is no longer the Point of Contact for this project, contrary to what is stated at the foot of each posting. Please direct all questions or concerns via e-mail to Ms. Robin Wong at robin.wong@gsa.gov 

2. In the Responses to Non-technical Questions (posted Sept. 20, 2006), Question 6 states that projects submitted for the Past Performance requirement must be complete and dated within the last 10 years (clearly excluding work presently under construction and pre-construction). Does the same criterion apply for the projects submitted as part of the Lead Designer Portfolio (i.e. only projects COMPLETED during the last 10 years)?
As stated in the original Synopsis: If the Lead Designer is "a single designer, submit a Portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). If the Lead Designer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each Lead Designer or Lead Design Discipline." Completed projects, for the interest of the Lead Designer Portfolio, include projects where the design is complete. 

3. Will the Small Business Outreach meeting with the short-listed firms be on November 7th, location TBA, or October 26th like it says on FedBizOpps?  
The Small Business Outreach is currently scheduled for November 7th, 2006 (subject to change), location and time TBA.  Please continue checking FedBizOpps for updated information regarding the date, time, and place for this event.

4.  This question is in reference to a slide contained in the Powerpoint Presentation displayed at the Pre-submittal Conference. The slide read:

* Office = 470,000 gsf 
* Parking = 510 cars 

Is this a ballpark estimate of the project program (new and existing)?  Please confirm.
Yes, the above is a ballpark estimate of the project program (new and existing) and is subject to change. Please be reminded that the Powerpoint presentation, as well as other materials presented at the Pre-submittal Conference, were posted on FedBizOpps on Sept. 20, 2006.

5.  In the Stage I submittal, can the Lead Designer (team) consist of 2 firms (architectural) to show a combination of projects? If yes, do we need to identify that they are 2 firms in the stage one submittal, or would we identify that in the Stage II submittal?
As stated in the original Synopsis, the A/E firm may include a partnership of 2 firms. However, the Lead Designer must be an individual, pair, or group that will lead the design for this project. Any declaration of a partnership should be made in Stage I. Please refer to the original Synopsis for more details.

6. Who is conducting a Program Development Study (PDS) for this project?
At the Pre-submittal Conference held on Sept. 14, 2006 in San Diego, GSA indicated that Louis Berger Group and Performa, Inc. were performing the PDS for this project. No further information regarding the PDS or PDS contractor will be released at this time. The information generated by the PDS contractor will be forwarded to the short-listed firms in Stage II.

Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining the feasibility of conducting this acquisition.  Responses will be reviewed for their viability.  The determination of acquisition strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All sources are encouraged to submit a response, which will be considered by the Government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit comments from stakeholders regarding the acquisition approach and the extent to which industry can meet the Government?s requirements.
We invite comments/information on the following:
-	A respondent's capability to meet the requirements as drafted in the previous paragraphs.  
-	Whether the products and services are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule, GWAC, etc.). 
-	Whether the products and services are currently available on the open market, or what agreements would need to be established to provide the service.
-	Estimated pricing and explanation of pricing structure(s) for services.  The Government requests pricing for a base period of one calendar year and four option years, which may be exercised based upon the Government?s continuing need, past performance and funding availability.
-	Client references of other Government Agency POC's with experience procuring similar services, or comparable commercial applications.
-	Contractor?s and/or potential subcontractors? status as a small business, veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
-	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
-	Where stakeholders differ with the Government?s current acquisition planning, we specifically request suggested alternatives that would be equally effective in meeting the Government's objectives.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.

Question submission requirements:	All questions regarding the RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to Wendi Borrenpohl (wendi.borrenpohl@gsa.gov) and Mara Shultz (mara.shultz@gsa.gov).

What will be done with responses:	The Government intends to refine its' requirements and associated documents as appropriate, verify availability of qualified sources, based on all sources of input received, especially responses to this RFI.  The Government does not intend to respond unilaterally to individual respondents unless clarification of information submitted is required.  All contact will be through the contracting officer. 
As a result of the clarification questions received, the date for receipt of information is being extended.  The following responses are provided:  

Question #1:  Will the TV content be served from a single head end across the IP network? 

Response:  AMC has the requirement to provide commercial TV access to the base (campus) population.  The requirement is for CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Weather Channel, and two (2) local channels (to be identified for the specific Air Force Base.)  The requirement will consist of the satellite services, to include the re-broadcasting rights, and the head end equipment (satellite dish and receiver).  The service will be taken from the head end equipment and connected to the base IPTV network equipment.  The IPTV network equipment will take the signal and provide multicast service to the base population.

Question #2:  Where will the head end(s) be located?

Response:  Same location as the IPTV server equipment.

Question #3:  What IP distribution technology will be used/provided by the Air Force?   Please provide vendor, technology, network, etc.?

Response:  Manufacturer specific information is not available at this time.  It is anticipated that the equipment will consist of a decoder system, a video on demand system and a scheduling system.  Specific manufacturer information will be included in the official request for proposal.

Question #4:  What type of signal is to be delivered to the Government?s IPTV equipment (composite, Coax, etc.)?

Response:  Coax cable will be the transport media from head end equipment to IPTV Network equipment.

Question #5:  Will the TV content equipment be collocated with the IP encoding/distribution technology?

Response:    Yes.  

Question #6:  Are all of the end points traditional televisions?   Will any content need to be delivered to a computer?

Response: The majority of the end points will be computers.  It is anticipated that the traditional televisions will require the use of a device to convert the IP signal for use with the TV or Digital Display unit.  This converter will not be the responsibility of the broadcast provider.  

Question #7:  We are wondering who we should approach re the development of the content to be used in the broadcasts?  

Response:  The RFI is seeking information regarding the availability of existing broadcast television services, not the creation of content.  No development of content is anticipated to be required.  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, The Weather Channel and two local broadcast TV channels will be rebroadcast.  A critical service component to ensure the service provider has rebroadcast rights to allow up to 3000 users, per service delivery location, to view the transmission.

<DESC>The following are the Government's responses to the questions received from firms interested in this RFI:

Q1.	I was wondering if there is an incumbent who has ever performed the work expressed in this RFI.  If so, would you please provide me with Contractor's name; Contract number; Award date; Expiration date; and Value.

A1.	Based on the requestor not responding to clarification of defining ?work?, the Government can not accurately respond to this question.


Q2.	Please provide a copy of the bidders list for the RFI.

A2.	A bidder?s list for this RFI is not applicable as this is not a solicitation.  Therefore, there are no bidders.  


Q3.	We are not software developers, nor a computer firm, we are a consulting firm, how could our services be used by IRS? 

A3.	We are looking for any qualified or interested parties who can fund development and hosting of this product for themselves and if you have that capability or experience, please respond to the RFI.  
 

Q4.	It appears that the strategic partners' roles may be some what similar to how IRS works with Turbo-tax to help income tax filers submit online, is this a correct assumption?

A4.	Yes, except the plan for this collaboration is that the output of the Cyber Assistant tool is a paper application that is filed by mail with the IRS.  There is no ability to file the application on-line until the IRS is able to support this functionality.  But otherwise, your assumption is correct.  The partners would be responsible for keeping the application up to date, provide a secure hosting environment for users, or market the program as a CD or downloadable tool that provides a secure environment for users.  


 Q5.	If in fact, we market the IRS online service to clients, (we currently mail-out marketing materials to over 6,000 potential Form 1023 applicants annually, in addition to our website which get over 1,500 hits monthly) and they agree to use this service, it appears the client will get a reduced user fee as an incentive; what would my firm get as an incentive?  

A5.   	To clarify, the Cyber Assistant developer would provide a service to the applicants.  The output of the application would be a Form 1023 that could be printed and mailed to the IRS.  The IRS is considering reducing its user fee for processing applications created with the Cyber Assistant.  The incentive for the developer would be to receive the approval of the IRS for its software after it is successfully tested and piloted.   


Q6a.	Could my firm still charge the client a fee for using our service (as Turbo-tax does), even though they agree to submit the Form 1023 on line?  Or would IRS award a portion of the reduced user fee as an incentive? 

A6a.	The issue of charging the client a fee for using the Cyber Assistant is up to the developer/vendor of Cyber Assistant.  


Q6b.	Would our consultants still be permitted to complete the online form for clients who feel incompetent to do it themselves, or for those who are not computer or internet savvy? 

A6b.	Yes, the tool is designed to allow collaboration with clients and contains both the Form 2848,  Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative and the Form 8821, Tax Information Authorization, for this purpose so the applicant can grant authorization as they deem appropriate.       


Q6c.	In this process, it appears that our firm could both gain (by increased volume) and lose (not as many clients would need our services) business and revenue.  Any clarification on how this process may benefit both our firm and the applicant would be appreciated.

A6c.	The IRS has created the prototype and is seeking partners to make it their own and integrate it into their suite of products and services to assist applicants.  Material to be provided by the IRS to interested developers includes educational content that has been created and approved by the IRS.  Successful partners will receive the benefit of being able to market ?IRS approved? software.  The IRS intends to move forward and develop the ability to support electronic submission of applications in a future effort.  
	
 
Q7a.  	As a consulting firm, we provide an array of Form 1023 related services that help clients qualify and comply with the IRS 501c3 - Tax Exempt requirements: incorporations, amendments, restatements, bylaws, EIN, etc.  under the new online filing process, would Form 1023 applicants still be required to meet the same requirements and mail user fees?  

A7a.	Again, to clarify, the on-line process is using the Cyber Assistant tool, not filing Form 1023.   The tool would navigate the Form 1023 for an applicant and/or their authorized representatives.   The tool would create a paper Form 1023 that is complete and the tool would ensure that all required attachments for the IRS have been addressed.   Applicants would still be required to meet the same requirements, but the Cyber Assistant tool would assist them in understanding the filing requirements through imbedded links to IRS approved educational information.  The tool enforces completeness in filling out the application.  A user fee is still required to be submitted with the application, though the IRS is considering reducing it for Cyber Assistant users.  


Q7b.	Does this explain why some documents and the user fee would still have to be mailed to IRS?

A7b.	Refer to A7a.  


Q7c.	If some Form 1023 documents still have to be mailed to IRS, then what is the advantage of online filing of the Form 1023?

A7c.	The purpose of the tool is to assist with the completion of Form 1023; the tool will not provide online filing, which is a future enhancement.  The advantage to users is the educational information embedded in the application along with the navigation and validation routines which ensure appropriate schedules are completed, and all required input is entered.  When the IRS receives a Form 1023 prepared with the Cyber Assistant tool, it will be complete, and likely to be processed without the need for correspondence for additional information from the IRS. It may also be eligible for a reduced user fee.  


Q8.	Is it correct that there is no compensation for this program, other than a potential reduction in the User Fee associated with Form 1023?

A8.	Yes.    


Q9.	One of the requested items is financial information, which we will gladly include.  We would like clarification as to what is desired in that regard.  We can provide current financial statements, prior tax returns or a combination of both.  We want to send only what is needed.

A9	Current financial statements are satisfactory.   

Q10.	Will interested vendors be required to develop their application solely at their cost?
A10.	Yes, and vendors will be able to offer to the marketplace the approval by IRS of the application.
 
Q11. 	Will interested vendors be required to then test the application with users that they recruit to test the software?
A11.	Yes. 

Q12. 	What is the application fee ($) that interested vendors are required to submit?
A12.	There is no application fee to participate in the development and testing of the Cyber Assistant tool.  The fee refers to the user fee that applicants for a determination letter are required to submit.  Applicants that use the Cyber Assistant tool may be offered a reduced user fee as opposed to others who fill in their applications themselves.  

Q13.	Will interested vendors be required to develop and market the final product without IRS assistance (financial or otherwise)?
A13.	Interested and qualified vendors will be provided with the documents that the IRS has created such as business rules, schema formats, data model formats and the IRS-approved educational content, free of charge to incorporate into their own application.    Marketing efforts can be supported with publicity but not by funding by the IRS.   

Q14. 	What are the projected timelines, RFP deadline, and Award Date?
A14.	The IRS projects the development, test and pilot period will run for the next year, in FY 2007.  The IRS does not intend to fund proposals or make a contract award.  Rather, the IRS expects developers or partners will be interested for their own marketing purposes.  

Q15.	Will this be the only application, mandatory for all users, or will there be other competing applications?  
A15.	There could be more than one acceptable vendor of the application.  Use of the developed tool will not be mandatory.   The IRS would be working with any potential vendor to ensure that the IRS approved educational information is incorporated, that the application performs acceptably and that an adequate number of test users are available as supplied by the successful test vendor (s).    

Q16. 	Depending on your evaluation of our RFI response, can we request that this be deemed a set aside for HUBZone and SDVOSB?  
A16.	We will be evaluating all responses received to determine capability.  We will consider a set-aside of all types (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, Small) depending on the capability of those firms to perform the required s
Q
rvices.  If there are two or more of any type of firm with the capability, we will consider a set-aside for that particular type.     

Q17.	The RFI states that responses should be sent as an MS Word attachment.  Most contractors prefer to send a PDF file.  This ensures that none of the information contained in the response gets lost.  Is it an absolute requirement that the response be sent as an MS Word attachment or can we send a PDF file instead?  
A17.	A PDF file is acceptable.   
 


Q18.	The RFI states that we should briefly describe our company?s financial information.  Would you please clarify what type of financial information you need us to supply.

A18.	The purpose of this requested item is to determine whether a responder has adequate financial history, sufficient stability and experience to undertake the development and marketing task.  Recent financial statements that provide that type of information are sufficient.   

Q19.	In section 1 part (3.) it is states that the applicants, completing the IRS Form 1023, would also be required to submit a user fee along with the application. Is it the expectation of the IRS that the strategic partner will collect the fee for the government? 
A19.	No, the strategic partner would not collect the fee for the government.  Applicants are required to submit a user fee to the IRS in order to receive the requested determination letter on exempt status.  The user fee is part of the completed application package that is submitted by the applicant via the mail or other delivery service.  The IRS is considering a reduction in user fees for users of the Cyber Assistant tool.  


 Q20.	One of the requested items is financial information, which we will gladly include.  We would like clarification as to what is desired in that regard.  We can provide current financial statements, prior tax returns or a combination of both.  We want to send only what is needed.  

A20	Refer to A18.

Q20a.	Will the strategic partner be able to charge the applicant for performing the service? (not the IRS fee)   
A20a.	Whether a strategic partner charges an applicant for using Cyber Assistant is up to the partner.  

Q21.    	If so, will the IRS, limit the charges or regulate the charges?   
A21	No.  

Q22.    	If so, will there be a set price or will the strategic partners compete within themselves? 
A22.	There will not be a set price; the market will determine the price.  

Q23.   	Will the IRS be paying the strategic partner for performing the service? 
A23.	No.  

Q24.    	How often does IRS TEGE expects that form 1023 will be updated? 
A24	Any revision to the IRS Form 1023 is at the discretion of the Service or as may be required to incorporate legislative change(s) to the requirements for tax-exempt status.  There is no schedule for revision at this time.  

Q25.	Could the IRS please share the questions received from other vendors and the answers to them? 

A25.	All questions and answers appear here.    

Please note:  The due date for responses to this RFI shall be changed from October 11, 2006 to October 16, 2006.  The Government will no longer accept any more questions regarding this RFI.

<SUBJECT>A -- Respiratory Distress in Newborns and Its Relationship to Group B Streptococcal Colonization
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NICHD-SS-GBS
<RESPDATE>102006

<CONTACT>Mya Hlaing, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6958, Fax 301-402-3676, Email mh89m@nih.gov
<DESC>Background:
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is interested in identifying whether there are interested Small Business Concerns with the requisite capabilities to assist in conducting a clinical study relating respiratory distress in newborns to group B streptococcal colonization.  
Phospholipids from group B streptococcal (GBS) cell wall cause pulmonary hypertension in experimental animals. When exposed to penicillin, Streptococcus mutans releases phospholipids immediately.  Preliminary data from a NICHD multi center study have shown that 8.8% newborns colonized by GBS at birth had signs of respiratory distress within 48 hours after birth (cases). In 60% of the cases, oxygen supplementation was used, in 5% mechanical ventilation was required, and in 2% persistent pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed. Compared with light colonization, heavy colonization increased the rate of respiratory distress 1.73 fold, a discharge diagnosis of respiratory disorder 2.02 fold, a blood/CSF obtained for culture 1.54 fold and antibiotic administration after birth 1.87 fold. Penicillin use during labor was associated with a 2.62 fold increase in respiratory distress in the colonized newborn.
These findings support the association of neonatal respiratory distress with ?asymptomatic? GBS colonization and with penicillin use during labor.   We hypothesize that newborns colonized with GBS receive bacterial phospholipids leading to pulmonary hypertension and respiratory distress, especially in the situation of newborns of penicillin-treated mothers. 
Objective:
The proposed study aims to relate the levels of serum bacterial phospholipids to the occurrence of respiratory distress in newborns of mothers colonized by GBS. The study will examine the pathologic effects of "asymptomatic" carriage of GBS and the effects of penicillin during labor on the occurrence of respiratory distress in newborns. 
Scope:
It is estimated that ~320 newborns of > 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress within 24 hours after birth and ~1600 mothers who are GBS carriers will need to be recruited within 12 months.  To achieve that, about 8,000 mothers of >32 weeks gestation will be cultured for GBS carriage by obtaining vaginal and rectal swabs on admission to the labor and delivery room. Their newborns will be swabbed from 4 surface sites (throat, anus, ears and umbilicus) shortly after birth before the first bath to identify those who are colonized with GBS [and those who are not].  

Maternal and cord blood samples will be collected from a random sample of 10% of newborns born to colonized mothers (about 160 newborns) and an equal number of non-colonized randomly selected newborns, penicillin treated and untreated groups(130 samples from each group).  A 0.25 mL blood sample designated for this study will be collected from newborns with respiratory distress and from asymptomatic newborns (controls) with a case:control ratio of 1:1 at the time of metabolic screening.			

Medical records of the symptomatic newborns and the controls, penicillin treated and untreated mothers and newborns; and selected newborns of colonized and non-colonized mothers will be reviewed for demographic, clinical and epidemiological characteristics. 
Capability Requirements:
To be deemed capable to serve as an anticipated clinical site for this study, a Small Business Concern must submit a written capability statement that demonstrate the ability to: 1) within 12 months recruit 8,000 mothers of > 32 weeks gestation for vaginal and rectal cultures in order to identify ~1600 mothers colonized with GBS and 800 newborns colonized by GBS at birth; 2) identify ~320 newborns of > 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress within 24 hours after birth, select asymptomatic newborns as controls at a case:control ratio of 1:1 and obtain blood samples from these newborns; 3) have the capacity to provide tertiary nursery care for these newborns; 4) identify newborns of penicillin treated mothers and equal number of newborns of untreated mothers; 5) obtain maternal and cord serum samples from newborns of mothers colonized with GBS, newborns of mothers not-colonized with GBS, newborns of mothers treated with penicillin during labor and newborns of untreated mothers (about 160 newborns in each group); 6) obtain clinical, epidemiological data from medical records of above mothers and newborns. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710. Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less. See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Mya Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NIDDK Office of Acquisitions, NICHD Branch, (Overnight address: 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 7A07, Rockville, Maryland 20832) (Regular Postal service: 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 7A07, Bethesda, Maryland 20892) by 3:00 PM Local Time on October 20, 2006.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  Please submit an original and 5 hard copies. (See numbered Note #25) (No collect calls will be accepted, No facisimile transactions, No electronic copies will be accepted).  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses.

<DESC>This notice is a revision of Reference No. SS-ES-06-08.
The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is requesting information to determine the availability of interested parties to provide support and interpretation of multimodality imaging capability, including but not limited to micro-CT, digital subtraction angiography, micro-PET, two-photon/one-photon confocal microscopy, and ultrasound imaging as well as operate an MRI and multimodality imaging facility for small rodent species in support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  Based upon the location of the appropriate equipment, the contractor may be required to work off-site.

The Offeror shall provide support to:
1.  Operate a Government-furnished 7 Tesla MRI system which consists of a 210 mm bore Magnex Scientific superconducting magnet with shielded gradients, a GE Medical Systems EXCITE console, and RF subsystems specific for imaging small laboratory rodent species. 

2. Maintain and extend the capability of this system as required by the NIEHS for extended capabilities such as increased spatial resolution, specific tissue contrast, and high specimen throughput.

3.  Perform MR imaging of rodent tissue specimens at a spatial resolution that is more than 300,000X greater than that routinely used on clinical imaging systems. The field of view for imaging may be directed at observations of the whole animal (e.g. mouse embryos or fetuses) and specific functional systems and /or organs (e.g. mouse brains, heart, lungs). This will entail; a.) The use of specialized tissue preparation methods for specimen fixation (use of alternate contrast agents, perfusion fixation), b.) Manufacture of specialized radiofrequency coils, and c.) Integration of unique image acquisition strategies and novel reconstruction methods to allow rapid acquisition (acquisition times of < 3 hrs) of very large high-quality image arrays (> 4 GB/image) with isotropic 3D spatial resolution < 25 microns. Tissue specimens shall be prepared in a manner that would permit subsequent evaluation of tissues by conventional histology following imaging.  Additional modalities for imaging small laboratory rodents such as micro-CT, ultra sound, molecular imaging and other specialized optical modalities may be required. The Contractor shall develop and operate such systems as appropriate for small animal (rodent) imaging in support of NIEHS studies.

4.  Perform longitudinal (in vivo) imaging studies in which the same animal(s) is/are imaged at multiple times to observe the time course and response (temporal pathogenesis and/or recovery) and pathology (development of anatomic features such as tumor growth) associated with exposure to xenobiotics.  Such studies shall require the use of specialized equipment and procedures for animal support structures and anesthesia to minimize motion, careful control of body temperature, and radiofrequency coils adapted to the very high magnetic field environment. 

5.  Provide and/or use a government furnished web-accessible digital electronic system for managing the access, review, downloading, and the archive of digital image data files and collateral documents pertaining to scientific imaging studies. The system must have the capacity to handle an exceptionally broad range of digitized imagery including conventional histology, very large 3D image arrays generated in MR histology, microCT, microPET, power point presentations, scanned images and other imagery, data, and collateral documentation. This scientific imaging management system must include the capability of enabling any user at NIEHS to access the images, data sets, and collateral documents from multiple sites with commonly used personal computers and modes of Internet access. 

6.  Provide expertise/advice concerning rodent magnetic resonance image acquisition strategy, MRI image quality, and its biological and/or scientific significance.  Participate in interpretation of the generated images and/or provide training in sample preparation and/or image interpretation for NIEHS investigators.

7.  The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following: 1) The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov; 2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association For Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (CFR 21 Part 85).

MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS: The following mandatory qualification criteria must be met at the time of award:  1) the contractor shall provide an imaging facility, equipment except for magnet and APPROPRIATE staff dedicated exclusively to support of NIEHS/NTP studies; 2) the facility shall be located within a 30 to 45 minute driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709; 3) the facility shall be accessible to NIEHS/NTP scientists; 4) all components of the Imaging Facility and the support areas including offices, and laboratories and a facility for temporary housing of small laboratory rodents in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (PL89-544) shall be located on one  site.

For estimating purposes the Government estimates the level-of effort at 5,850 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional  2,500 direct labor hours; Professional Support  1,000 direct labor hours; Technical  2,200 direct labor hours; Administrative Support  150 direct labor hours. 

INTERESTED OFFERORS SHOULD SUBMIT (5) COPIES OF THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTEEN (15) PAGES IN LENGTH, EXCLUDING STANDARD BROCHURES, ETC., FOR RECEIPT BY THE AGENCY ON June 27, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Capital Equipment for Low-Volume N/MEMS Manufacturing
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) regarding the development of capital equipment to address the needs of Low-Volume Nano and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (N/MEMS) fabrication and manufacturing. 

The fabrication of N/MEMS devices has historically been accomplished using equipment originally designed for the semiconductor (e.g. CMOS) industry. The availability of this equipment has greatly assisted in the development of N/MEMS technology. However, in addition to some differences in performance requirements, there is a fundamental difference in terms of production volume between the needs of military N/MEMS products and the capabilities of commercial semiconductor equipment. Military systems typically require from 10-100,000 devices per year. Semiconductor tools using four-inch wafers are designed to produce 1,000,000 units per year or more. Thus, even using out-of-date four-inch equipment, N/MEMS production facilities are oversized for military devices by 10x to 100,000x. The semiconductor industry has moved on to six-inch, eight-inch and 12 inch wafers. As this happens, and as four-inch equipment becomes increasingly hard to obtain, the gap between the needs of military production and the capabilities of available equipment will only continue to increase. 

In addition to capital costs, the unwarranted scale of semiconductor capital equipment results in substantial additional maintenance costs, drives up materials costs, requires additional staff to maintain, and requires additional rent and utilities. Even if one obtains capital equipment for free, the maintenance costs (which are often about the same as depreciation costs) can make owning such equipment unaffordable. 

The MEMS industry has worked to address this problem by moving to a "MEMS Foundry" model. In this model, equipment is owned by one company who performs fabrication services for a range of other companies. This approach can help distribute costs to some extent, but also creates additional issues. First, N/MEMS devices, unlike semiconductor devices, each require their own process. These processes are often incompatible (e.g. use of gold or other matererials), meaning that it is sometimes impossible for multiple devices to be run at a single facility. Second, for devices that are compatible, production time ends up being dominated by changeover time. That is, while it may only take 1% or less of a facility's capacity to produce a year?s supply of product, it may take weeks to change the facility over from one process to another. Thus, one's ability to spread costs over multiple devices is dominated by changeover costs, not production costs. These costs only get worse as we move to larger wafers sizes. Third, because each product is such a small percentage of the overall production mix going through a facility, and since that product mix is always changing, it becomes very difficult to maintain uniform process conditions and repeatable production. This lack of uniformity impacts device performance, device reliability, and can create significant supply interruptions. 

In short, though N/MEMS has benefited from the existence of semiconductor capital equipment, continuing to rely upon semiconductor equipment to produce N/MEMS device, particularly military N/MEMS devices, may be untenable. 

DARPA can envision two potential solutions to this dilemma. A partial solution would be to create equipment for use by MEMS foundries whose performance is inherently uniform and repeatable when exposed to a continuously varying product mix. While this approach does not address the issue of process compatibility, it would enable compatible processes to be run with higher performance and reliability within a single facility. Such an approach may require new strategies for process control, monitoring, and simulation. DARPA seeks revolutionary concepts for processing tools to enable a new paradigm for high process mix manufacturing for N/MEMS components. DARPA requests individuals with ideas for creating such inherently flexible, affordable, and repeatable N/MEMS capital equipment submit a brief description of their ideas by email, by the published response date, to Dr. John D. Evans at John.Evans@DARPA.mil.

A second and more comprehensive approach is to develop a set of capital equipment that is sufficiently inexpensive that a complete tool set can be devoted to each process. With such low cost capital equipment, each tool set would see only once process, and thus process compatibility is not an issue. Additionally, because each tool is only required to perform a single process, process repeatability can be dramatically improved. While the process performance for such tools would have to be comparable to existing equipment, throughput could be dramatically reduced. 

This RFI seeks to solicit ideas relevant to the creation of a tool set specifically designed for the production of low-volume N/MEMS devices. This equipment would be designed to:

1.  Decrease the cost of capital equipment by 10x relative to existing new four-inch equipment.
2. Target a production throughput of 10,000 units per year (square centimeters per year). This is approximately 100x lower than current four-inch facilities. Where a process requires a piece of equipment be used multiple times during the execution of a process, the tool must be appropriately sized to accommodate such use.
3.  Maintain process performance relative to existing N/MEMS equipment (e.g. 1-2 um linewidths for contact lithography).
4.  Maintain "hot-lot" turnaround times of less than 4 weeks (layout to devices). Hot lot turnaround time is defined as the time it takes to execute a lot of wafers (e.g. 5 wafers) where the lot never has to wait for equipment to become available.

Additionally, this equipment would be designed to meet the following specifications:

1.  Facilities. Tools will be completely self-contained and require no external facilities other than HEPA filter coverage, house ventilation, vacuum (for wands, etc.), nitrogen, Clean Dry Air (CDA), De-Ionized (DI) water, and general DI water waste (presumably to carboy).
2.  Footprint. Tools will fit within the footprint of one (or more) standard pallets (e.g. 48 x 40 inches).
3.  Transportability. Tools will be transportable using a standard forklift, so that they can be easily relocated or transported at end of a each project. 
4.  Set-up / Take-down. Tools shall be able to be packed up for shipping in under 4 hours, and be able to be unpacked and put into service in 4 hours. This would enable a complete production line to be assembled in approximately one week. 
5.  Access. Tools will require only front access for normal operation. Tool will roll fore-and-aft under human power for maintenance. These requirements enable a significant decrease in total cleanroom footprint for each tool
6.  Power. Tools will operate on standard 110V or 220V power, and come with standard plug.
7.  Consumables. Dirty consumables (e.g. gas bottles) will be stored within the footprint of the tool, preferably near the floor. Consumable storage will be appropriately sized to the throughput of the tool.
8.  Chemical waste. Chemical waste will be sent to carboy (or treated) and contained within the footprint of the tool, preferably near the floor. Chemical waste storage will be appropriately sized to the throughput of the tool.
9.  Safety. Tool will include all necessary safety systems, such as gas monitoring systems. 

To this end, DARPA is soliciting strategies for realizing this equipment. Though DARPA is interested in all classes of capital equipment, the following ten areas are of particular interest.

1.  Deposition (e.g. PECVD / CVD) for silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and polysilicon. 
2.  Deposition (e.g. sputtering) of metals.
3.  Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, polysilicon, and metals.
4.  Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) of silicon and xenon difluoride isotropic silicon etching.
5.  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) & Critical Dimension (CD) measurement.
6.  Film Thickness Measurement
7.  Patterning (e.g. lithography). Critical dimensions of 1-2 um.
8.  Wet processing. (e.g. spin coating, bake, develop, wet etch, wafer cleaning).  
9.  Wafer bonding.
10.  Facilities. An integrated package of equipment providing vacuum (for wands, etc.), house nitrogen, clean dry air (CDA), de-ionized (DI) water, and DI water waste (presumably to carboy).  

DARPA solicits potential performers to submit ideas for creating such low-cost capital equipment for use by the government in formulating a potential formal solicitation. DARPA requests that those interested in this topic indicate their interest immediately by email to Dr. John D. Evans at John.Evans@DARPA.mil. DARPA further request that interested parties provide, by the published response date, a submission describing a strategy for realizing a 10x decrease in cost for a specific piece of equipment. Performers should provide a basis for their cost analysis (such as a hypothetical Bill of Materials), and a comparison of that cost with the cost of the existing equipment that their new equipment would replace. Performers should also identify the technical (i.e. research) challenges inherent in realizing this capital equipment.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses should be limited to five pages for any given concept. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. For all RFI responses, an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact and contact information. RFI responses should be received no later than 4:00pm (Eastern) October 30, 2006. 

RFI Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be e-mailed or mailed on a CD-ROM to:

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.  No other solicitation will be issued; proposals are being requested via this notice.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires the publication of legal advertisements for the purpose of announcing property seizures.  ATF is mandated by law to publish all property that is seized for forfeiture.  This has been further defined by the Asset Forfeiture Law and Practice Manual as,  ?Notice of the seizure of property and the intent to forfeit must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the proceeding is brought.?    In addition, it has been determined this requirement can be met by publication in a national newspaper that meets certain circulation requirements.  ATF is mandated by Congress to publish all administrative seizures in a newspaper of general circulation in all 92 judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement must be published in a newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks.  The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all interested parties such as a lien holder or other unknown individuals who may have a vested interest in the property.  The contractor shall publish the legal advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation.  That is, a newspaper that publishes news of general interest and character to the public, to include political and business events, circulating among the general public in each of the Federal judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement shall include, at a minimum, specific descriptive information regarding the property and its seizure by ATF.  In addition the advertisement will include instructions as to how parties with an interest in the property seized can file a claim to contest the seizure and intended forfeiture of the property.  The boundaries of the following Federal judicial districts correspond to the state or territorial boundaries.  Therefore, circulation figures for these states or territories will demonstrate circulation for the judicial district:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Guam.  In the following cases, more than one Federal judicial district is located within a state.  These judicial districts are given, along with the United States Code (U.S.C.) citation, which lists the counties that comprise the district.  Offerors may satisfy that it publishes in substantial quantities in the Federal judicial district, by demonstrating that it sells at least the minimum number of copies in the counties that comprise the district: Alabama, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 81(a); Alabama, Middle -28 U.S.C. 81(b); Alabama, Southern -28 U.S.C. 81 (c); Alaska -28 U.S.C. 81A; Arizona - 28 U.S.C. 82; Arkansas, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 83(a); Arkansas, Western - 28 U.S.C. 83(b); California, Northern -28 U.S.C. 84(a); California, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 84(b); California, Central - 28 U.S.C.  84 (c); California, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 84(d); Colorado - 28 U.S.C. 85; Connecticut - 28 U.S.C. 86; Delaware - 28 U.S.C. 87; District of Columbia - 28 U.S.C 88; Florida, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 89(a); Florida, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 89(b); Florida, Southern -28 U.S.C. 89 (c); Georgia, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 90(a); Georgia, Middle; - 28 U.S.C. 90(b); Georgia, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 90 (c); Hawaii - 28 U.S.C. 91; Idaho - 28 U.S.C. 92; Illinois, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 93(a); Illinois, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 93(b); Illinois, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 93 (c); Indiana, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 94(a); Indiana, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 94(b); Iowa, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 95(a); Iowa, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 95(b); Kansas - 28 U.S. C. 96; Kentucky, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 97(a); Kentucky, Western - 28 U.S.C. 97(b); Louisiana, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 98(a); Louisiana, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 98(a)2; Louisiana, Western - 28 U.S.C. 98(b); Maine - 28 U.S.C. 99; Maryland - 28 U.S.C. 100; Massachusetts - 28 U.S.C. 101; Michigan, Eastern ? 28 U.S.C. 102(a); Michigan, Western - 28 U.S.C. 102(b); Minnesota - 28 U.S.C. 103; Mississippi, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 104(a); Mississippi, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 104(b); Missouri, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 105(a); Missouri, Western - 28 U.S.C.  105(b); Montana - 28 U.S.C. 106; Nebraska - 28 U.S.C. 107; Nevada - 28 U.S.C. 108; New Hampshire - 28 U.S.C. 109; New Jersey - 28 U.S.C. 110; New Mexico - 28 U.S.C. 111; New York, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 112(a); New York, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 112(b); New York, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 112 (c); New York, Western - 28 U.S.C. 112(d); North Carolina, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 113(a); North Carolina, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 113(b); North Carolina, Western - 28 U.S.C. 113(c); North Dakota - 28 U.S.C. 114; Ohio, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 115(a); Ohio, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 115(b); Oklahoma, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 116 (a); Oklahoma, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 116 (b); Oklahoma, Western - 28 U.S.C. 116 (c); Oregon - 28 U.S.C. 117; Pennsylvania, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 118(a); Pennsylvania, Middle - 28 U.S.C.  118(b); Pennsylvania, Western - 28 U.S.C. 118(c); Puerto Rico - 28 U.S.C. 119; Rhode Island - 28 U.S.C. 120; South Carolina - 28 U.S.C. 121; South Dakota - 28 U.S.C. 122; Tennessee, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 123(a); Tennessee, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 123(b); Tennessee, Western - 28 U.S.C. 123(c); Texas, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 124(a); Texas, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 124(b); Texas, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 124(c); Texas, Western - 28 U.S.C. 124(d); Utah - 28 U.S.C. 125; Vermont - 28 U.S.C. 126; Virgin Islands - 28 U.S.C. 118 (a); Virginia, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 127(a); Virginia, Western - 28 U.S.C. 127(b); Washington, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 128(a); Washington, Western - 28 U.S.C. 128(b); West Virginia, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 129(a); West Virginia, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 129(b); Wisconsin, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 130(a); Wisconsin, Western - 28 U.S.C. 130(b); Wyoming - 28 U.S.C. 131, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Included in the draft should be written the font size used and the cost of the advertisement.
