<DESC>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-03
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.910</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods to enable the Assured Cyber Architectures (ACA) vision in support of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E). The ACA BAA seeks significant advances to the DI2E mission across the following sub-disciplines.</p>
<p>The sub-disciplines of interest to this solicitation include:</p>
<p>1. Infrastructure Service Technologies - Critical information assurance components for infrastructures and the ability to address a range of security issues to include (but not limited to): Identity Management, Access Management, Credential Management, Authentication Management, Cryptography Management, Security Metadata Management, Digital Policy Management, and System and Communication Protection.</p>
<p>2. Content Service Technologies - Ability to coordinate, optimize, and execute orchestration of services across information infrastructures.</p>
<p>3. Application Service Technologies - In a Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) environment there will be common services used as to not replicate duplicative code across services. These include everything from semantic search capabilities to data analytics and mediation services, content management, and verifying quality.</p>
<p>4. Enterprise Evaluation - Ability to evaluate components for inclusion in integrated prototype architectures.</p>
<p>5. Mission Service Technologies - The final layer in a SOA environment are the actual tools to be utilized, which are primarily analytical and processing tools specific for the intelligence community.</p>
<p>The innovative ACA technologies supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.</p>
<p>The ACA BAA will investigate assured computing architectures and associated technologies that will ultimately be incorporated within the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). The goal of interfacing with the DI2E is twofold; first, provide a more cohesive and complete situational awareness and assessment of enemy activities for on-going US missions, and second, provide surgical cueing for ACA opportunities. Automated knowledge-based tools and decision aids will provide a more effective use of the DI2E with its complementary intelligence data for improved Situational Awareness. The development of infrastructures, tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst in providing timely and highly accurate characterization of signals, objects and events leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to the warfighter.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 14 - $10.3M; FY 15 - $9.6M; FY 16 - $10M; FY 17 - $10M; and FY18 - $10M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $500K and $3M per year. There is also the potential to make awards above or below this range. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, depending upon the nature of the work proposed. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process.</p>

<DESC><p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA- RIK-14-04</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to employ existing and emerging technologies to develop and demonstrate automated, real-time signal detection, processing, exploitation, and reporting capabilities of existing and emerging Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) signals in support of ground and airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Technology applications include, but are not limited to: (1) the enhancement of ELINT signal processing software and hardware to address the increased complexity and volume of the ELINT battlespace; (2) the enhancement of collection system efficiency for single and multi-platform collection optimization and management; (3) the development of technology for the detection and exploitation of emerging ELINT signals and systems; and (4) the enhancement of effectiveness of databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems.</p>
<p>Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows: (1) ELINT emitter detection, identification, geolocation, and tracking: Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT assets to provide current threat analysis and assessment for successful war-fighting planning and resource management; a need for real-time detection, identification, geolocation, tracking, and reporting is required to prosecute existing and emerging ELINT systems that employ short-up-time tactics in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) regions; (2) Automated signal collection, identification and first level processing: emerging ELINT systems employ advanced modulation, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals that dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board/off-board assets; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing: Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena; (4) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect emerging signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include, but not be limited, to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-INT sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management. Deliverables will include technical reports and when appropriate, demonstrations, software and hardware.</p>
<p><br />II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E14PS00016 for Proposed Research on Safety and Technology Verification of Oil and Gas Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to BSEE, Technology Assessment Program (TAP) on Safety and Technology Verification of Oil and Gas Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research. For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:
The BSEE TAP Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals. Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding from FY 2014. NOTICE: The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.
OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2014 Safety and Technology Verification of Oil and Gas Operations are limited to the following topics:
1. Evaluation of Automated Well Safety Technologies: Evaluate and identify automated well safety technologies with the potential to increase safety during OCS drilling, well completion, well work over and production operations. The pros and cons of each identified technology shall be determined. Each systems applicability to OCS operations shall be identified, and recommended to the BSEE on how these systems can be included in BSEEs regulatory program. Analysis  shall be conducted on identifying a system that can be used to override human behavior and take control of drilling operations when personnel have been put into a risky situation; (i.e., a kick has been detected down hole). Such a system would need to automatically curtail drilling operations, pick the drill string off bottom, and stop the mud pumps so personnel can conduct a flow check and decide how to proceed.
2. Early Kick Technology Evaluation: Assess early well kick detection approaches, equipment, techniques, and systems associated with drilling operations in the OCS.  Technologies to address shall include but not be limited to behind the bit tools such as Measuring While Drilling (MWD), Logging While Drilling (LWD), Pressure While Drilling (PWD), and other equipment.  The assessment will not only address what is currently being used by industry in the OCS, but will also include an assessment of how early kick detection technologies; systems or equipment are implemented globally under other regulatory jurisdictions (both onshore and offshore). Recommendation must be provided to the BSEE concerning if such technology should be included in the regulations and under what conditions.
3. Evaluate Oil and Gas Industries Ability to Perform Blow-out Preventer (BOP) Shearing Tests Under Simulated Blowout Flow Condition: Identify available facilities in the continental USA with the capability to provide BOP shear testing under fluid flow conditions through both a surface and subsea BOP stack (including a blind-shear ram) to simulate a loss of well control event.  Categorize the performance capabilities of identified facilities for possible use by the BSEE in a future series of tests.  Determine cost information for a series of BSEE specified shear tests for each identified facility and provide BSEE a catalogue of all facilities including their capabilities, location and costs for BSEE identified tests. 
4. Capping Stack Technology Requirements:  Assess currently available offshore capping stack technology and develop recommended design, manufacture, maintenance, and inspection criteria for use by BSEE engineering and inspection personnel. Capping stack technology to be evaluated should include Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and any capping stack technology in use overseas.  Evaluation should include both cap and cap and flow type systems.  Furnish set of usable BSEE Potential Incidents of Non Compliance (PINC) prepared in accordance with the format included in the National PINC Guideline list which can be used by BSEE inspectors both in the field and at onshore support bases and manufacturing establishments.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Mr. Sagar S. Damania, not later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Time on January 28, 2014. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER. The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits. IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER. Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received. BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal. This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award. Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted.

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) proposes to award a single source contract to Management Concepts Incorporated (MCI) to continue delivery of an uninterrupted training requirement schedule for FAA Funds Certifiers.  This contract is necessary as the current training support, under an OPM agreement, has expired.  The FAA intends to issue a competitive solicitation for these services.  While a follow-on competitive procurement is not available at this time, a Screening Information Request (SIR) is planned for award this FY14. 
In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the WJHTC decision to contract with a select source via a single source procedure.

<a href="mailto:michael.thomey@hq.doe.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) has a requirement for providing financial audits of the Department?s consolidated financial statements.  The financial statement audits will determine if the financial statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These audits are among the largest and most labor intensive in the Federal Government, involving work at over 30 facility management contractors and 45 Department sites in 28 states and Washington, DC.  These facility contractors maintain separate accounting systems with unique systems of internal controls that must be individually reviewed.  In addition to the consolidated financial statement audit and related information technology (IT) work, separate fund audits must be conducted simultaneously for multiple Department program offices.  Complex accounting procedures and methodologies are needed to analyze, integrate, and convey the results of all audit work.  Among other requirements, specialized expertise is needed to:
?	Analyze the Department?s environmental liabilities (currently exceeds $200 billion); ?	Confirm nuclear materials inventories; ?	Evaluate the work of specialists in pensions and actuarial estimates, petroleum inventories, and IT network vulnerability and penetration testing; and, ?	Coordinate extensively with other Federal agencies on complicated financial matters such as asset depreciation, in order to validate financial statements of the Department?s power marketing administrations which contain data from those other Federal agencies.  
The Office of Inspector General manages the conduct of all audit work to be performed by the contracted auditor and as such has interpreted audit standards to require that the principal auditor (the prime contractor) must directly perform the vast majority of the audit work in order to issue the audit opinion on the Department?s consolidated financial statements.  This means the prime contractor can only subcontract 20 to 25 percent of the audit work, in total, to subcontractor teaming partners.
The contractor will (1) plan each audit using a risk based assessment methodology; (2) issue an opinion or disclaimer of opinion on the financial statements; (3) conduct an evaluation of and reporting on internal control over financial reporting; (4) conduct an evaluation of and reporting on the entity?s compliance with laws and regulations expected to have a material effect on the financial statements under audit; (5) prepare management letters describing internal control deficiencies not considered to be material weakness or reportable conditions; (6) develop recommendations on how to correct reportable conditions and material weaknesses observed during the conduct of financial audits; (7) perform agreed upon procedures related to penetration testing and information controls for non-financial systems under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002; and (8) perform other agreed upon procedures and reporting the results of those procedures as required by OMB, De partment of Treasury, Office of Personnel Management, or other laws or regulations.

<DESC>Description
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis maintenance services for Flow Cytometry instrumentation from Becton Dickinson Biosciences 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131-1807.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Experimental Immunology Branch Flow Cytometry Facility provides basic research support to members of the EIB as well as to investigators throughout CCR, NCI. Support is provided using multiple instruments manufactured by BD Biosciences. Support is provided 5 days per week to approximately 75 users. Each instrument supports multiple experiments each day, and each instrument if fully utilized.</p>
<p>The experiments performed involve costly reagents, expensive animals, and multiple man-hours. When an instrument malfunctions, or does not operate optimally, these costly experiments are lost. It is therefore necessary that all instrumentation operate in an optimal fashion, and that down time due to malfunctions and repair time be minimized. Because the nature of the equipment is highly experimental, the OEM routinely designs and implements software and hardware improvements to the instrumentation. It is essential to the EIB that these revisions be installed in a timely fashion to maintain optimal performance.<br /><br />Contractor Requirements are:</p>
<p>1. In order to maintain optimal performance and to minimize down time, the EIB requires maintenance services for the EIB flow cytometry instrumentation that includes:</p>
<p>a) Contractor shall perform timely on-site repair by factory trained personnel and including OEM parts, labor and travel. All on-site repairs shall be performed without requirement for any additional purchase orders from the government or from the contractor to the field engineer services engineer vendor.<br />b) All repairs shall be completed to conform to OEM standards.<br />c) In order to provide timely response, the contractor shall maintain an OEM trained local (Washington Metropolitan area) field service technical workforce, as well as an OEM spare parts inventory and a telephone consultation technical workforce.<br />d) Guaranteed on-site response time by field engineer of 48 hours or less for all repairs.<br />e) Guaranteed priority dispatch status of field engineers equivalent to that offered by the OEM to OEM contract customers.<br />f) Contractor shall perform telephone support to include expert technical engineering advice, all instruments.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Genome Integrity (LGI), plans to procure on a sole source basis hardware upgrades installation and Zeiss Efficient Navigation (ZEN) software for existing Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 from Carl Zeiss Microscopy One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery date: 6 weeks after award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The laboratory of Genome Integrity (LGI) currently maintains a Zeiss microscope (Axio Observer Z1 Stand Mot; Serial #: 3834004401). This procurement will enable the purchase of a DIC slider and beam combiner along with objectives and software upgrades from the existing Axiovision software to Zeiss Efficient Navigation (ZEN). As part of the purchase, LGI will also acquire an imaging workstation and a 30" monitor. The robust, rapid and quantitative visual measurements of DNA damage response proteins in the nucleus are critical to our understanding of the cascade of signaling events involved in the damage and repair pathways. The Laboratory of Genome Integrity is seeking to make these purchases in order to meet NCI's current and future scientific demands.</p>
<p>Carl Zeiss is the only company that can provide the hardware to add to the microscopes while keeping the current service contracts valid. Carl Zeiss is also the only distributor of the proprietary software that drives the microscope and also performs software imaging analysis.<br />Specifically, the hardware needed includes (i) 2 objectives (10x and 20x), (ii) a Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Slider, and (iii) a Beam Combiner for the Definite Focus Module that is already installed. The objectives are manufactured by Zeiss and are the only approved objectives to work on Zeiss microscopes to ensure the high quality imaging specifications required for our project. Each objective requires a DIC Slider in order to establish reflected light. The Beam Combiner is used with the Definite Focus Module to ensure an accurate position between the coverslip and objectives over time and multiple positions. The Beam Combiner is needed to improve the acquisition speed during image collection. <br /><br />The software applications provide an upgrade to our existing Axiovision software to Zeiss Efficient Navigation (ZEN). ZEN fully communicates with the Zeiss AxioObserver microscope to import hardware settings that are used for processing. This software allows us to acquire images at multiple positions on slides and tiles images at those positions using our already installed motorized stage. After acquisition, we are able to use the ZEN software to process the images to get detailed statistical information about the images. <br />Any future modifications to the software can be performed using the built-in functions of ZEN and the integrated Python API (Application Programming Interface) to allow us to easily and quickly change the processing code. This is essential for future assay development and integration into out processing pipelines. In addition, the confocal core at NCI uses ZEN software, so this will reduce training requirements when lab members move between the wide-field and confocal microscopes for imaging.</p>
<p>Contractor shall meet the following features:</p>
<p>Hardware specifications and requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Compatible Objectives: Objectives compatible with M27 threads and tube lens focal lengths of 165 mm. These need to have magnifications that meet or exceed the following specifications: Plan Apochromat 10X/0.45 NA and Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 NA<br />&bull; DIC slider: Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) slider compatible with Plan Apochromat 10X/0.45 NA and Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 NA objectives. The DIC slider is for creating fluorescence/bright-field overlaid images. This gives extra cellular structural information <br />&bull; Definite Focus Beam combiner: Definite Focus Beam combiner that works with all Zeiss objectives and provides accurate spatial and temporal information between coverslip and objectives<br />Software Components, Specifications and Requirements: <br />&bull; Software Upgrades: Currently used Axiovision software will be upgraded to to ZEN software<br />&bull; Software to control existing CAN stage: Software to control existing Controller Area Network (CAN) stage will allow acquisition of fluorescence and bright-field tiled images at multiple locations on a slide or multi-well plate<br />&bull; Automated, customer-specific, image analysis software: Automated image analysis software that processes acquired images will give counts of features of interest. For example, measurement of foci intensity or co-localization (see attached Pdf for detailed Customer Service Project Plan)<br />&bull; Integrated Python API features: Integrated Python API features will write macros to precisely control microscope and automated image analysis <br />&bull; Interactive GUI: Interactive GUI will generate automated image analysis routines<br />&bull; Offline license: Offline license of this software with an additional computer<br />&bull; Manufacturer supported software: Manufacturer supported software that guarantees full control of hardware components</p>
<p>In summary, because the Carl Zeiss solution has unique features not available from other known companies and is compatible with existing equipment, this will yield additional savings to the laboratory since new systems do not have to be purchased in order to maintain compatibility. Carl Zeiss Microscopy is, therefore, uniquely qualified to provide the equipment.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals from offerors through Full and Open Competition procedures.<br /><br />Health care clinicians are in a unique position to identify substance use disorders in their patients and refer them to treatment, yet they receive little training on drug abuse prevention, early intervention, and treatment options.  NIDA seeks to address this gap in knowledge and the resulting lack of intervention taking place in medical practices through the establishment of a coalition of professional medical organizations and associations to:<br />
<p>1.  Advise NIDA on the educational preferences and needs of health care providers, including primary care and specialist physicians, pediatricians, psychiatrists, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, and others;<br />2.  Serve as content experts in developing new materials, including a Continuing Medical Education/Continuing Education (CME/CE) designed specifically for clinicians who treat America's 24 million adolescents; and<br />3.  Function as the dissemination infrastructure for current and new NIDAMED materials.</p>
<p>Together these activities build on the NIDAMED initiative and broaden it to more fully include the diverse population of health care providers and the at-risk patients they treat.</p>
<p>NIDA intends to solicit proposals from offerors having the capability to perform the following four tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Establish a Coalition of Professional Health Care Organizations and Associations.</p>
<p>The Contractor must establish a Coalition of Professional Health Care Organizations and Associations (Coalition) that have large, national reach and highly respected reputations to serve as the infrastructure for NIDAMED dissemination and as the content experts for newly developed materials.  The Coalition must be comprised of/represent clinicians, such as primary care and specialist physicians, pediatricians, psychiatrists, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, nurses, and nurse practitioners.  The Coalition also must include the participation of experts on adolescent drug use screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) to advise the Coalition.</p>
<p>Task 2: Conduct Formative Research, Develop, and Obtain Accreditation for an Adolescent Drug Use Prevention/Early Intervention Continuing Medical Education/Continuing Education (CME/CE).</p>
<p>Task 3: Market and Disseminate all NIDAMED Products [current and the newly-developed Adolescent Drug Use Prevention/Early Intervention CME/CE (Task 2)].</p>
<p>Task 4: Measure Outreach Methods and NIDAMED Materials/Tools Usage.<br />NIDA has set the goal for the CME/CE created in Task 2 for a minimum of 28,000 health care clinicians to complete the CME/CE course (Task 2) over 5 years.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of a single, 1 year base contract with 4 option years.  NIDA anticipates the contract will include option quantities for level-of-effort hours, and NIDA anticipates the contract will be cost reimbursement and severable.  The earliest RFP No. N01DA-14-1152 would be available is January 6, 2014. You will be able to access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following address: (URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps).

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award contract modifications to the current Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Production contracts with Raytheon Company Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), 1501 72nd Street, North, P.O. Box 12248, St Petersburg, Florida, 33170-2248.</p>
<p>These modifications to existing contracts will provide continued CEC production through fiscal year (FY) 2016.&nbsp; NAVSEA, in cooperation with IWS 6.0, anticipates awarding a competitive CEC Production contract in FY 2015.&nbsp; It is anticipated that a successful offeror will take 18 months to have full production capability.&nbsp; To prevent unacceptable delays in CEC Production, the Government has deemed the issuance of these modifications necessary to fulfill the Navy's CEC production requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; NAVSEA intends to award contract modifications resulting from this synopsis on a sole-source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as Raytheon IDS is the only company that can meet the Navy's current CEC Production requirement while the competitive contract is in the process of being completed.</p>
<p>Cooperative Engagement Capability is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) requires a contract to address the acquisition life cycle of instrumentation related capabilities.  Test Instrumentation, Enterprise, Development and Support (TIEDS) is geared towards the full spectrum of the instrumentation requirement, research, development, production, integration, and sustainment processes.  The purpose of the TIEDS effort is to provide IMO the ability to rapidly support its customers with an integrated and cost effective portfolio of systems supported by consistent and effective systems engineering, development, and sustainment capabilities.  TIEDS is expected to allow PM ITTS IMO to respond to evolving technology and military demands.  The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks.   <br>  <br> A full and open competitive source selection under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as a best value utilizing the trade-off process (FAR 15.101) will be used to determine the best value to the Government.  The procurement awards one Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) (in accordance with FAR 16.5) contract to a single awardee with a period of performance of one base year and four one-year option years.  The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.  CLINs may be Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost Plus Fixed Fee.   <br>  <br> A draft solicitation was posted on 30 October 2013 and an amendment to the draft on 18 December 2013 with final questions due on 30 December 2013.  It is anticipated that the final solicitation will be posted in January of 2014.

The maximum combination of orders is $210,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Unrestricted contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the Unrestricted MATOC contract is $2,500 which applies to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This Unrestricted solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task order at the time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <br><br>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:<br><br> 	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach   <br><br>	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).  <br><br>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 3 August 2012 under solicitation number W9126G-12-R-0108.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 10 September 2012 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.    <br><br>MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $313,950,000.00.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract.

<DESC>AFRL/RW, the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, is looking for information and potential sources in the reconfigurable reprogrammable Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) area. RW pursued advanced Read-Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs) for imaging weapons in the early 2000s and one line of investigation that showed promise was "Variable Acuity Superpixel Imagers (VASITM)". For reference material refer to P. L. McCarley, M. A. Massie, J. P. Curzan, "Foveating infrared imaging sensors", Proc. SPIE Vol. 6660A, (2007) p. 6660A 1-14.The goal of this technology was threefold: 1) cover a wide field of view with a large detector array (512 x 512 or greater), 2) maintain the highest possible spatial resolution on multiple targets of interest within the FOV and 3) operate at the highest possible frame rate while minimizing the output data rate. AFRL/RW has not pursued this technology in several years and with the advent of multi-aperture WFOV optics is now interested in current state-of-the-art technologies in the reconfigurable reprogrammable ROIC area.<br />RW is looking for potential sources that have experience with reconfigurable reprogrammable ROICs. The ROICs should be reconfigurable on a frame-by-frame basis at rates up to thousands of hertz. The ROIC should be capable of reading out arbitrary conglomerations of neighboring pixels (superpixels) of varying shapes, allowing for the placement of high resolution "tracking" windows within lower resolution "surveillance" regions, as well as other arbitrary configurations. Our interests include ROICs in the visible and short wave/mid wave/long wave infrared. <br />This is a request for information and potential sources capable of demonstrating relevant experience with current state-of-the-art reconfigurable reprogrammable ROIC technologies. Respondents should have developed functioning prototypes and documented test results. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS NOTICE OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. The government is interested in experience in the following areas: a) reconfigurable reprogrammable ROIC design and fabrication capabilities, b) prototype concepts developed in the visible and IR wavebands, and c) documented system test results. Based upon the responses to this notice, an Industry Day may be announced at a later date. This is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information submitted is voluntary. Responses will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions, possibly in FY15. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the AFRL Contracting Division, AFRL/RWK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Bldg 13, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6810, ATTN: Ms. MiMi Martin, or sent electronically to mimi.martin@eglin.af.mil. Please provide electronic responses with this subject: Reconfigurable Reprogrammable Read-Out Integrated Circuits (ROICs). Responses must be received no later than 3 PM CT on 31 January 2014. For technical questions, please contact Mr. Shawn Goodrich, at 850-882-4244.<br />

<DESC>Ames Laboratory, a US Department of Energy, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) is identifying potential offerors with capabilities to be the prime or general contractor to construct a Sensitive Instrument Facility for the Ames Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus. This building will be a Federally-owned building. The Ames Laboratory creates innovative materials, technologies and energy solutions. The successful contractor will furnish all labor, material, supervision and equipment required for construction associated with completing the project.
<p>This project includes constructing a specialized facility designed to house ultra-sensitive, state-of-the-art research instruments (e.g. transmission electron microscopes). The site selected meets unique design requirements to accomplish low vibration and low electromagnetic interference (EMI) for the research conducted at this facility. The one story building will be approximately 13,300 gross square feet, and will provide space for six instrument bays, associated control rooms, wet and dry sample preparation laboratories, and staff support space. Foundation structure will include battered pilings, concrete slab thicknesses up to 24", and areas of topping slab set on vibration isolators. The instrument bays have very stringent vibration, acoustic, EMI, and temperature control requirements.  EMI shielding will be incorporated into the construction of the instrument bays. These areas have complex, difficult, and very rigorous construction and installation requirements, and will particularly require expertise in the concrete structure and HVAC components of the facility. The building exterior will be a relatively simple precast architectural concrete that will be compatible with the site. A utility pad will be installed adjacent to the structure with electrical transformer, emergency generator and chillers.</p>
<p>Project will be submitted for LEED Certification with a target of LEED Gold Certification. The estimated construction cost for this project is expected between $6.8 to $7.6 million.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is NOT a request for proposal, and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government, Iowa State University or Ames Laboratory.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be used to pre-qualify potential general contractors. Only respondents of this RFI that meet the required evaluation criteria (Evaluation Criteria Form attached) will be invited to submit a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is anticipated the RFP will be issued in January 2014 and award of a firm-fixed price contract is anticipated for February or March 2014. Construction of the building will begin Spring 2014 is expected to span 12 to 16 months.</p>
<p>Interested firms should send their responses to this RFI by completing the attached .pdf form, <em>Binder 1, </em>by email to spiker@ameslab.gov no later than January 24, 2014 by 4 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) by completing the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire and all other requested documents.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for Market Research and thus is for information and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this Notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>Description:<br />The Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII) is a nimble, entrepreneurial arm of the U.S. Department of Education (the Department).  It makes strategic investments in innovative educational practices through more than 30 discretionary grant programs and coordinates the public school choice and supplemental educational services provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  OII leads the Department's efforts to accelerate the development and broad adoption of new programs, processes, and strategies that will lead to significantly improved educational achievement for all American children.  OII works to encourage innovation both externally and internally, through direct investment in high-need areas and by building the Department's internal capacity to support innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Magnet School Assistance Program (MSAP) is to assist in the desegregation of public schools by supporting the elimination, reduction, and prevention of racial group isolation. In order to meet the statutory purposes of the program, MSAP grantees support the development and implementation of magnet schools that assist in the achievement of systemic reforms and provide all students with the opportunity to meet challenging academic content and student academic achievement standards. Projects support the development and design of innovative education methods and practices that promote diversity and increase choices in public education programs. The MSAP also supports capacity development-the ability of a school to help all its students meet more challenging standards-through professional development and other activities that will enable the continued operation of the magnet schools at a high performance level after funding ends.  Finally, the program supports the implementation of courses of instruction in magnet schools that strengthen students' knowledge of academic subjects and their grasp of tangible and marketable vocational skills.</p>
<p>Under the Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP), the Secretary may reserve not more than 2 percent of the funds appropriated for any fiscal year to carry out evaluations, provide technical assistance, and carry out dissemination projects with respect to magnet school programs assisted under the program.  Grant funds made available under this part may be used by an eligible local educational agency, or consortium of such agencies -</p>
<p>(1) for planning and promotional activities directly related to the development, expansion, continuation, or enhancement of academic programs and services offered at magnet schools;<br />(2) for the acquisition of books, materials, and equipment, including computers and the maintenance and operation of materials, equipment, and computers, necessary to conduct programs in magnet schools;<br />(3) for the compensation, or subsidization of the compensation, of elementary school and secondary school teachers who are highly qualified, and instructional staff where applicable, who are necessary to conduct programs in magnet schools;<br />(4) with respect to a magnet school program offered to less than the entire student population of a school, for instructional activities that - <br />(A) are designed to make available the special curriculum that is offered by the magnet school program to students who are enrolled in the school but who are not enrolled in the magnet school program; and<br />(B) further the purpose of this part;<br />(5) for activities, which may include professional development, that will build the recipient's capacity to operate magnet school programs once the grant period has ended;<br />(6) to enable the local educational agency, or consortium of such agencies, to have more flexibility in the administration of a magnet school program in order to serve students attending a school who are not enrolled in a magnet school program; and<br />(7) to enable the local educational agency, or consortium of such agencies, to have flexibility in designing magnet schools for students in all grades.</p>
<p>Services provided by the contractor under this new contract shall include:<br />&bull;	Meet and communicate with ED representatives and technical assistance provider<br />&bull;	Develop and/or refine monitoring indicators and framework<br />&bull;	Prepare a monitoring schedule<br />&bull;	Identify and train monitoring consultants<br />&bull;	Conduct meetings and/ or webinars prior to site visits<br />&bull;	Collect and analyze information and data collected during the site visit<br />&bull;	Coordinate performance data with other data collections<br />&bull;	Establish and maintain a close working relationship with existing MSAP grantees</p>
<p>&bull;	Establish a web based system with the capacity to: allow MSAP school districts (i.e., grantees) to upload and submit monitoring evidence and documentation against the established indicators; and, to allow for communication exchanges between the contractor and the grantees in finalizing the monitoring reports.<br />&bull;	Prepare comprehensive and synthesized reports<br />&bull;	Develop recommendations for program policy and grant administration<br />&bull;	Develop recommendations for monitoring-related technical assistance<br />&bull;	Demonstrate significant understanding of the MSAP monitoring process and grantee progress<br />&bull;	Submit expenditure/progress reports;</p>
<p>In addition to ED staff's role in providing performance management and monitoring to ensure proper stewardship of taxpayer resources, ED provides grantees project management tools that support individual grantees' work and collaboration amongst grantees.  This Contract is part of an integrated system of supports that ED will offer to MSAP grantees to aid in effective implementation of magnet schools.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance FAR 15.201(e) and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. No funds are available to pay for preparation or responses to this RFI and no entitlement or payment of direct and/or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a vendor's submission of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI is for planning purposes only and any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet Agency requirements as stated herein. <br /><br />The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees, and their families. DeCA currently operates 248 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at $6 billion. Of that total, 178 stores are located within the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii, and 70 stores are located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products, services, and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons." It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide the military community with a great shopping experience; sustain a capable, diverse, and engaged civilian workforce; and be a model organization through agility and governance.</p>
<p>DeCA is in the process of updating the performance work statement (PWS) language for the delicatessen and bakery operations to ensure the requirement performance and goals align with the continued success of DeCA's mission, vision, and goals. DeCA's objective is to utilize industry expertise and best practices and seeks industry comments for the revised PWS language attached hereto.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DeCA requests industry comments on the following language and the feasibility of the pricing elements of the requirement criteria. <br /><br />DeCA is seeking a percentage of savings for each of the five product categories listed below. The amount expressed as a percentage of savings is what the offeror proposes to save the commissary patron on each item for the respective product category when evaluated against same or similar items from comparable commercial supermarket operations in a twenty (20) mile local commuting survey area of each commissary location. Offerors shall propose no less than a twenty (20) percent of savings, for each product category, for each CLIN, and corresponding sub-CLINs, as set forth in a potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. Pricing offered on a sub-CLIN shall be applicable to all locations covered by the CLIN.</p>
<p>Additionally, pricing of the one or more clusters of sub-CLINs offered from the potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES shall include labor, materials, overhead, and profit costs for the work effort required to operate and manage the contracted operations at the locations set forth in the schedule.</p>
<p>**NOTE** The following categories are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>Product Categories:<br />a. Random Weight: Bulk meats, cheeses and other items which are sold by weight and which require additional preparation and or packaging prior to being purchased by the patron. Examples include sliced deli meat, cold salads, salad bar, olives, etc.</p>
<p>b. Bakery: Includes breads, cakes, muffins, pies and other items which are either pre-packaged for immediate sale, or require some preparation from contractor personnel. Specialty items such as wedding cakes, sheet cakes, designer cupcakes, etc. are included in this category.</p>
<p>c. Ready to heat/ready to eat: Items which are prepared by vendor for immediate consumption by the patron, or which have already been cooked and can be reheated for use by patrons. Examples include rotisserie chicken, side dishes, meal solutions, sandwiches, soups, etc.</p>
<p>d. Sushi: Items which are primarily made up of cold rice dressed with vinegar, formed into any of various shapes, and garnished especially with bits of raw seafood or vegetables. Typically these items will be prepared in store, by trained personnel.</p>
<p>e. Non Random Weight: Items which arrive at the store pre-packaged by manufacturer require no additional preparation, for immediate purchase by patrons. These items usually have a manufacturer provided UPC code. Examples include imported, local and ethnic grocery like items.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to twenty-five (25) single-sided pages, Times Roman, size twelve (12)&nbsp;font, and one inch margins.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that a vendor has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, by the cut-off date, to the email address shown below.</p>
<p>The deadline for the receipt of questions and/or comments is the close of business (COB),&nbsp;February 19, 2013. Written queries will be answered by the appropriate subject matter expert. Responses to all questions submitted will be consolidated and posted to www.fbo.gov, no later March 14, 2013. Refer all questions and/or comments via email to Mr. David Leffert, Commissary Management Specialist, Defense Commissary Agency, <a href="mailto:david.leffert@deca.mil">david.leffert@deca.mil</a>.</p>

<a href="mailto:Jason.D.Lou@nasa.gov">Jason Daniel Lou</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is soliciting information to conduct market research to improve its understanding of potential opportunities for providing continued support for the international Argos data collection mission by identifying a host spacecraft for the Advanced Data Collection System instrument (A-DCS) for flight in the 2022 to 2025 timeframe, and possibly beyond.	This instrument would be a follow-on to the A-DCS instrument scheduled to fly on the Polar Free Flyer satellite. The mission requirements, interface requirements and instrument characteristics are identified below. Of primary importance is the orbit, as this instrument will be part of a constellation providing global data collection for the Argos system. For the purpose of this Request For Information (RFI): Host Spacecraft refers to a spacecraft originally intended for purposes other than flying the A-DCS instrument, but which is going to the desired orbit in the desired time frame, and is capable of mechanically, electrically, and thermally accommodating the A-DCS instrument as a payload. While ideally, the host spacecraft would provide all the interface characteristics identified in the attachment (instrument delivered as black box electronics), NASA is willing to entertain providing certain aspects as Government Furnished Equipment, in addition to the instrument itself (complete system provided by the government).  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. Instructions to Respondents: NASA/GSFC appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources including, but not limited to, NASA Centers, universities, university affiliated research centers, federally funded research and development centers, private or public companies, and government research laboratories. NASA-GSFC may contact respondents to this RFI, if clarifications or further information is needed. Multiple hosting opportunities that could be available to NASA/GSFC should be disclosed in the same submission. Mission requirements, interface requirements, and instrument characteristics are identified in the attachment. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for hosting the A-DCS as a payload would be beneficial, in response to this RFI. A ROM should indicate whether it is for the case where the instrument is supplied as an electronic black box and the host spacecraft provides all additional interfacing aspects, or whether it is for the case where the host spacecraft will accommodate all, and only, that equipment provided by the government (i.e., host spacecraft does not provide antennas, etc.). Respondents are also required to address the following programmatic items:  Company name, name of corporate point of contact, telephone number, full mailing address, and e-mail address.  Size of the company, number of years in business; affiliate information (if applicable): parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners.  Corporate competencies and past performance with regard to hosting payloads.  Past performance information which reflects the companys launches in the last five years. Please provide a brief description of the mission; the value of the action; if your company was the prime contractor or the subcontractor; and the point of contact information (POC) of the customer (name of the company/Agency, customers name, phone number, and email address) How to Respond:  Submit by January 17, 2014 by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)  Electronic submission is preferred.  Responses need to identify the primary mission of the hosting spacecraft, the planned minimum lifetime, anticipated launch date, orbit altitude, local time of the ascending nodal crossing, and state that it is a sun-synchronous orbit. The programmatic items shall be addressed in 10 pages or less, 12-point font size, one inch margins.  Respondents are welcome to submit supplementary information. Supplementary material may not exceed 10 pages.  Format for programmatic items and supplemental information: Microsoft Word (.doc) or Portable Document Format (.pdf).  Mark all responses: A-DCS Hosting Opportunities Submission All responses shall be submitted to: Kevin K. Carmack NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 420 Bldg L40: Rm N108 Greenbelt, MD 20771 E-mail: Kevin.K.Carmack@nasa.gov Questions and comments are welcomed. All questions regarding and correspondence associated with this RFI should be conducted by email. At this time, NASA is exploring the possibility of a future acquisition as a result of this RFI. It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Quotation, or Invitation for Bid. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3 titled Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes, and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI.	No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59 Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />NIMH performs clinical genetics research aimed at elucidating the genetic basis of mood disorders. NIMH recruitment efforts are now focused on special populations living in remote rural areas, many without telephone services. Enrollment requires travel to the homes of research volunteers to carry out consent and interview procedures in field, as well as familiarity with the cultural and language so that psychiatric information can be collected sensitively and reliably.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br />NIMH leadership position in the field depends critically on the formulation and execution of appropriate research volunteer ascertainment strategies, refinement of diagnostic procedures, and improvements in case definition. The existing resources of the Intramural Research Program and the expertise available are not sufficient to meet this need. Therefore the most cost-effective and efficient way to proceed is to assign these clinical research tasks to an outside contractor. This is the best way to maintain NIMH leadership position while working within present constraints.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />Businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contract Specialist. The capabilities statement must specifically address each project requirement separately. Additionally, the capability statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of pervious research projects that are similar to the project requirements in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program. The capability statement must not exceed 15 single sided or 7.5 double sided pages in length and using a 12-point font size minimum.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist-Snoddyj@mail.nih.gov in MS Word within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After reviewed of the responses received, pre-solicitation and solicitation notices may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. The solicitation release date is pending. The Government intends to negotiate a fixed-price contract.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - AFRICAP RE-COMPETE
<p>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management (AQM), is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis, as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for Africa's Multifunctional Peacekeeping Support Program, AFRICAP. This includes providing training and advisory services, equipment procurement, logistical support, maritime security, capacity building, operational deployment for peacekeeping troops, aerial surveillance, conference facilitation, and construction services to African countries (AFRICAP). The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement and will assist DOS in developing and further defining procurement, acquisition, and development strategies. This market research will identify potential small business sources (including 8(a) business development participants, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), HUB Zone small business concerns, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small business concerns and economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns). The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code assigned to this procurement is 561210 (Facilities Support Services).

Firms may be required to perform all or part of the following services: <br>  <br> A) Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment: Biological surveys for pallid sturgeon and other native fish species and habitat data collection will be conducted in accordance with the most current guiding documents for Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment and Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection. All data are recorded on standardized data sheets  <br> and followed by implementing a variety of QA/QC procedures. <br>  <br> B) Pallid Sturgeon Propagation: The Corps has the responsibility to work cooperatively with the USFWS to capture, hold and spawn broodstock annually.  The Corps is responsible for a portion of the annual stocking identified as the Average annual shortfall in the 2000 Opinion and 2003 Amendment to the 2000 Opinion. This component provides support for propagation and population augmentation activities associated with annual stocking goals for pallid sturgeon. Activities associated with pallid sturgeon propagation include:  broodstock collection, sexing, and <br> transport. An annual summary report that is in accordance with a standardized format will be submitted highlighting the propagation activities. <br>  <br> C) Aquatic Habitat Assessment and Monitoring:  For the benefit of pallid sturgeon, the Corps,through management actions or site-level projects, creates and then monitors aquatic habitat in the channelized segment of the Missouri River. The contractor will be responsible for assessing improvements/changes in the physical habitat characteristics associated with the channelized river,and the biological response to those habitat changes.  All data are recorded on standardized data  <br> sheets and followed by implementing a variety of QA/QC procedures. An Annual Report that summarizes each year's data collection efforts is required. The contractor is also required to attend meetings and trainings directly associated with assessment and monitoring activities; it is estimated that there will be five total occurrences.  All sampling must be consistent with the most recent version of the guiding document for Pallid Sturgeon Habitat Assessment and Monitoring,  <br> Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Project and Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures forFish Sampling and Data Collection documents. <br>  <br> D) Aquatic Ecosystem Response: This would include monitoring to assess the biologic response of native species including game and non-game species as well as changes to primary and secondary productivity that result from in-channel and off-channel aquatic habitat creation efforts. This data would provide the information needed to make informed adaptive management decisions related to habitat creation in order to insure recovery of the ecosystem on which the pallid sturgeon relies. <br>  <br> E) Scientific Studies: To support learning and progress towards recovery of the pallid sturgeon, certain research activities are required to improve understanding, identify relationships, and resolve knowledge gaps for pallid biology and ecology.  As the recovery process moves forward, priority information needs will be identified, some of which are included in the Ruckelshaus Report. Data collection and research study design and analysis may be conducted to address high priority information needs for pallid sturgeon in the middle basin of the Missouri River. These needs are identified, in part, under four categories Early Life Stages, Habitat, Reproduction, and Population Assessment. <br>  <br>  <br> This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest for firms to demonstrate a capability to perform the anticipated work.

<p>(11) Local and Enterprise Management- Involves collecting and distributing operational data to support operations both at an individual mess hall and at a given installation and providing management reporting for local, installation, and headquarters use.</p>
<p>(12) Software Accessibility- The Food Management system must be able to function consistently in peacetime, contingency, and war. MCFMIS shall be accessible from authorized computers that have access to the worldwide web. The Food Management system must allow for operations even when the web is not accessible at a site. Data and transactions should be capable of being submitted in real time via the Internet and also be capable of being "batched" at such times when the web is not accessible and transmitted when web access is again available. The Food Management system must also be able to automatically re-synchronize data and operations when connection to the web is re-established.</p>
<p>Marine Corps must feed its personnel in various environments and under diverse conditions during peacetime and war. These different scenarios represent the basis upon which requirements must be developed for a food management system.</p>
<p>a. Garrison feeding is characterized by the requirement to feed personnel either temporarily or permanently attached to a garrison mess hall. Garrison feeding must support cafeteria-style and, "meals to go." This scenario assumes that an established communications infrastructure is available to support system connectivity.</p>
<p>b. Field feeding is characterized by the requirement to perform food management functions for a unit that is away from its home base. Inventory management must include the ability to assign a Date of Pack, Lot Number and Date Product Expires to an operational ration inventory item upon receipt, issue, adjustment, transfer, or sale. A core assumption for this type of feeding is that connectivity is not available or not reliable, so feeding must be supported by a system that can operate locally. Examples of field feeding are deployments and mobilizations.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED</p>
<p>1) Provide the Computrition perpetual corporate license (source code access) with unlimited users for use of the software. The perpetual license will cover all enhancements/modifications to the Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) resulting from engineering changes and required interfaces.</p>
<p><br />2) Develop and integrate software extensions to the COTS software in order to provide required functionality not available "out of the box."</p>
<p>3) Establish, maintain and verify interfaces among all systems;</p>
<p>4) Provide a standard communication interface that satisfies the requirements of garrison and deployed sites, and can be used in conflict as well as peace.</p>
<p>5) Support any tool or software integrated with the COTS including maintaining current browser software, operating system software, and technology.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives listed above; (2) Commercial published product/labor categories and rates used by respondents for similar products/services (this does not count against the 10 page limit); (3) Citation of any current or past customers (i.e., within the past three (3) years) to include contract number, point of contact telephone number or e-mail address; (4) Link to respondent's General Services Administration (GSA) contract or attached file of same, if applicable (product and service must be 100% available from the offered schedule), and (5) other material relevant to establishing core competencies of the firm.</p>
<p>Response is due by 10:00 AM, EST on Thursday, January 9, 2014. Please submit e-mail responses to Carol Neely at e-mail address carol.neely@usmc.mil.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Medtronic Longitude II Spinal System which will be used in a lumbar interbody surgery at the WPAFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc., 1800 Pyramid Place Bldg A , Memphis, TN, 38132-1703. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Medtronic Longitude II Spinal System which will be used in a lumbar interbody surgery on 8 Jan 2014 at the WPAFB MTF. Medtronic is the only known source for this system which is required by the performing Surgeon to access the patient's spine percutaneously, decreasing the amount of blood loss during the surgery and decreasing the likelihood that the patient would die from blood loss during surgery. The Neuro spine surgeon has trained using these Medtronic implants and plating systems and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov

Satisfactory demonstration of this capability will support the requisite Material Release(s) for product fielding and may lead to an SRW-A fielding solution for Capability Set 15 (CS-15) and other DOD and Government requirements.     <br>  <br> The strategic goals for this operational evaluation are to document the performance baseline of the various SRW-A radios with regard to:  <br>  <br>     i.	Network management <br>    ii.	Interoperability considerations <br>   iii.	Equipment capabilities to include ease of use <br>  <br> Prior to participating in NIE 14-2 the SRW-A must:  <br>  <br> 1)  Have a minimum of one SRW capable channel.  <br>  <br> 2)  Have the ability to be endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect user voice and data to the SECRET level in time to participate in NIE 14.2.  <br>  <br> 3)  Have the ability to obtain a Safety Release in time to participate in NIE 14.2.  <br>  <br> 4)  Have the ability to obtain Spectrum Certification (DD Form 1494) in time to participate in NIE 14.2. <br>  <br> 5)  Have the ability to obtain Interim Authority to Test (IATT) in time to participate in NIE 14.2.  <br>  <br> 6)  Have the ability to provide as Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) approximately 25 each SRW-A to NIE 14.2 by 7 FEB 2014.  Five of these SRW-A are to be provided to the LBRR as soon as possible, and five of the SRW-A installation kits are to be provided for installation build by 10 JAN 2014.   <br>  <br> 7)  Have the ability to complete the PM provided NIE Request for Information (RFI) package by 15 JAN 2014 (package will be provided by PM upon request). <br>  <br> 8)  Have the ability to provide Field Service Support during NIE 14.2 preparation (to include LBRR, instrumentation development, Golden Vehicle Build, data products build, etc.) without the expectation of reimbursement by the Government.  As a minimum, a dedicated on-site Field Service Representative (FSR) would be expected during the NIE event from 15 FEB 2014 through 31 MAY 2014, as well as to provide engineering support for the CFE during all field preparation.     <br>  <br> NIE 14-2 is a time driven event and will occur regardless of the SRW-A test readiness.  The Government will make every attempt to conduct the Instrumented DA Directed Evaluation on all SRW-A variants which meet the eight NIE prerequisites listed above.  However, Test Readiness Reviews (TRR) will be conducted on each SRW-A.  Each SRW-A will gain entrance or be denied entrance into the SRW-A Directed Evaluation based on that product lines' TRR.  <br>  <br> All costs for both outbound and return shipment of the CFE will be at the participant's expense.  Arrangements for return shipment of the CFE will be made as soon as possible after completion of the NIE 14-2. <br>  <br> PM TR NIE POC for this action is Ms. Flora Marshall, flora.m.marshal.civ@mail.mil, (443) 395-1124.  <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. <br>  <br> Only UNCLASSIFIED information shall be included in any response. <br>    <br> Proprietary or business sensitive information provided in response to this announcement shall be marked appropriately, and it will not be disclosed outside the Government or its support contractors. <br>  <br> Companies interested in having their SRW-A evaluated during NIE 14-2 must notify the undersigned of their interest within two weeks of this notice.

<RESPDATE>020514
<ARCHDATE>02062014
<CONTACT>Christopher Glista, Mr., Email DARPA-SN-14-14@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office (CMO), intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation, 5600 W. Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />
<p>The proposed procurement is for a LRASM follow-on development effort that will continue maturation of the LRASM subsystems and system design that Lockheed Martin has developed under the current contract awarded in 2009 after full and open competition.  The follow-on effort will conduct further sensor and avionics hardware development based on previous results achieved under the current contract.  It will also provide for fabrication of missile hardware to enable additional missile flight tests.  The follow-on effort will be completed within twenty-four (24) months after contract award.  This effort will leverage substantial Government investments in development of the LRASM System.  Award to a source other than Lockheed Martin would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>This follow-on effort requires the ability to receive, store, and process classified secret material via a DoD-accredited security facility clearance.  The prime contractor's facility, and any subcontractor's facility that will be receiving, storing, and processing classified material, shall have secret facility clearance validated by active Commercial or Government Entity (CAGE) Code to store and processes secret material.  It is anticipated that the hardware and software developed under this follow-on effort will be classified at the collateral SECRET level.  Project managers and engineering personnel shall have, at a minimum, a SECRET clearance.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only.  It is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements of this follow-on effort by submitting a white paper and past performance data no later than 4:00PM EST, February 5, 2014 to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Christopher Glista, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 675 N. Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203 or via email to DARPA-SN-14-14@darpa.mil.  Questions shall be submitted to the above email address. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin directly.</p>
<p>The Government will consider all information received before 4:00PM EST, February 5, 2014.   Information received will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>It is also noted that DARPA maintains a Broad Agency Announcement seeking subsystem level technologies that enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military in four (4) general mission thrust areas: Ground Systems, Maritime Systems, Air Systems, and Space Systems.  Please see Broad Agency Announcement DARPA-BAA-13-22, "Innovative Systems for Military Missions," posted at www.fbo.gov.</p>

<DESC>Section 1: Low Cost Solar Array Technologies in Support of High Power Solar Electric Propulsion Spacecraft: Overview The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking to obtain information on innovative approaches to reduce the costs of space solar arrays through technology improvements. The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is twofold: first, to obtain feedback from industry regarding NASAs plans to solicit cost saving technologies as described below, and second, to solicit existing technology samples that would benefit from an early characterization by the Government on a no-cost basis. Areas of interest include (but are not limited to) modularization, automation, reduction in blanket/touch labor manufacturing, improved solar cell yields, reduction in testing costs, and synergy with the terrestrial photovoltaic industry. The approaches sought must be applicable for even moderate power levels (volume production cannot be the only factor to reduce costs). Business plans demonstrating high volume production of space quality solar cells to non-space markets are also sought. NASA intends to pursue overall cost benefits at the solar array level. All cost improvements should represent measureable benefits at this level and provide a pathway for development. Technologies can address recurring and non-recurring costs (manufacturing, test, and/or tooling) for flight units or development units. Low technology readiness level (TRL) technologies are encouraged but the transition from analytical and experimental proof of concept validation (TRL 2-3) to prototype testing in representative space environments (TRL 5-6) must be demonstrated within a three year timeframe. In a potential future request for proposal, cost benefits demonstrated at the panel level with a description of how those benefits will scale in ranges of 10kWs, 100kWs to 1MW with an anticipated schedule to meet each demand will be required. Information on how that would best be defined is requested as part of this RFI. NASA expects to provide a specific array design to be used by proposers to demonstrate the cost impact of their technology. Demonstration of a low risk of mission failure and high overall performance (i.e. specific power, overall conversion efficiency, low stowed volume, structural dynamics, etc.) must be comparable to current SOA space solar array designs. Technologies must be able to meet AIAA Qualification and Quality Requirements as per S-112A-201X. Eventual technologies must be suitable for space applications.	Approaches and proposed technology must be compatible with long duration NASA space missions. For an example, the technology must be operable in 100  300V circuits near the plasma exhausted from electric thrusters in a radiation environment driven by 300 day LEO to GEO transfer through the main proton belt (20x1014 1Mev e-/cm2). If concentrators are proposed, proposers must explain how the spacecraft will be impacted (i.e. gimbal, guidance, navigation and control system, costs of the concentrator, structure, flight mode, flight ops, power-EP-comm-nav) in terms of cost as well as in space environment tolerance, thermal design, thermo-mechanical stability, and array planarity. Examples of technologies sought (but not limited to) include:  Reducing the cost of a cell while not increasing the cost of the layup (e.g. reduced manufacturing costs for high efficiency cells, thin film or other technology with concomitant integration techniques),  Increasing the efficiency of a cell while not increasing the cost (e.g. improved manufacturing processes or photovoltaic conversion), or  Optimizing the number of cells (e.g. supercells or concentrators), or  Reducing the cost of the full set of CICed cells (e.g. improved methods for interconnects, coverglasses, coatings, etc.), or Reducing the non-reoccurring costs through component qualification testing, or Reducing the cost of the cell/blanket integration (e.g. modular panel designs, automated layup, etc.).  Section 2: Low Cost Solar Array Technologies in Support of High Power Solar Electric Propulsion Spacecraft: Response Introduction: Feedback from industry is sought on the above wording, particularly regarding what representative spacecraft and mission information from NASA would be of value to help showcase proposed technologies, and how best can NASA solicit business model and cost information from proposers to fairly assess system-level impacts of technologies affecting different aspects of solar array manufacturing and development. Respondents can submit information and relevant test samples in response to this RFI. Before the solicitation is released, NASA is extending an offer to consider independently characterize technologies that may be suitable for proposal.  Technologies would be provided to NASA at no cost to the Government, and NASA would provide test data of mutual interest to NASA and the proposer to provide early feedback about areas of particular interest to NASA.  A Space Act Agreement is the expected mechanism to document the test plans and deliverables, and can be initiated immediately. Request for Information: Responses must be submitted to: Amanda L. George, Contracting Officer NASA Glenn Research Center, MS 60-1 21000 Brookpark Road Cleveland, Ohio 44135 Amanda.L.George@nasa.gov Responses to this RFI shall be submitted in writing and electronic media postmarked no later than 5:00 PM EST on February 13, 2014.

The NAICS code for this procurement is: 811219 - "Other Electrical and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance".  These platforms support OEM's charge to install a novel laboratory analytical method for detection of 'Bacillus anthracis' from environmental samples in EPA's laboratories.

This is paramount to OEM's mission to restore an environment to ambient conditions.  Perkin Elmer is the manufacturer of this equipment and for proprietary reasons, they are the only company that can service and maintain the equipment.  During the course of market research, EPA has found no other contractor capable of providing such services.  If there are any other potential sources, please submit your capability statement via email to the US EPA, c/o Contracting Officer Elaine Scott at scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than 12 noon - EST Tuesday, December 24, 2013.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC><br />i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number associated with this requirement is BATF122013. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP)</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-70.</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110 and the business size standard is $30.0 Million (Offerors must have soliciting NAICS Code listed in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at the time of proposal submission. If not, proposal will not be considered). This requirement is a small business set-aside. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is not applicable.<br /><br />(v) See Attachment A - Supplies or Services and Prices/Rates for CLIN structure.</p>
<p>(vi) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has a requirement for hotel accommodations in Huntsville, AL. (as described in the Statement of Work (SOW at Attachment B).</p>
<p>(vii) ATF intends to award a Firm Fixed price Purchase Order. The period of performance will consist two (2) Months.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jul 2013) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Parties responding to this solicitation who believe they can provide the required hotel accommodations described herein may submit their proposal in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g., on company letterhead, formal quote form, etc.) and must include the following information: 1) company's complete mailing and remittance addresses; 2) discounts for prompt payment if applicable; 3) Dun &amp; Bradstreet number; 4) copy of System for Award Management (SAM) Registration (which may be accessed at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us); 5) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and; 6) pricing in accordance with the CLIN specified herein (see Attachment A- Supplies or Services and Prices/Rates) and; 7) technical response addressing capability to provide hotel accommodation in accordance with the requirements herein inclusive of past performance information with no less than three (3) references.</p>
<p>To aid in the evaluation process, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written, indexed/cross indexed, and logically assembled. Format requirements and page limitations are established to facilitate the ease of evaluation and to assist in determining whether Offerors are able to concisely communicate a clear understanding of the requirement in their proposed approach and capabilities. Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted nor evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 5," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number. Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to provide the requirements outlined in the RFP. Additionally, all offerors must submit copies of their Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Certification and State Fire Marshall's Safety Inspection along with proposal. If not, proposal will not be considered or evaluated. If the above information was recently sent in under solicitation BATF111213 for the similar requirement: ATF will accept that information. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>1) Lodging Accommodations/Amenities -The offeror must demonstrate the capability to successfully meet the required specifics and amenities as described in the SOW.</p>
<p>2) Site Visit - The offeror must be available to allow ATF Representatives entry into one or more rooms of the accommodations being proposed to fulfill the requirement. If an onsite review was done by the Government under solicitation BATF111213 for the similar requirement the Government will not do another On-site and the same information will be used unless the contractor can provide new information.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period. If past performance was recently sent in under solicitation BATF111213 for the similar requirement: if desire, ATF will accept those same references or new references can be submitted.</p>
<p>Past performance references must be as having provided hotel accommodations as a prime contractor on previous or current contracts that are similar in size, scope, and complexity as identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the Past and Present Performance Survey (Attachment C), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed surveys to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The surveys shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to james.huff@atf.gov.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.ppirs. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to five (5) one-sided pages, excluding certification documents, state fire marshall's safety inspection, past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST FIVE (5) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not include additional information as an attached appendix.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO PRICE/RATE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I.</p>
<p>The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE/RATES (non-rated)</p>
<p>ATF is seeking hotel accommodations for students and instructors attending explosives training for courses on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. The proposed rates must be at or below GSA's established per diem rates throughout the base and option periods of the contract.</p>
<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>A. Lodging Accommodations/Amenities<br />B. Site Visit<br />C. Past Performance<br />D. Price/Rates</p>
<p>Factor A through C are referred to as the technical factors. Factors A through D are in order of relative importance. Factor A through C (when combined) are approximately equal to price. As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination.</p>
<p>In awarding the proposed contract, ATF will select a contractor who presents the overall best value to the Government, considering the technical merit of the contractor's proposal. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the offeror submitting the lowest proposed prices/rates. It should be noted that award may also be made to other than the lowest proposed prices/rates if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to make an award on the basis of initial proposals without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best at or below GSA per diem prices/rates.</p>
<p>Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Technical proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>1) Lodging Accommodations/Amenities - The degree to which offeror demonstrated the<br />capability to successfully provide lodging accommodations and amenities as described in <br />the SOW.</p>
<p>2) Site Visit - The degree to which a physical visit to the proposed facility meets the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - The extent to which the Offeror's past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successfully providing the described accommodations. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts or references identified by offeror. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An offeror without a record of past performance for whom information on relevant past performance is not available will be evaluated as "neutral".</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price/rates for all options to the total price/rates for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices/rates are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2013). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via website at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us. A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Sept 2013), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Sept 2013), applies to this acquisition. In addition, the following clauses are also incorporated by reference to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_x] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [x_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_x] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [x_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[x_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The first<br />four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and the<br />four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local union<br />number or district council number where applicable , i.e.,<br />Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the example, is<br />an internal number used in processing the wage determination.<br />The date, 07/01/2011, following these characters is the<br />effective date of the most current negotiated rate/collective<br />bargaining agreement which would be July 1, 2011 in the above<br />example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rates.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union majority rates,<br />LA indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>

The contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days' notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p><br />7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide<br /> <br />8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include but is not limited to Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazard groups.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.<br />The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted Support Relief Group staff and provides information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG.  Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.<br />Activation of the SRG Shelter and Settlements Advisor will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG.  USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose.

(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).

SOLICITATION QUESTIONS & ANSWERS


1.	Under the Statement of Work, Description of services, para 2, it states approx 70 LAL and 136 colony counts per month.  Will these be collected on one day per month, one day per week equally divided or another schedule? This is important to know for us to provide the proper kit/supplies.
Answer: It will be intermittent. Some months there may be a collection done with one bulk shipment, other months in may in weekly collections averaging to 70 LAL and 136 colony counts per month. Current facility ships the collection devices in advance so that we are prepared for any scenario.

2.	Under the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice, it states vendor must also be fully accredited by the CAP and CLIA certified.
We are CLIA certified and that generally supersedes CAP. Will CLIA certification be sufficient for this contract?
Answer: No. We want both CLIA and CAP certifications, per Lab Manager.
3.	Under the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice, page 4, maximum allowable chemical contaminants, it lists " chloramines and free chlorine".
These are required to be tested at the clinic daily. These compounds will dissipate and disappear over time and if sent to the lab for testing will be inaccurate results.
Will chloramines and free chlorine be required to be tested by the lab?
Answer: Yes. These are requirments as established by AAMI standards.

<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) year, with four (4) option years</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Civilian Response (OCR) "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OCR supervisor according to requests made to OCR by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC solicitation. There is no obligation by OCR to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, OCR will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to OCR or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify OCR whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify OCR at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist OCR in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from OCR and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Overseas<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training program in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training and security training. After completion of appropriate training, the Democracy Officer - Elections will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Civilian Response (OCR) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, internal conflict or otherwise in need of surge staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, OCR provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo, and many other countries. As a member of OCR's team of crisis responders, you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.</p>
<p>USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to crises. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing yet timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. OCR plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs, OCR retains a group of high level professionals and experts under (USPSCs) as part of a "Firehouse". These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are rapidly available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, replace evacuated staff, or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. OCR staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach, reporting, and strategic planning, and others. As a member of the "Firehouse" you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This position calls for an experienced elections expert with the presence, knowledge and the leadership skills to serve for the Office of Civilian Response at select USAID Missions abroad.  The incumbent will be responsible to liaise with senior management officials at the State Department, the US Regional Missions, USAID/ Washington and with the U.S. Ambassador or his/her Representative, other agencies of the US Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad as well as senior local government officials. The incumbent must be skillful in determining the appropriate approach in negotiating and persuading others, and in establishing rapport in order to gain and relay information to key decision makers.  The incumbent may be responsible to visit program sites, outside the primary office setting and to act according to USG protocol and regulations.</p>
<p>The applicant should be a specialist in elections with experience in developing countries and post-conflict situations, related to the design documentation, management, negotiation, and coordination of elections and political processes, in areas including but not limited to election administration, electoral integrity, electoral and legal process reform, national dialogue and consensus building, civic and voter education, political finance, political competition, political violence, and political party development.</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>Acquisition &amp; Assistance Policy Directive (AAPD) No. 06-10<br />PSC Medical Expense Payment Responsibility</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC><strong><br /><br />Notice Type:<br />Modification/Amendment<br /><br /></strong><br />The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Insert the following topic area under I. <br /><br />Funding Opportunity Description:
<p>Specific Focus Area for FY14<br /><br />This topic announcement describes a research effort titled "Integrated Command and Control Analysis," to be executed under the Anticipatory Planning consolidated program for the Air Force Research Laboratory. The objective of the consolidated program is to provide commanders and planning staffs of future Air and Space Operation Centers (AOCs) with improved courses of action (COAs) development, analysis and selection capabilities to include means to explore plausible outcomes and recommend new options to take advantage of opportunities or avoid undesired events. The "Integrated Command and Control Analysis" effort(s) will support the overall program objectives by developing a configurable modeling, simulation and analysis tool/environment that is capable of executing various military operationally-relevant experiments, studies and "what if" tradeoffs to determine if a goal or effect can be feasibly met.<br /><br />The submission of proposals, their evaluation and the placement of research grants and contracts will be carried out as described in the Broad Agency Announcement.<br /><br />The FY14 focus area's background and award details are:<br /><br />The Air Force requires the ability to rapidly conduct integrated (air, space &amp; cyber) operational assessments of kinetic and non-kinetic effects. Current strategic planning capabilities lack automation to provide multiple COA options to operators. The complexity and spectrum of operations drives the need for mixed initiative (human/machine) decision aiding that enables comprehensive development of distinct COAs and vigorous analysis to a) determine if commander's intent can be met and at what cost and benefit, b) provide planning staffs with improved course of action development, analysis and selection capabilities to include means to explore plausible outcomes, recommend new options to take advantage of discovered opportunities, avoid undesired effects, etc., and c) evaluate existing or proposed Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and/or the effects of infusing emerging technologies into military planning/strategizing/execution.<br /><br />The primary objective of this procurement is to provide or develop a modeling, simulation and analysis tool/environment that is capable of executing various military operationally-relevant experiments, studies, "what if" tradeoffs, etc.; for example, conducting an assessment of the effects of employing a range of various strike options in an air interdiction mission, capturing the results, and ultimately conducting after-action (post-simulation) data reduction, analysis and presentation/documentation of relevant findings.<br /><br />A necessary secondary objective is that this delivered simulation environment should also be capable of being reconfigured/recomposed in such a way that it could support not only studies in one domain (for example, the air interdiction study proposed above), but in other, possibly quite dissimilar, domains of interest; for example, assessing the feasibility and benefits of employing swarms of UAVs for real-time ISR.<br /><br />For this procurement, demonstration of the conduct of experiments in two (2) different domains/use cases is required. Particular emphasis will be paid to the simulation environment's ability to be reconfigured to address a variety of questions in (possibly) different domains; with respect to level of extensibility, ease of integration, the degree of interoperability, the time and effort required for model integration and simulation set up time, and so on. The offerer should be prepared to discuss specific reconfiguration approaches that have been or will be employed (e.g., model integration/composition, parameterization, different interoperability protocols, integration techniques, <br />information infrastructures, data sources, etc.), as well as simulation setup (e.g., data and model selection, a Design of Experiments approach, etc.). Finally, inasmuch as the ultimate goal of an IC2 simulation environment is to investigate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrated</span> C2 COAs, the offeror should address and discuss the simulation design and implementation considerations for how such a combined/multi-domain simulation environment would enable experimentation of the concept of IC2 as a force multiplier; e.g., how one might generate and assess truly Integrated C2 COAs, built using options/assets from across the air-space-cyber domains, or trying to identify potential synergies that might arise by employing the right mix/timing of kinetic/non-kinetic alternatives, and so on.<br /><br />It is recommended that white papers be received by<strong> 31 Jan 2014</strong> to maximize the possibility of a 2QFY14 award. Awards will range from 6-12 months, with dollar amounts ranging from $250,000-$600,000. Please email your white papers to: <a href="mailto:Shelby.Barrett.1@us.af.mil">Shelby.Barrett.1@us.af.mil</a></p>

All questions regarding the Classified Appendix A MUST be submitted to: usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil.**  <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. Please see the attached document for full details.    <br>       <br>    The U.S. Army Communications, Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Command (CERDEC) Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is conducting this Request for  Information (RFI) to identify potential providers of a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection system for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft.    <br>        <br>    Purpose:    <br>        <br>    This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any response expenses.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government encourages teaming/partnering.  The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firm's participation in the future competition of a competitive contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential providers of a COMINT collection system with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 7 for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft.    <br>         <br>    Airborne COMINT System Description:    <br>        <br>    The Army has a critical requirement for a worldwide, self-deployable ISR capability that can immediately begin operations when arriving in theater and sustain long-term operations.  These capabilities: COMINT, Radar, and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), will provide the warfighter real time support to targeting, suppression of enemy air defenses, signal mapping, and support to small scale contingency (SSC) operations through the exploitation of enemy movers, sitters, and emitters.      <br>        <br>    The COMINT collection system is required to provide direction finding (DF), recognition, copy, and exploitation functions.  The system must function against both conventional and modern signals.  It must also provide data to comply with the requirements specified in the Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations Communications Intelligence Joint Interface Control Document Version 4.1 (Threshold) Released 1 June, 2010 (Version 4.2 Objective) to participate in Theatre Net-centric Geolocation (TNG).  The COMINT collection system must produce signal identification and target location accuracies sufficient to support target development, target tracking, and multi-sensor cross cue functions.  Multiple mission profiles must be supported.  The COMINT system must be controllable from 4 on-board operators using DCGS-A workstations and/or via remotely located workstations.  The system must provide a seamless interface to Operational Ground Station (OGS), current reporting networks, and to National data bases.  It must be highly reliable, easy to maintain, and have low sustainment cost.      <br>        <br>    All questions related to this RFI must be submitted to to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil.   <br>      <br>    All responses must be submitted to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil by 4:00 pm ET on January 31, 2014.    <br>        <br>    **Please see the attached document for full details**

The JBTDS is envisioned to be a lightweight, low cost, man-portable and battery operable capability set to detect, collect and identify biological pathogens and toxins in a tactical environment.  The primary system functions are to detect biological warfare agents (BWA), collect aerosol samples, identify the BWA in the sample, and alert personnel of the presence of a hazard.  The JBTDS detector/collector sub-system will provide visual, audible and networked warnings of the presence of biological agents and trigger sample collection.  The JBTDS identifier will identify the presence of biological agents and identify specific target species.   <br>    <br>  This effort will require the manufacture of BWA detection, collection, and identification hardware and software, consisting of the aforementioned capabilities linked together through a base communication system to allow real time detection from an independent location. Capabilities include: detector/collector, collector, identifier, and base station communications, each designed to function independently or together as one system. Requirements include the development and delivery of capabilities, engineering data, logistics products, and support to Government testing, training, and fielding.  Capabilities will be developed, tested, and purchased to support force protection needs, with the capability to adapt systems in multiple configurations/mission scenarios.  <br>    <br>  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. It is anticipated a combination cost plus incentive fee, firm fixed price, and cost type contract(s) shall be awarded to a single or multiple contractor(s). In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, the contractor's accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued on or about 6 Dec 2013.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.

All other instructions and information contained herein remains unchanged.*</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance FAR 15.201(e) and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. No funds are available to pay for preparation or responses to this RFI and no entitlement or payment of direct and/or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a vendor's submission of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI is for planning purposes only and any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet Agency requirements as stated herein. <br /><br />The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees, and their families. DeCA currently operates 248 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at $6 billion. Of that total, 178 stores are located within the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii, and 70 stores are located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products, services, and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons." It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide the military community with a great shopping experience; sustain a capable, diverse, and engaged civilian workforce; and be a model organization through agility and governance.</p>
<p>DeCA is in the process of updating the performance work statement (PWS) language for the delicatessen and bakery operations to ensure the requirement performance and goals align with the continued success of DeCA's mission, vision, and goals. DeCA's objective is to utilize industry expertise and best practices and seeks industry comments for the revised PWS language attached hereto.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DeCA requests industry comments on the following language and the feasibility of the pricing elements of the requirement criteria. <br /><br />DeCA is seeking a percentage of savings for each of the five product categories listed below. The amount expressed as a percentage of savings is what the offeror proposes to save the commissary patron on each item for the respective product category when evaluated against same or similar items from comparable commercial supermarket operations in a twenty (20) mile local commuting survey area of each commissary location. Offerors shall propose no less than a twenty (20) percent of savings, for each product category, for each CLIN, and corresponding sub-CLINs, as set forth in a potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. Pricing offered on a sub-CLIN shall be applicable to all locations covered by the CLIN.</p>
<p>Additionally, pricing of the one or more clusters of sub-CLINs offered from the potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES shall include labor, materials, overhead, and profit costs for the work effort required to operate and manage the contracted operations at the locations set forth in the schedule.</p>
<p>**NOTE** The following categories are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>Product Categories:<br />a. Random Weight: Bulk meats, cheeses and other items which are sold by weight and which require additional preparation and or packaging prior to being purchased by the patron. Examples include sliced deli meat, cold salads, salad bar, olives, etc.</p>
<p>b. Bakery: Includes breads, cakes, muffins, pies and other items which are either pre-packaged for immediate sale, or require some preparation from contractor personnel. Specialty items such as wedding cakes, sheet cakes, designer cupcakes, etc. are included in this category.</p>
<p>c. Ready to heat/ready to eat: Items which are prepared by vendor for immediate consumption by the patron, or which have already been cooked and can be reheated for use by patrons. Examples include rotisserie chicken, side dishes, meal solutions, sandwiches, soups, etc.</p>
<p>d. Sushi: Items which are primarily made up of cold rice dressed with vinegar, formed into any of various shapes, and garnished especially with bits of raw seafood or vegetables. Typically these items will be prepared in store, by trained personnel.</p>
<p>e. Non Random Weight: Items which arrive at the store pre-packaged by manufacturer require no additional preparation, for immediate purchase by patrons. These items usually have a manufacturer provided UPC code. Examples include imported, local and ethnic grocery like items.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to twenty-five (25) single-sided pages, Times Roman, size twelve (12)&nbsp;font, and one inch margins.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that a vendor has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, by the cut-off date, to the email address shown below.</p>
<p>The deadline for the receipt of questions and/or comments is the close of business (COB),&nbsp;February 25, 2013*. Written queries will be answered by the appropriate subject matter expert.

<p>The Agency's mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects. This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements. The Agency's Comptroller's Office requirements are equally diverse and unique.  DTRA is seeking interested sources capable of providing support to the DTRA Comptroller's Office in accomplishing it responsibilities for the overall preparation, execution and management of the Agency's resource portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>1.0	  BACKGROUND. </strong></p>
<p>The Comptroller Department, J8C, DTRA, has overall responsibility for the preparation, execution, and management of the Agency's resource portfolio.  Responsibilities are accomplished primarily through three Comptroller organizational entities, the Program and Budget Division, Financial Operations Division, and the Finance and Accounting Division.</p>
<p>The Program and Budget Division is responsible for, and provides oversight of, the Agency program and budget development, formulation, execution, and manpower resource requirements.  The Division provides primary DTRA program/budget interface/liaison with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) on program, budget, and execution issues.  The division is also responsible for justifying and defending resource requests at Department of Defense (DoD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Congressional staff budget hearings as directed.  The Program and Budget Division is responsible for implementing the Agency's corporate program review process to assure DTRA's programmatic needs are adequately provided for and resources allocated in accordance with strategic priorities.  In this capacity, the Division is responsible for preparing, consolidating, and submitting reports, memorandums, information papers, and budget briefings to the Agency's senior leadership for presentation to OUSD(C), DoD, OMB, Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Congress, as required, to defend the Agency's budget.  Additionally, the Program and Budget Division serves as Funds Manager for the Defense-Wide Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) accounts.</p>
<p>The Financial Operations Division provides direct financial management support to the Joint Directorates, which are the Agency mission organizations.  They provide a full range financial support including Programming, Budgeting, and Execution functions.  The Financial Operations Division is responsible for the development of the Joint Directorates portion of the POM based upon mission requirements.  They prepare justification materials, exhibits, spend plans, and provide budget execution support for all mission organizations. The respective Financial Managers within the Division provide direct support to their respective Joint Directorates and ensure their requirements are integrated into the Agency submissions.</p>
<p>The Finance and Accounting Division provides comprehensive financial services, financial reporting, managerial accounting, and financial systems support to DTRA.  The Division's functions include:  Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliance and financial reporting; Managers' Internal Control Program; management and funds control programs; accounts payable; accounts receivable; accounts maintenance; and reconciliation.  In addition, the Division provides centralized management, administration, and operation of all DTRA card programs in support of DTRA requirements worldwide.  DTRA card programs include the government-wide commercial purchase card (GCPC), centrally billed account, and individually billed account government travel cards.  The Finance and Accounting Division ensures that financial management at DTRA continues to produce accurate, timely, and useful financial information for DTRA.  The Division acts as the Agency's representative for all matters pertaining to accounting operations; financial improvement and audit readiness; financial reporting; and management control.</p>

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is the DAI Program Office for DoD.  DTRA went live with the Time and Labor capability in August 2011 and DTRA went live with DAI Financials in October 2011 (Oracle Financials Release 11.5.10).  DAI is now DTRA's accounting system of record.  An upgrade to Oracle Release 12 is planned to be completed in January 2015.

<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Opportunity: <br />Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to collaborate with LLNL and license intellectual property rights to pilot, deploy and commercialize LLNL's NeMS: Network Mapping System.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Background:<br />Network security is a significant need in today's interconnected electronic environment.&nbsp; With the rising adoption of cloud computing and virtualization, as well as the growing use of wireless and mobile devices for corporate business, organizations' networks are becoming increasingly complex and distributed.&nbsp; At the same time, organizations are facing ever-increasing complex security threats.&nbsp; To protect their network's integrity and availability, many organizations have invested heavily in security staff and technologies designed to identify, analyze and protect their computing infrastructure and network connections.&nbsp; Network mapping technologies can provide critical information about the organization's network to the personnel tasked with monitoring and protecting the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed network characterization and discovery tool called NeMS to address the problem of mapping Internet Protocol (IP) networks.&nbsp; The tool can help users achieve network situational awareness without requiring extensive network preparation or prior information and without compromising the security posture of the mapped network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Description:<br />LLNL's NeMS system enables network mapping operations by using two LLNL-developed software systems: LLNL's NeMS tool and the Everest visualization system.&nbsp; Each software system can be also used separately for their specific applications.&nbsp; When the two systems are used together as an iterative analysis platform, LLNL's NeMS system provides network security managers and information technology personnel with continuing network situational awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">The LLNL's NeMS tool is a software-based network characterization and discovery application. The LLNL's NeMS strives to produce a comprehensive representation of IP-based computer network environments. The LLNL's NeMS supports actionable intelligence and meaningful decision making by providing a view of the actual state of a computer network environment.&nbsp; Data discovered by the system can be stored, processed, viewed and analyzed by the appropriate information technology and security personnel.&nbsp; The final result of running LLNL's NeMS is a map of the target network environment.&nbsp; The LLNL's NeMS is designed and configurable to minimize disruptions and impacts on the target operational network and to require minimal intervention by network security staff. Similarly, LLNL's NeMS is designed to reduce the potential for overburdening the target network and should not affect the usability of the network services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">LLNL's Everest visualization system is a software tool for advanced graph visualization and analysis.&nbsp; Everest enables analysts to rapidly search, integrate, and gain insight from information that is stored in a variety of forms in pre-existing data sources.&nbsp; Everest's approach to modeling information allows new relations to be discerned in ways that aren't possible with traditional relational query techniques.&nbsp; For network security personnel, Everest enables users to view, search, and analyze the data from LLNL's NeMS or data fused to overlay logical network maps from LLNL's NeMS onto other information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Advantages:<br />LLNL's NeMS: <br />* Creates a scalable, detailed map of the target network environment<br />* Preserves the security posture of the mapped network <br />* Requires very little preparation or pre-existing understanding of the network<br />* Can be utilized from outside a firewall, or from one or more vantage points within a network<br />* Enables users to quickly query details of network entities, attributes, roles, and logical relationships<br />* Can automatically discover network features during mapping<br />* Can intelligently control its own operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Potential Applications:<br />LLNL's NeMS system can be used to generate a new network map of an IP network, corroborate or update existing network maps, or overlay logical network maps onto other information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Development Status: <br />LLNL's NeMS has been demonstrated on Class B networks (2 million IPs) and can be scaled up to Class A networks (&gt;16 million IPs).&nbsp;</p>

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

Again, the Government desires to receive pertinent information that will assist in defining our requirement, and does not desire to receive marketing material.

<DESC>This amendment is to announce the change in solicitation number of TSA's requirement for screening services at Orlando Sanford International Airport under solicitation number HSTS05-13-R-SPP011. The new solicitation number will be HSTS05-14-R-SPP004. It will be posted under that heading on www.fbo.gov. Please monitor FBO for the solicitation posting.<br /><br /><br />Description:<br />The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to solicit industry to provide airport Security Screening Services. Services include comprehensive screening of passengers and personal property at Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB), Sanford, FL. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this competition is 561612.
<p>The resulting contract term for SFB will be from the date of award for 12 months with four 12-month option periods. A detailed statement of work will be included in the solicitation. Comments or correspondence must be submitted in accordance with the information/instructions contained in the solicitation posting when it is released. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the Request for Proposal (RFP) and all attachments when posted. Some of the RFP attachments contain Sensitive Security Information (SSI). It is suggested that vendors follow the process below in order to gain approval for access to these documents early on in the process. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the FBO for the release of the solicitation and any amendments that may follow.</p>
<p>TSA intends to hold a pre-proposal conference. A draft Statement of Work is attached as Attachment 1 for reference during the visit. Please monitor the FBO website for further information.</p>
<p>Release of Sensitive Security Information:</p>
<p>A. Background.</p>
<p>Sensitive Security Information (SSI) may be available to offerors in preparing responses to this acquisition. Potential offerors must obtain specific authorization in order to obtain SSI. SSI will not be available or otherwise provided or disclosed to any person not specifically authorized to receive it. SSI provided under this acquisition may only be used to satisfy acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>B. Senior Corporate Official.</p>
<p>Each offeror (and subcontractor/team member) must separately designate in writing to the Contracting Officer a single, corporate official who will serve as the single point of contact for sensitive information. This individual must certify that all appropriate protections will be followed, only authorized individuals will have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. This official must also certify to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. A copy of this certification shall also be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov. This official will also ensure that the Contracting Officer is notified of staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information.</p>
<p>C. Offeror Responsibility.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will review the Excluded Parties List, Dunn and Bradstreet, and the System for Award Management to ensure that the corporate entity would not otherwise be precluded from receiving a contract award. While this review does not replace the responsibility determination required by FAR part 9, it may prohibit offerors from receiving SSI information during the solicitation phase of the acquisition.</p>
<p>D. Criteria for Release.</p>
<p>As part of this acquisition, SSI may only be accessed by individuals which have successfully passed a Security Threat Assessment. This assessment may include a verification of site facility clearance in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), contractor suitability determination or other federal background investigation, individual security clearance(s), and if required, a criminal history records check (CHRC) and/or a check against terrorism databases.</p>
<p>E. Information Requirements.</p>
<p>Consistent with the criteria release described above, offeror's Senior Corporate Officials must provide the appropriate information to the TSA as identified below. This requirement applies to any prospective subcontractor, joint venture partner, or "team" company whose access to the specified SSI and consequent input into the planned proposal is necessary to prepare and complete the proposal. All information must be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov with a carbon copy to Steven Galotti at Steven.Galotti@tsa.dhs.gov no later than 7/11/2013. TSA will not guarantee delivery of SSI to companies that submit their requests after 7/11/2013.</p>
<p>(1) Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the Contracting Officer via email with the CAGE code of the offeror's facility that will manage the proposal, company DUNS number, and address; and</p>
<p>(2) Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the following information for all employees who require access to SSI in a single password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet emailed to the Contracting Officer. The password for the password protected spreadsheet shall be sent to the Contracting Officer in a separate email, at the same time.</p>
<p>&bull; Employee Full Name:<br />&bull; Employee Gender: (i.e., Male or Female)<br />&bull; Employee Birth Date: <br />&bull; Employee Citizenship:<br />&bull; Social Security Number:<br />&bull; Indication of whether any nominated employees have:<br />&bull; Previously received a TSA suitability determination;<br />&bull; Undergone a federal background investigation; or<br />&bull; Possess an individual security clearance</p>
<p>F. Privacy Act Statement.</p>
<p>TSA will use the information provided to conduct a security threat assessment on individuals who seek access to Sensitive Security Information (SSI). The information will be shared within DHS with personnel who need the information to perform their official duties. Additionally, DHS may share the information with law enforcement, intelligence, or other government agencies as necessary to identify and respond to potential or actual threats to transportation security in accordance with the routine uses identified in the applicable Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN), DHS/TSA 002, Transportation Security Threat Assessment System (T-STAS). This SORN was last published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2005, and can be found at 70 FR 67731- 67735. Authority: 49 USC 114. Furnishing this information is voluntary. However, failure to furnish the requested information may delay or prevent the completion of your security threat assessment, without which you may not be granted access to the SSI.</p>
<p>G. Notification of Assessment.</p>
<p>If it is determined that covered individuals are not eligible to receive access to particular SSI based on the threat assessment, TSA will provide the individuals and company point of contact a written determination that provides notification that the individual does not qualify to receive SSI. Appeal of the determination will not be permitted due to the time sensitive nature of the acquisition process, however, the potential offeror may nominate another individual to receive SSI access. In the event that an individual is determined to be a security threat and the individual believes that the results of the screening are inaccurate, he or she will be informed by TSA on how to pursue redress from TSA, however due to the demanding acquisition schedule, TSA will not delay an acquisition to resolve redress issues.</p>
<p>H. Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>Each offeror employee requesting access to SSI as specified herein will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (DHS Form 11000-6). The executed forms shall be provided with and as part of the submission of information reflected in Paragraph E above. The Offeror should understand that employees granted access to SSI and signing a non-disclosure agreement are bound by the terms of that agreement indefinitely, notwithstanding their employment status or any other background checks or clearances granted by any Government agency.</p>
<p>Return of SSI. Any SSI provided to the offeror must be returned to the Government and verified by the Government prior to the beginning of proposal evaluations. Any offeror not returning SSI provided directly to them will be subject to penalties as prescribed by law and otherwise rendered ineligible for further consideration in the evaluation.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION The U. S. Geological Survey has a requirement for hydrological and meteorological equipment to be delivered to and installed in a remote location in Afghanistan.  There are currently other hydrological/meteorological stations installed in Afghanistan and this equipment must be identical to the stations already installed.  The installation must be performed in Afghanistan.  Providing and installing identical equipment is essential to the training experiences of the Afghanistan Minestry technicians and scientists in order for them to perform their duties.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.SC. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Sutron Corporation, and proposes to negotiate with that firm on a sole source basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms that can provide the equipment that is compatible with existing equipment and can provide the installation in a remote location in Afghanistan (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement no later than December 23, 2013.  An affirmative response would include a data inventory, literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this action.

All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing via email to the Contract Specialist as noted above. Anticipated Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are based upon the projected requirements for Southwest Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas.  Estimated value for this MATOC pool is $313,950,000.00.  This solicitation is one of four solicitations to be placed under the approved Acquisition Plan for construction within SWD and its surrounding areas. <br>  <br> SCOPE OF WORK:  Construction services are to include, but is not limited to: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  Anticipated execution of MATOC contracts are intended for new construction, design-build and design-bid-build facilities. In addition, to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.   <br>  <br> The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the Unrestricted MATOC pool with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $70,000,000.00 and a minimum task order limitation of $150,000.00.  The maximum combination of orders is $210,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of Unrestricted contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the Unrestricted MATOC contract is $2,500 which applies to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  <br>  <br> CONTRACT INFORMATION: This Unrestricted solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as  quote mark Offerors quote mark ) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task order at the time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   <br>  <br> The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: <br>  <br>  	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach    <br>  <br> 	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than Price (Volume 3).   <br>  <br> Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 14 February 2013 under solicitation number W9126G-13-R-0011.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 14 March 2013 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit, it will be conducted after the Phase 2 selection has been made.  Details regarding the Conference will be provided by amendment to the solicitation.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.     <br>  <br> MATOC:  Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505 Ordering and in accordance with the task order terms and conditions including the designated SOW.    All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.     <br>  <br> The total estimated contract capacity is $313,950,000.00.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.   <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER W9126G-13-R-0011 <br>  <br> The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract.

<DESC>Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the  quote mark One Door to the Corps quote mark  via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE UNDER CURRENT RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0011  <br>    <br>  Pre-solicitation Notice   Unrestricted Request for Proposal (RFP) for  Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.  <br>    <br>  The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Mr. Andrew Nelson at 817-886-1055, e-mail andrew.j.nelson2@usace.army.mil.  <br>    <br>  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 14 March 2013 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.

<a href="mailto:elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The New England District is acquiring an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Remedial Action Contract to support the District's work for United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the execution of the Superfund cleanup of New Bedford Harbor.   <br>  <br> The Request for Proposal will be solicited under full and open competition and unrestricted to business size; per FAR subpart 19.704 all large businesses will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan. The Total Acquisition Value (TAV) of the contract awarded under this solicitation will not exceed $350M and will have a 10-year ordering period with a 3-year base period, two 2-year option periods and three 1-year option periods. The work will be performed primarily at the New Bedford Harbor site, although the contract will allow for work at other sites requiring these services within the mission areas of the North Atlantic Division. The awarded contract will include cost reimbursable task orders. This will be a performance-based procurement. Specific outcomes will be defined in each negotiated task order. Task orders will be awarded up to the maximum capacity of $350,000,000.00. There is no limit of the number of Task Order(s) that may be executed, but in no case shall the sum of all Task Order(s) executed exceed $350,000,000.00. The Government is obligated to satisfy a minimum guaranteed amount of not less than $200,000.00 over the base period of the contract. <br>  <br> The primary work involves dredging, de-sanding dewatering, and disposal of sediments contaminated with PCBs. Other requirements include the operation of a water treatment facility, technical support including evaluations, cost analysis, studies, investigations, and other remedial actions as necessary. The remedial action at the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (NBHSS) is expected to take less than 10 years to complete based on the current annual funding levels. NBHSS operations are unique in both their complexity and scale. Highly contaminated sediment is precisely dredged and  pumped in slurry through de-sanding, dewatering and treatment processes with the end product being clean water and dry filter cake that is then shipped to an offsite disposal facility. Strict cleanup criteria will need to be achieved by the RAC contractor in accordance with the criteria established in 1998 Record of Decision (ROD).  There are very few projects in the country that present the challenges faced by the contractor working in New Bedford.  <br>  <br> The work under the solicitation involves providing all labor, equipment, materials, program/project/ construction management and engineering required to perform remediation of PCB contaminated sediment from the Acushnet River in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Remediation will be performed in accordance with the 1998 ROD and the four Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD).  This work includes sediment removal to cleanup levels, treatment and handling of the sediment and by products of processing of the sediment, transportation and disposal of contaminated material, maintenance, monitoring, and closure of Cell 1 (pilot CDF/Dredge Disposal Area), and monitoring of pilot cap area in the outer harbor. The work also includes remediation of wetlands and mudflat areas of the Acushnet River estuary. Proposed PCB disposal also includes construction of Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) cells to receive up to 300,000 cubic yards of untreated dredge material and will be performed under a separate contract.  The work performed under this solicitation may include disposal of some contaminated material in the constructed CAD cell.  <br>  <br> As part of the remediation activities, a rigorous environmental monitoring program of air and water contamination will be implemented.  Results from the environmental monitoring program are used to ensure compliance with performance standards and may be used in contamination modeling applications. <br>  <br> Please note this is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about January 13, 2014. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br>

<DESC>The Removable Spillway Weir in spillway bay 2 at Ice Harbor Dam is the primary passage route for downstream migrating juvenile salmonids. Biological tests and hydraulic models have shown that there is a potential for injury to some of the fish passing over the Ice Harbor spillway due to the steep slope and the abrupt transition to the surface of the existing spill deflector. To resolve this condition, the Corps is going to modify the spillway chute and the spill deflector in spillway bay 2 and add a new, permanent extension to the downstream end of the spillway pier between bays 2 and 3 at Ice Harbor Dam. <br /><br />The work will be accomplished by isolating the construction area from the tailwater in the stilling basin and dewatering the immediate construction area in spillway bay 2. Work on the spillway chute, deflector and the pier extension can then be accomplished in the dry. Some water leakage is usually present so pumping will likely be required throughout the construction period. <br /><br />The contractor shall remove approximately 100 cubic yards of existing concrete from the face of the spillway, leaving a roughened surface for placement of the new concrete forming the flatter spillway chute, new spill deflector, and the new pier extension. The removed concrete must be captured and not allowed to fall into the tailrace pool. Concrete anchors shall be drilled and grouted into the face of the spillway followed by installation of reinforcing steel. Concrete formwork shall be installed, and concrete for the spillway chute, the spill deflector, and the pier extension placed. Volume of new concrete required is approximately 1,200 cubic yards. All seepage water and other water from construction operations shall be removed from the work area for settling or other appropriate treatment. Should the need arise to spill water during construction; any support barges outside of the work area must be removed. Depending on levels of spill, construction may continue since the construction area would be isolated from the river. If spill is high, then it is likely that work will be suspended for safety reasons. <br /><br />Work must be accomplished during an extended in-water work window on the Snake River between November 1, 2014 and 28 February 2015. All new concrete must be placed by February 16, 2015 to allow sufficient time for it to cure completely to allow biological testing before court-ordered seasonal spill begins early in April of 2015. <br /><br />The construction magnitude is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. 100% performance and payment bonds will be required. NAICS code for this project is 237990, and the small business size standard is $33,500,000 average annual receipts. <br /><br />Solicitation is open to both small and large business concerns. Solicitation No. W912EF-14-B-0003 will be posted to the FBO website on or about December 5, 2013. The bid opening date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued. <br /><br />ACCESS FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS: Security clearance for foreign nationals to attend a site visit requires approximately 4 weeks; therefore, clearance should be requested immediately. To request clearance, please submit the names of all foreign nationals proposed for site visit attendance, along with documentation to verify that he/she was legally admitted into the United States and has authority to work and/or go to school in the US.

<AWARDEE>Creative Computing Solutions, Inc., 1901 Research Blvd, (Suite 600), Rockville, MD 20850-3292 US
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1) and as instructed by FAR 8.405-6(a)(2), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is publishing this notification to industry of a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Task Order award supported by a limited sources justification. On December 9, 2013, CBP issued a Firm Fixed Price Task Order under the General Services Administration (GSA) Mission Oriented Business Integration Services (MOBIS) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract, Special Item Number 874-1 to Creative Computing Solutions, Inc. (CCSi). CBP awarded Task Order Number HSBP1013F00012 on a sole source basis to CCSi as the incumbent contractor to obtain follow-on Biometric Watch-list analytical support services for a short duration period of performance from December 9, 2013 through May 23, 2014. <br /><br />This is a limited sources acquisition under FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) which states, in pertinent part, that an ordering activity may be justified in limiting sources of supply when "[o]nly one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized." 48 C.F.R. &sect;8.405-6. Award of a follow-on task order to any source other than the incumbent in this case would result in cost inefficiencies and create unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements. Any cost efficiencies reasonably expected to be gained through competition would be lost in the transition period to a successor contractor, particularly given the short duration of the proposed follow-on task order. Since the government proposes only a six (6) month period of performance for this follow-on task order to afford an opportunity to complete its hiring actions and federalize this work, CCSi as the incumbent is the only source reasonably available that is capable of providing continued Biometric Watch-list support services to CBP for the follow-on task order. A sole source award to the incumbent is the most efficient and economically viable option to ensure the government will receive continued Biometric Watch-list support services at the level of quality required without disruption or delay while the government transitions this work to federal employees. <br /><br />Under this task order, the contractor shall provide Biometric Watch-list research and analysis support services to assist CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) personnel with maintenance of the DHS Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) database. Contractor personnel shall also assist CBP Officers in coordination and liaison activities with other government agencies concerning foreign nationals applying for U.S. immigration benefit or otherwise seeking legal admission into the United States. Contractor personnel shall further assist CBP personnel in research, analysis and information sharing with other government agencies and the National Intelligence Community on matters pertaining to individuals seeking entry into the United States whom are of National Security interest.&nbsp; In performing these support services, contractor personnel shall have access to, and be proficient in the use of, several disparate systems and databases.&nbsp;

The altitudes routinely flown by JBLM aircraft operating within the TTFTA are from the surface to 300 feet Above Ground Level.  A WAM system overcomes the radar limitation of terrain obscuration by utilizing a network of aircraft surveillance sensors installed within and in the vicinity of the area in which surveillance coverage is required. The JBLM WAM system will consist of interrogator/receiver remote units, receiver only remote units, target processor(s), remote control and monitoring display terminal, external communications ports, and aircraft target displays at both JBLM Range Support and GAAF AIC. This effort includes a site survey, purchase of equipment composing the WAM system, installation of the system, and training.    <br>  <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers award is for the Repairs to East Jetty, Point Judith Harbor, Narragansett, RI. The work of this project consists of repairing the East Jetty at the Point Judith Harbor of Refuge, Narragansett, Rhode Island.  Repairs involve mobilization and demobilization, and the furnishing, delivery, and placement of new stone to replace stones displaced during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, and to fill in existing gaps and low points along the jetty.  The repairs shall be performed to restore the southerly portion of the East Jetty to the original profiles and cross-sections.  Repairs will require substantial moving and manipulation of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement.  Mobilization of equipment and rehabilitation of the jetty may require a combination of land and marine construction methods and resources.  When work is to be performed using marine construction methods, the Contractor shall do so by using its marine plant and barges only on the channel side of the jetty.  <br> 	Optional bid work consists of providing a new concrete foundation for the US Coast Guard's navigation tower.  The installation of the new concrete foundation will require removing, moving and manipulating existing stones to obtain the required depth for the placement of the new concrete foundation.  Resetting of stones around the concrete structure shall be such that stones maintain a minimum interlocking with at least three edge surfaces having a friction contact with at least three different adjacent stones.  Also optional work consists of removing the existing navigational aid structure from its base (a large stone), and setting it aside for pick up by the USCG.  All existing bolts that remain in the base stone shall be cut and filed flush with the stone surface.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. quote mark   See the Limited Sources Justification posted to this announcement for further information.   <br>  <br> The Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM) Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) contract will provide JBLM Range Support and Gray Army Airfield (GAAF) Airspace Information Center (AIC) real-time displays of cooperative aircraft position, altitude, discrete transponder code, speed, and bearing while the aircraft are operating at low altitude in the JBLM Tactical Terrain Flight Training Area (TTFTA).  The altitudes routinely flown by JBLM aircraft operating within the TTFTA are from the surface to 300 feet Above Ground Level.  A WAM system overcomes the radar limitation of terrain obscuration by utilizing a network of aircraft surveillance sensors installed within and in the vicinity of the area in which surveillance coverage is required. The JBLM WAM system will consist of interrogator/receiver remote units, receiver only remote units, target processor(s), remote control and monitoring display terminal, external communications ports, and aircraft target displays at both JBLM Range Support and GAAF AIC. This effort includes a site survey, purchase of equipment composing the WAM system, installation of the system, and training.    <br>  <br>
