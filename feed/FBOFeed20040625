<DESC>CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) is planning to construct Low Activity Waste (LAW) treatment and immobilization systems to supplement the capacity provided by the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) to treat nuclear waste from the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington.  Aqueous waste retrieved from single-shell saltcake tanks and double-shell salt slurry tanks may be classified as low-curie, medium-curie, or high-curie, depending on the activity of radionuclides (primarily 137Cs) in the retrieved waste.  Low-curie waste may be routed directly to the supplemental LAW systems, and high-curie waste may be routed directly to the WTP feed tanks.  Medium-curie waste may be routed to a Pretreatment System capable of separating the medium-curie waste into two or more streams, one of which would become the high-curie feed to the WTP, and one or more of which would become the low-curie feed to the supplemental treatment systems.  The objective of the anticipated subcontract is to provide technical and engineering feasibility, laboratory-scale performance, and design information for the Pretreatment System.  
The solicitation will result in the award of one or more subcontracts that will be awarded in two consecutive phases.  The objective of Phase I is to provide a Pretreatment System supported by laboratory-scale data and associated computer modeling. This work will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a Pretreatment technology capable of performing the separations using simulated Hanford tank waste.  Selection of the technology is up to the Subcontractor, however 137Cs ion exchange has been adequately dealt with elsewhere, and is not a candidate technology under consideration.  

The objective of Phase II is similar to that for Phase I, but the laboratory testing will be done using actual Hanford tank waste samples.  Additional development of the concepts introduced in Phase I will also be expected.

In order for a company/team to be eligible for participation in this procurement, the following minimum qualifications must be met:

•       The company/team must be able to describe a vision of a potential Pretreatment System capable of performing the separations described above.  The Pretreatment System must be capable of being deployed without the need for any new major capital equipment at the Hanford Site.
•	The company/team must have laboratory facilities capable of performing the testing and analyses required to demonstrate a Pretreatment System flowsheet, along with a certified QA program for the laboratory.
•	The company/team must include the capability of receiving and testing highly radioactive Hanford tank waste samples.
•	The company/team must include the capability of performing computer modeling of the Pretreatment System flowsheet using the Environmental Simulation Program by OLI, Inc. ®

Companies who meet the minimum qualification criteria may request a copy of the solicitation by sending an email to Karyn_E_Garvin@rl.gov citing Solicitation Number 112608.

It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal for the Medium/Low Curie Waste Pretreatment Alternatives Project will be posted to CH2M HILL's Procurement website http://www.hanford.gov/chgcp/ on approximately July 23, 2004.

<DESC>The Air Force intends to negotiate with Faulkner USA, LLC, on a sole source basis for the privatization of an additional 643 units of military family housing at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.  Estimated Transaction Closing: 1 Mar, 2005.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with Faulkner USA, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 420 residential units at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. NO DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be 1 Sep, 2004.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely available from only one source, because only the current privatization developer is able to satisfy the agency’s needs. An attempt to compete this requirement would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition, and unacceptable schedule delays in eliminating substandard housing.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer, must be able to demonstrate in writing, by 1 Aug, 2004, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack of priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information received. A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted at web address www.eypsc.com on or about 1 Sep, 2004.    It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described real estate transaction contact with the incumbent developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any submissions, is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

<RESPDATE>070104
<ARCHDATE>07312004
<CONTACT>Phyliss Schlegel, (609)485-4380
<DESC>Description of Requirement:  The Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Ground Facility (LGF) requires valid ranging source error estimates for all Global Positioning Service (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) satellites in view within a specified reception area.  Error estimates from a prototype LGF have been provided to the LAAS specification team in order to validate of the requirements of the specification using a dual-port L1 only antenna design.  While the dual-port design is effective, it requires additional receiver hardware.   A simpler broadband (L1/L2/L5) single-port design with reduced siting constraints would benefit the LAAS program by reducing the complexity of the validation prototype.  A review of the literature shows a number of antennae that have been proposed and built with these design goals, but, to date, none have proven feasible.  BAE Systems has independently researched and developed an antenna design that potentially will provide reception on multiple frequencies, with a large desired to undesired ratio reception pattern and low-error GPS measurements.  If the design concept proves successful, LTP data collection and operational capabilities will be greatly expanded. Antenna Requirements:  The prototype antenna shall: Â·	Be capable of receiving GPS signals on L1, L5, and L2 within the reception mask specified in FAA-E-2937A. Â·	Provide the received signals on a single antenna port for all elevations between 5 and 90 degrees. Â·	Provide a desired to undesired amplitude ratio for single reflection ground-induced multipath of at least 30dB for elevation angles between 5 and 35 degrees. Â·	Provide an omni-directional azimuth gain pattern, Â±1dB, as a function of elevation. Â·	Provide the signals without any azimuth dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding Â±1cm. Â·	Provide the signals without any elevation dependent group or phase delay variations exceeding Â±1cm. Â·	Provide the signals utilizing multiple right-hand circularly polarized antenna elements. Technical Approach:  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, assembly and demonstration shall be conducted in two separate phases.  The first phase is assembly and proof of the basic properties of the reception element.  The second optional phase will include assembly and testing of a complete prototype antenna array.   Performance verification shall consist of controlled laboratory tests, antenna test range measurements, and reception of the live GPS SPS constellation.  The FAA will conduct validation testing. The contractor must have in in-depth understanding and expertise in antenna design and manufacturing and be a recognized leader in the aviation community for aircraft safety by:  serving on thefully cognizant of FAAâ€™s research and development activities and objectives for this type of equipment.  participating in aircraft safety related conferences (e.g. Aging Aircraft Conference) as a speaker, chairman, and or a member of the organizing committee.In addition, the contractor must have the infrastructure in place for this work including all equipment and manpower.  This includes, but is not limited to:access to resources and facilities to perform all research tasks. Based on review of the literature and current knowledge of the industry, BAE Systems is considered to be the only source with the requisite design and technical capabilities.   A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your company does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of requisite capabilities, equipment and experience in providing similar research service for FAA to evaluate.  All responses to this announcement must be in writing and directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than close of business Thursday, June 30, 2004.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Schlegel by fax at 609.485-4088 or by e-mail at: phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov.

Background and sole source justification: The Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport originally purchased 17km length of submarine cable from NSW of Nordenham, Germany under contract N66604-02-C-5534 for the AUTEC Minefield and Shallow Water Range (AMSWR).  Since that award, the project was cancelled.  Due to the unique nature of the cable, NSW designed and built a specific cable pan to ship the cable.  Since the Government does not possess any designs or specs for a cable pan of this type, it must now procure the cable pan from NSW to continue storing the cable appropriately.  A Firm Fixed Price purchase order is anticipated. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items will be utilized for this acquisition. A request for quote will be issued 28 June 2004.  Anticipated award date is 07 July 2004. Delivery is FOB Destination, Newport, RI on date of award. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All other timely offers will be considered.  Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the following: NASA Langley Research Center currently owns the original Terahertz NDE system that was used for the research and development of the Terahertz NDE of SOFI on the External Tank.  This equipment was used in the Return to Flight program to assist in verification and certification of the method at Lockheed Martin Michoud, New Orleans, LA.  As a result of that work, several significant improvements were developed for future systems. Improvements were developed for the measurement rates, volume of data, the signal to noise levels, sensitivity, and probe configurations.  We need to make those improvements on our system if we are to continue supporting the External Tank office. The required tasks include:  1.	Upgrade the T-Ray 2000 system. Includes upgrade of the control unit, umbilicals (4), 2 THz heads, and 3 THz. 2.	Procurement of a new THz transceiver 3.	Upgrade T-Ray 2000 system to add spinner to system while still allowing the use of shaker 4.	Consulting for one day for a Picometrix employee to repack for shipment to Langley from Michoud the T-Ray 2000 system, plus travel expenses. 5.	Consulting for one day for a Picometrix employee to install the T-Ray 2000 at Langley. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Picometrix Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, the only known source that commercially manufactures terahertz equipment for industrial NDE.  The Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 6.302-1. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Non-linear Combustion Instability Model. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) by the authority of FAR 13.106.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The University of Tennessee’s Space Institute, UTSI developed a non-linear liquid rocket engine instability analytical model based on a similar model developed for solid rocket motors.   The work proposed here is an extension of current work to more fully develop this model to liquid rocket engines (add more of the appropriate physical models).  The current research uniquely qualifies UTSI as the only known researchers applying this particular technique to liquid rocket engines that is known to MSFC at this time.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 9, 2004.

Hanscom Air Force Base anticipates issuing combined synopsis/solicitation to provide and install a closed circuit camera system.  We are seeking potential sources for this acquisition.  The Government anticipates setting this acquisition aside exclusively for small business. A combination of existing cameras and new equipment will serve to monitor approximately 21 rooms, a common area, and external locations.  Each location will have a minimum of two cameras for approximately 43 cameras. These will feed images to monitors located at the reception area.  Each monitor will need to display the image from 2 or more cameras. The exact location and number of cameras will be established when the RFP is released.  Two additional monitors will be capable of receiving images from any of the cameras.  The minimum image size and resolution has been directed by laws and military regulations governing childcare and education centers.  That information will be provided as part of the RFP process.  It will be necessary to install the system when children are not present, generally during evenings and weekends.  The system will be installed at the CDC on Hanscom AFB 01731. The Government anticipates a firm-fixed-priced contract.  If it appears the installation portion will exceed $2,500, the Service Contract Act and Service Contract Act Wage determination will be incorporated into the solicitation.  Delivery time for the installed system will be a factor in the source selection process.  The NAICS for this acquisition is expected to be 561621, with a size standard of $10,500,000.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The National Association of Mental Health Planning and Advisory Councils , Alexandria, VA..  
Purpose:
Federal activities in support of mental health planning and advisory council services were substantially reorganized as a result of the passage of the ADAMHA (Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration) Reorganization Act, Public Law (P.L.) 102-321, enacted July 10, 1992.  The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is now the primary Federal organization concerned with State and community mental health planning.  Significant in this transition is that the former ADAMHA block grant to the States is now distributed in two separate block grants to include one for substance abuse services and one for mental health.  The mental health services block grant is now administered by CMHS.  The comprehensive community-based State mental health planning and advisory council requirements originally were promulgated under P.L. 99-660, amended in PL 101-639, and reauthorized in P.L. 106-310. The Law requires the establishment of a Mental Health Planning Council (MHPC) in each State and Territory.  The MHPC is mandated to: (1) review the State application for block grant funding; (2) serve as advocates for adults with a serious mental illness (SMI) and children with serious emotional disturbance (SED); and (3) monitor and evaluate the State mental health system.

The State Planning and Systems Development Branch of CMHS is responsible for the administration of the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant.  In this capacity, the need arises for the Branch to provide necessary technical assistance to States in several areas, including the submission of application for block grant funds, the implementation report, the development of mental health plans for providing comprehensive community-based services to adults with SMI and children with SED, the establishment and empowerment of the States= Mental Health Planning and Advisory Councils, the development and use of data, the development and use of performance indicators, and planning for changes in the health care environment such as systems integration to address the Olmstead Act and managed care, which will impact the community mental health system.  

There is a continuous need for the type of technical assistance proposed due to the constant turnover in membership on mental health planning and advisory councils.  There are currently several States and Territories that have requested technical assistance and indicated to CMHS that without such technical assistance, they will be unable to adequately carry out the functions required by the law.  Such functions, which include advocating for individuals with mental illness and monitoring and evaluating the adequacy of mental health services within the State.  Technical assistance enables councils to respond to the rapid changes to the health care environment that are impacting the community mental health delivery systems in their States.

Providing this critically needed technical assistance is imperative to the mission of the Division of State and Community Systems Development.   The State Planning and Systems Development Branch has lead responsibility for assisting States in the development of their community based systems of care through the administration of the Community Mental Health Services block grant.  P.L. 106.310 requires that CMHS to provide technical assistance to mental health planning and advisory councils, which is the only vehicle for involvement of key stakeholders in the development of State plans for implementing community based systems of care for persons with mental illness in the States.  Although the formation of State mental health planning and advisory councils is federally mandated, financial support of the council is not.  Therefore, the majority of the planning and advisory councils do not receive a budget from the State mental health authority and are unable to procure technical assistance without help from the Center for Mental Health Services.  It is, therefore, imperative that CMHS provide this technical assistance in a timely manner to States in order to effectively comply with the requirements of the law.  Given the fact that many States are experiencing rapid changes in the health care environment, planning councils need to be knowledgeable of the State mental health system to the extent that they can advise the State, which is an important mandate of the Block Grant statute.  Without technical assistance to planning councils, the CMHS mission would be seriously impeded.  
NAMHPAC is the only possible provider of the required services for the following reasons: 

It is the only organization which actually represents the target audience for the products of the procurement;
It has unique knowledge of the needs of mental health planning and advisory councils and their members;
It has unique knowledge of the types of information in which members use and respond to as they participate in their mandated state planning and advisory council activities;
It has the capacity to maintain an accurate and up to date list of the names and locations of rapidly changing mental health planning and advisory councils members needed to conduct required follow up;
It has established mechanisms for communicating with the mental health planning and advisory councils and their members;
Its technical assistance mission is to provide the very information CMHS seeks to have provided under this procurement, thereby creating an efficient and effective vehicle for performing the required work; and
The National Association of Mental Health Planning and Advisory Councils (NAMHPAC) is uniquely qualified to provide the services and delivery the products required.
NAMHPAC directors have been involved with CMHS officials for years in conducting peer-to- peer technical assistance to state mental health planning and advisory councils.  NAMHPAC directors have for years been engaged with CMHS officials in discussions regarding how the Association can accomplish its mission by assisting CMHS in synthesizing and disseminating information products that relate to mental health service delivery topics that address critical areas which must be acknowledged in state mental health service plans required under the community mental health block grant.

<DESC>A--Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study - Continuation of Community Surveillance, Laboratory Studies, and Morbidity and Mortality Follow-up.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, University of Mississippi, University of North Carolina,  Baylor College of Medicine, and University of Texas Health Science Center for a five year extension of contracts for continuation of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (the Coordinating center, the four Field Centers and the Central Lipid and Central Hemostasis Laboratories.)  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Since 1987, these centers have recruited, examined and followed a cohort of 15,892 persons aged 45-64 and conducted surveillance of 315,000 persons residing in four U.S. communities (Forsyth County NC, Jackson MS, suburbs of Minneapolis MN, and Washington County MD) in a study of both atherosclerotic disease risk factors and community trends for coronary heart disease.  The extension of these contracts will  include annual telephone follow up of study participants, cardiovascular event ascertainment for both study participants and all other age-eligible community residents, and laboratory studies of frozen biological samples from study participants, each of these three components requiring full comparability with the on-going study. Cardiovascular event validation will involve obtaining and reviewing hospital discharge lists, medical records, death certificates, physician questionnaires and interviews with survivors, and diagnostic classification using standardized reviews and adjudications.  Laboratory studies, aimed at identification of new biochemical and genetic risk factors, will require maintenance and monitoring of the blood, urine, and DNA sample repositories located in four of the centers.  Analysis and publication of new and already collected study data will continue.  The incumbent contractors have the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for continuation of this study.  Interested respondents must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a Request For Proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) proposes to procure approximately 275 Tactical Aircraft Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC) Advanced Memory Units (AMU) and 235 Mounting Plates.  The production support element of this procurement will include, but is not limited to, engineering investigations, engineering change proposals, integration and testing, spare and repair parts, engineering technical support, obsolescence analysis and redesign, and integrated logistics support.  The contract will be awarded on a sole source negotiated basis to Smiths Aerospace Inc., Electronic Systems, Grand Rapids, MI and will consist of a base award with option units.  These options will include approximately 689 AMU’s and 546 Mounting Plates planned for the procurement over the remaining 3 years.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded by Jan 2005.  Smiths is the sole designer, developer and supplier of the AMU and its Mounting Plates and is the only company with the necessary knowledge, technical data, equipment and experience and is the only source able to satisfy the government's requirements for TAMMAC AMU production installations into F/A-18E/F/G, AV-8B and UH-1Z/AH-1Y aircraft.  Delivery is required to the aircraft manufacturer and will be required within 12 months of contract award or option exercise.  This synopsis is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement has extended the existing contract USZA22-98-D-0001 with the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office for CY05, CY06, and CY07.  This announcement identifies USSOCOM’s intent to negotiate CY05 Time & Material (T&M) labor rates on a sole source basis with Bell-Boeing to exercise the 8th Option period of performance for the existing contract USZA22-98-D-0001 from 1 January 2005 until 31 December 2005 or if more convenient, issue a new contract.  The CV-22 is a Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps. Bell Helicopter and Boeing Space and Missile Defense Systems, Helicopter Division were competitively selected to jointly develop and produce the V-22 and its variants.  The Department of the Navy is funding the R&D costs for the CV-22 up to an agreed to ceiling.  USSOCOM is funding the remaining capabilities needed to meet the Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD) for SOF requirements. The CV-22 program often involves making a choice between competing functional systems being developed for other aircraft platforms.  The selected system must then be integrated into the CV-22 design, tested, incorporated in production planning/retrofit, and supported by the CV-22 logistical concept.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that Bell-Boeing is the only source capable of evaluating candidate solutions against the evolving CV-22 development baseline as it progresses from Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review (CDR) and production decision in FY 05.  In order to ensure that needed CV-22 performance capabilities are available to meet SOF operator requirements, detailed trade studies and analysis must be accomplished well in advance of the production program.  Therefore, it is imperative that USSOCOM have the capability of contracting with Bell-Boeing, the sole developer of the CV-22 system, to conduct trade studies and analysis of baseline/advanced CV-22 systems/sub-systems. The results of these efforts will support the process for maintaining and modernizing the CV-22 by scoping the efforts required to rapidly and efficiently implement critical improvements, conduct trade-offs, evaluate emerging technologies and continue to develop and maintain the long term modernization roadmap for the CV-22. This contract will also continue tactical simulation efforts begun in FY97 and enhance its operational realism and functionality.  The tactical simulation support allows AFSOC aircrews to develop tactics to employ the CV-22 aircraft on SOF missions.  The hybrid characteristics of the CV-22 (hover like a helicopter/fly like a fixed wing airplane) provide the user with new capabilities and approaches to execute mission scenarios. The SOF mission differs greatly from the USMC generic ship-to-shore mission. The long range, clandestine, infiltration/exfiltration mission accomplished in adverse weather under a single period of darkness requires specific tactics to ensure aircraft survivability and mission success.  These tactics need to be developed and validated so crews can be trained and mission capable when CV-22 operational aircraft are delivered. The contractor has already developed a simulator and will continue to maintain a CV-22 cockpit to a sufficient level to evaluate tactical advantages. The contractor shall maintain the tools necessary for special operations forces (SOF) crews to conduct mission simulations and evaluate systems performance. The simulator will be upgraded by the contractor to incorporate a new visual system to improve its fidelity.  The simulator will include an operationally realistic environment that will allow aircrews to adequately assess the functionality of the CV-22 design. The contractor shall support the development and documentation of operational/tactical requirements through the prototyping of alternative aircrew-aircraft interfaces and the evaluation of those alternative interfaces through pilot-in-the-loop simulation.  A preplanned product improvement (P3I) program which will integrate USSOCOM SOF unique capabilities in the CV-22 (a SOF variant of the V-22 aircraft being developed by the Department of the Navy for the US Marine Corps).  No solicitation will be issued to negotiate the sole source CY 05 T&M labor rates.  The basic requirement was synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily on November 25, 1997, and updated on December 23, 1997.  The P3I Program was synopsized on February 1, 1999 and FY/CY03 was synopsized in the FedBizOps on March 28, 2003.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Ms. Valerie Romanchek, romancv@socom.mil or fax to  (813)828-7504.   See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This Amended Pre-Solicitation Notice is issued to clarify the constraints applicable to proposed SUBcontractors.  Accordingly, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) hereby advises prospective offerors that:  (1) The FHWA intends to make only LIMITED use of SUBcontractors, and it is anticipated that in any one proposal the AGGREGATE number of staffing hours, counted across ALL subs, will not exceed five percent of the proposal's grand total number of staffing hours; and (2) The FHWA WILL allow commercial (profit-oriented) organizations and commercial (profit-oriented) individuals to be proposed as SUBcontractors, but ONLY to the extent that each proposed commercial (profit-oriented) sub attests to, and demonstrates, in the PROPOSAL, its independence and impartiality.

SYNOPSIS
Engineering Support for the ITS Program

Scope

THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.   A non-profit organization is one which is not organized primarily for profit but which is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest, and which uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, and/or expand it operations.  The contract resulting from this procurement will provide the engineering support to the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  The ITS program is a research and development activity budgeted at approximately $100 million annually, and it encompasses the entire range of technologies currently known as ITS.

The incumbent contractor currently providing this support is the Mitretek Corporation, under Contract No. DTFH61-00-C-00001.  Mitretek is eligible to compete under the new procurement here synopsized.  

Special Requirements

The contractor will have access to a variety of sensitive material as a result of the support activities.  Typically the contactor will be involved in the following types of program activities:

1	Technical support in the development of Statements of Work and specifications for projects.
2	Evaluation of proposals submitted to execute the projects.
3	Development of program plans for areas of ITS research.
4	Monitoring of contractors’ performance in the execution of projects.
5	Technical evaluation of contractors’ work products resulting from these projects.
6	Technical analyses that are required to develop a project plan prior to the issuance of a solicitation for the project.
7	Provision of technical advice on the state of the art in certain technologies.

Because of the crucial need for impartiality as well as the APPEARANCE of impartiality in the performance of such work, each PRIME offeror (and the resulting PRIME contractor) must be a non-profit organization.  Profit-oriented INDIVIDUALS operating as INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS, may, however, be proposed by any offeror and may be used by the contractor.  The contractor must agree to NOT compete for ANY commercial ITS work, whether it be for a private or public entity seeking that work, during the Period of Performance of this contract and for one year thereafter.


Personnel Requirements

It is anticipated that this procurement will require approximately 80,000 AGGREGATE staffing hours of effort annually.  The personnel should be fundamentally systems engineers with a working knowledge of ITS systems.  The technical experience and background of the personnel will encompass at least the following disciplines:

	Traffic Engineering
	Modeling and system analysis
	Traffic Signal control Systems
	ITS Architecture
Public Transit Systems
Public Safety Systems
Collision Avoidance technologies
Evaluation of Project Effectiveness
Commercial Vehicle systems (CVISN)
ITS Standards and Standards Development Procedures
Communications Technologies
Traveler Information Systems
Transportation Safety Technologies

It is anticipated that AT LEAST one principal engineer with at least 10 years of experience will be required in each of the above disciplines.  It is estimated that the contract will include a total of about 15 or 16 different individuals occupying the position of principal engineer.  Since this work is aimed at assisting the ITS JPO in formulating the ITS program, the task requires that at least half of the technical staff (i.e., persons employed below the level of principal engineer) be senior people with more than five years of experience in at least one (and preferably in several) of the above disciplines.

The personnel categories required are as follows:

Principal Engineers -----------------------  30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
A principal engineer will have an advanced degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or physics and at least ten years of experience.  The principal engineer will be expected to be capable of leading a group of engineers in the development of program plans and recommending technical options to the JPO staff.


Senior Engineers  ----------------------30,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
          A senior engineer will have a degree in systems engineering, electrical engineering, or civil engineering.  However, a civil engineer must have prior experience in the implementation of ITS technologies.  Senior personnel are expected to be able to coordinate projects and provide seasoned judgment for the JPO staff.

Junior Staff  -------------------------------15,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.
	Junior staff members are expected to be degreed engineers who can perform analyses, research, and the evaluation of technical products. 

It is expected that administrative support will comprise about 6% of the total labor on these tasks, since administrative support of the JPO staff is not the objective of this procurement.  Accordingly:

Administrative Support-------------5,000 aggregate hours per calendar year.

All estimated numbers of aggregate hours as shown above are expressed as actual ON-THE-JOB hours.  The DUE DATE for the FHWA’s receipt of proposals, as shown above, is only an ESTIMATED due date.  The ACTUAL due date for receipt of proposals will be shown hereafter in the SOLICITATION (RFP) No. DTFH61-04-R-00029, that will be published in this same FedBizOpps web site.  Prospective offerors are strongly advised to MONITOR this FedBizzOpps web site on a regular basis in order to look for any AMENDMENTS to this Synopsis, that might be published hereafter.

<DESC>Questions and Answers 
               Solicitation FA7012-04-R-0017      


Question 1: The specifications states that the metal railings shall have a  galvanized finishes for railings that are to be installed exterior.  However the drawing at the details state to paint and/or match to the existing paint.

Clarification: The exterior railing should be galvanized finish and then prepared and painted. Color to match existing color of railing on west side.

Question 2: Sheet A-2 has a typical detail noted as 7 - A2/A6 to the right side of east elevation.  It appears as though this detail is actually noted on page A-6 as detail 6 - A2/A6.

Clarification:  Detail reference on drawing A-2 should be detail #6 on A-6
 
Question 3: The solicitation has the project being completed 170 days after notice to proceed.  However on page 6 of 36 it states 100 days.

Clarification: 170 Days is the correct period of performance.

Question 4: Based on my understanding of the drawings and specifications it appears as though the work on the exterior of the facility includes remove and replace all caulking/joint sealant horizontal and vertical throughout the entire facility less penthouse siding and penetrations and sill sealant at the spandrel glass above the canopy.

Clarification: Correct.

PHASE ONE REQUIREMENTS:  The purpose of this Phase One is to solicit Qualifications from Offerors for evaluation  to determine which Offerors demonstrate the highest qualifications to successfully deliver the project. Qualifications submitted, in response to this RFQ, will be evaluated using the four (4) Phase One Evaluation Factors listed below: 

Interested firms shall submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the capability of the firm.   All documentation shall be in an 8 1/2" x 11" format.   It shall include  (a) a cover letter referencing this Fed Biz Opps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments and may include photos and brochures.  The cover letter shall also identify a single point of contact, address, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses (if any) where inquiries or notices should be directed. An authorized representative of the Offeror's organization shall sign the letter. If the Offeror is a joint venture, all members shall sign the letter.  (b) Qualification submission requirements and evaluation criteria as described below:  For evaluation purposes, “similar” projects are defined as new construction or alteration/renovation of the same approximate size, scope and complexity completed or currently in progress where substantial progress has been made, within the past seven (7) years.  While the Government will consider past performance in delivery and management of any size or type space, primary consideration will be given to similar work.  Similar work is defined as construction of the same or greater quantity and complexity as proposed for this procurement; construction using the same basic building materials and systems (architectural, mechanical, electrical, fire and life safety, etc.); and construction designed for the same general use as this procurement.
  
Factor 1: Past Performance/Prior Experience  
Factor Description:  a.  This factor considers the quality of the Offeror’s prior experience and past performance in carrying out work of a similar nature with respect to construction.  Consideration will be given to success in areas of technical quality, delivery, timeliness, and budget maintenance.  The definition of “similar projects” for evaluation purposes is described above.  Each project evaluated need not have all the elements of similarity to be considered.  However, the Offeror must demonstrate, through a combination of projects, similar construction experience.  Prior experience of the offeror's principals (President, Vice President, etc.) may be used to qualify the offeror, but only where the principal has acquired the experience while serving as a principal of the offeror or another firm.
b.  Past performance information to be evaluated includes timeliness of delivery/performance, including adherence to contract schedules and timely submission or performance of required tests and submittals; resolution of disputes and delays, number of “show cause” letters and cure notices issued, number of contract extensions resulting from contractor-caused delays; conformance to contract requirements, including quality of workmanship, timeliness, and adequacy of correction of deficiencies, number and extent to warranty problems; on-the-job safety performance record including the number of lost or restricted workdays due to occupational injuries in comparison to the national average; compliance with key contract provisions (e.g., subcontracting program, labor standards, safety standards, reporting requirements, etc.); the Offeror’s history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.
c.  GSA Evaluators will contact a minimum of three (3) projects that have similar scope, requirements, and/or complexity to the projects addressed by this RFQ.  Evaluators may consider performance on contracts which are not submitted by the Offeror if they have knowledge of them.  The same basic questions shall be asked of each reference contacted.  The interviews shall be documented to indicate who called for GSA, who was interviewed, questions asked, and answers provided.  
Submittal Requirement:  The Offeror and all of the Offeror's key personnel must submit projects in which they have had a primary role in the performance of services within their respective disciplines in three (3) multi story commercial office buildings, involving similar work per building, within the past seven (7) years.  The Government has the right not to consider further any offer that fails to submit the required project information.  Each Offeror's key personnel must have performed on three (3) projects, and each shall submit the information on their project individually.  Each of the projects submitted must include a narrative of not more than five (5) typewritten, single spaced pages, one 8" wide x 10" high photograph, and project references with current contacts and telephone numbers for each project discussed.  The narrative must 1) include sufficient information to show that the project discussed had similar scope, requirements, and/or complexity to the project described in this RFQ and 2) address the questions posed in the "Past Performance" questionnaire.  The Government has the right to consider information it receives affecting the past performance of the offeror and/or offeror’s key personnel even though the information was not provided by the offeror and/or the offeror’s key personnel 
Standard for Evaluation:   The standard is met when the Offeror demonstrates a continuing history of successful project completion.  The Offeror has performed satisfactorily or better on all similar projects as evidenced by references contacted that also indicate they would contract with the offeror again for the same or similar work.

In order to be considered satisfactory, the offeror must have completed the work on-time with respect to intermediate completion targets, as well as total project completion goals, within budget and with no major technical problems or complaints which clearly resulted from deficiency in materials or work quality within the control of the construction contractor and in accordance with contract requirements. The offeror has not initiated an excessive number of unwarranted or frivolous requests for change orders.

Factor 2:  Principal Team Member Qualifications 
 Factor Description: a.   This factor considers construction experience, education, knowledge, and expertise of all the Principal Team Members (PTM).  For the purpose of this section, PTM is defined as:  The offeror’s principal in charge who must be an officer and/or owner of the Offering Entity, with at least seven (7) years experience in commercial office construction or renovation.  The principal-in-charge shall have the ability to make legal commitments on behalf of the Offeror and shall be responsible for all aspects of the project team.  Experience shall be demonstrated through submission of no less than three (3) projects.

b.  Consideration will be given to the following:  1) currently held position/title, 2) proposed project position/title, 3) education, 4) professional licensing and awards, and 5) relevant work experience over the past seven (7) years of PTM who will be assigned directly to the project.
Submittal requirement:  The offeror/general contractor, and sub-contractors shall each submit no more than two (2) page resume stating responsibility for the proposed project.  Resumes shall also describe 1) currently held position/title, 2) proposed project position/title, 3) education, 4) professional licensing and awards, and 5) relevant work experience over the past 7 years.  In addition, the resume shall include a brief summary of the roles of the team member for the referenced projects.  If role statements are not provided, it will be assumed that there is no significant project involvement.  The Offeror's key personnel defined as the principals of the Offeror, contractor or construction manager cannot change after receipt of Phase One offers without the written approval of the GSA Contracting Officer.  Notification and submittal of a change in the Offeror's key personnel must be timely to allow for proper evaluation by the Government.

REFERENCES.  The Government intends to contact those individuals and firms that are listed as references by the offeror to verify that the offeror’s characterization of its involvement is accurate, and to solicit their assessments of the quality of those services that were provided.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to verify that all references listed can be reached by telephone.  If a reference cannot be located based upon the information provided by the offeror, the Government is not required to consider the listed project.  If the Government cannot obtain past performance information from a sufficient number of general contractors, then the Government may find a proposal unacceptable. The Government is not required to contact all references provided, but will contact a sufficient number of references from each offeror to ascertain a reasonable determination of the Offeror’s Prior Experience and Past Performance. 

COMPLETENESS OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION.  Failure to list required project information under the past performance criteria stated above may be grounds for drawing a negative inference as to an offeror’s qualifications or responsibility, and may result in a determination that proposal is not acceptable.
Standard for Evaluation:  The standard is met when the offeror demonstrates that proposed personnel have the experience and minimum appropriate training and licensing to perform position proposed on this project. All licenses and certifications shall be current and valid.  All key responsibilities should be assigned, and clearly show who will manage the overall effort and who will have technical quality responsibility.

In addition to the narrative, photographs, catalog cuts, and manufacturers' published documentation may be used as reference exhibits.  The Offeror shall indicate on a timeline all major actions/phases to deliver the project within the proposed completion time, complete with major interactions/inspections/approvals by the Government and other organizations not under the Offeror's control.  The Offeror is responsible for establishing reasonable time allowances, including contingencies, for all project members' work and for involvement by outside organizations.  The selection of a proposal by the Government does not constitute approval of the schedule included in this Management Plan.
Standard of Evaluation:  The standard is met when the offeror has submitted a management plan indicating methods and means to ensure the project is managed in a manner, which will maximize the opportunity for successful completion of the project on time, on budget, and within quality expectation.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NFEC), Southwest Division, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Environmental Remediation Services at various locations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.  Resulting Contract’s will be fixed price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Environment Multiple Award Contract’s (EMAC).

This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business (See Note 1).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility of a small business.  NFEC Southwest intends to award more than two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity small business contracts.  

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contracts include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants may include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  It is anticipated that most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in California.  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business firm(s) whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be incorporated into the resulting contracts.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with the minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $60,000,000.  Fair opportunity will be provided for all resulting task orders in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).  

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, and Factor 3 - Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include proposed Task Order 0001).  Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 4 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is slightly less important than any one of the other factors.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with Sections L, and M of the solicitation.  

A pre-proposal site visit/meeting will be at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California for the proposed Task Order 0001 project.  The date and time for this site visit has not been established.

Due to space limitations, participation is limited to two (2) representatives from each firm.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.  

The solicitation will be available by electronic media only and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or http://www.eps.gov under pre-solicitation notice N68711-03-R-5112.

<CONTACT>DIANA ROMERO PURCHASING AGENT 3032369327     DLROMERO@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, Minnesota District, has a requirement for biological analyses including fish exposures and subsequent tissue and plasma processing. Services include the male fathead minnow exposure regime includes multiple and consecutive 22-28 day flow-through exposures to a variety of alkylphenols at multiple concentrations.  Fish tissue and plasma processing includes measurements of vitellogenin in fish plasma, processing of gonad and liver tissue for measurements of  gonadosomatic indices(GSI), hepatosomatic indices(HSI), histopathology analyses of gonad tissue for sexual stage, presence of oocytes, or other abnormalities, various biological assays and associated fish tissue processing. Consistency in exposure regime and processing techniques is needed in order to make comparisons between the currently proposed study and previous studies where the exposures and tissue processing were completed. This is critical due to potential differences in control water composition, gonad histopathology, and other tissue processing styles among laboratories.  The USGS has experienced high variability between gonad histopathology measurements between laboratories in the past that basically made different studies incomparable. The source of control water is a deep aquifer and can have a dramatic influence upon study results.  The basic chemistry (ions and nutrients) and has done extensive testing for over 100 organic compounds to show that ground water is free of potential chemicals that could interfere with the proposed exposures.  In addition a comparison of vitellogenin analytical techniques and results with the laboratory standard (Nancy Denslow's ICBR/Biotechnology Core laboratory at the University of Florida in Gainesville Florida) with similar results.  This is important to the current study as some of the previous vitellogenin analyses were completed by the University of Florida Laboratory and comparability between studies is critical.  Timeliness which is critical, rapid time necessary to complete the work based on short timelines established by the OFA funding agreement.  Timeliness also allows for 'real time' information so that sampling strategy can be adjusted if needed.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the item specified as a sole source from St. Cloud State University, St. Cloud, Minnesota and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.     However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the government's only official notice of this procurement. The proposed contract consists of a twelve month basic year with one twelve month option periods. See Notes 12 and 22.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses certified as 8(a), as well as those owned by Historically Underutilized Business Zone concerns (HUBZone) and service-disabled veterans to provide cost realism reviews of proposals received by the NIH.  Proposals will be responding to two planned contracts being conducted under “competitive sourcing” standard competitions, in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, as revised.

Specifically, the contractor will 1) assess each proposed offeror’s/subofferor’s responsibility; 2) evaluate the costs in each business proposal to determine if they are realistic and consistent with the proposed organizational structure, staffing levels and other technical requirements identified by each offeror/subofferor in their technical proposal; 3) prepare a report to summarize and explain the results of each review; and 4) provide such cost realism support services on site at the NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Rockville,  Maryland.

The Government will evaluate capability information, responding to this market survey, using the following criteria: 1) demonstrated ability from past experience to perform cost realism reviews of business/cost proposals; 2) demonstrated ability from past experience to perform specialized cost realism reviews of business/cost proposals submitted in response to OMB Circular A-76 competitions; 3) past experience in preparing work  papers to document cost realism reviews; 4) past experience in preparing reports to summarize findings and conclusions of cost realism reviews and  5) past experience in providing training relative to performing cost realism reviews; and 6) demonstrated ability to access specialized subject matter expertise as it relates to the technical scope of the “competitive sourcing” study.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, with a size standard of an average in annual receipts of $6.0M over the last 3 years. The Performance Work Statements (PWSs) for the two “competitive sourcing” efforts currently being studied and competed under the requirements of OMB Circular A-76 are posted in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and at http://a-76.nih.gov/.

The NIH will synopsize this procurement under one of the Government’s small business set-aside programs.

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number, noting the size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., small business and those owned by the disadvantaged, certified 8(a), women, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concerns, veterans, and service-disabled veterans; and 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability and capacity to technically perform. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information as it relates to cost realism reviews is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the “limitations on subcontracting” imposed on small business set-aside programs. 

Responding firms should provide three (3) copies of a tailored capability statement to Foteni Tiffany, National Institutes of Health, Room 529W, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892-7663 within ten (10) business days from the date of publication of this notice. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.M, Greenbelt, MD 20771 Description  This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Request for Information for Planning Purposes." It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office of Space  Science (OSS) and the Living With a Star (LWS) program have the stated mission to design, develop, integrate, launch, and operate the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The SDO is the first mission of the space weather research network for the LWS program.  The primary objective of the mission is to study the Sun to understand solar variations that influence life on Earth.  SDO is scheduled to launch in 2008 into a Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) with a mission life of five years. NASA GSFC is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Project Attitude Control System (ACS) Star Trackers. The present requirements are specified in the attached documents:  Exhibit 1 – ACS Star Trackers SOW 464-ACS-LEGL-0026;  Exhibit 2 – ACS Star Trackers Specification 464-ACS-SPEC-0031  Exhibit 3 - Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS) This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a draft Statement of Work, draft Specification, and draft Deliverable Items List and Schedule via the internet, and solicit input and recommendations from interested parties. The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA/GSFC's knowledge of industry's capabilities. NASA/GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project. This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202. The intent of the sessions is to provide a dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA/GSFC's requirements and its acquisition approach. The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Performance Specification (Exhibit 2), and the Deliverable Items List & Schedule (Exhibit 3). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification, SOW, and the Deliverable Items List. Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comments that either describe how a potential offeror's actuator could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror's position on such a requirement. This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions. It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable;  2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule; and. 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing Star Trackers.   Additionally, it is requested that potential offerors provide the following information:  1) an error tree for the accuracy numbers provided (They must be 3 sigma and End-of-Life); 2) If the  potential offeror’s star tracker design is such that it has a separate electronics box, provide the maximum allowable harness length to be used to communicate between the sensor and the electronics box; 3) Provide the Mechanical/Hardware ICD;  4) Provide the current method of heat dissipation for the star tracker, and if it is possible for the star tracker to dissipate heat by radiating out of one or two of the sides adjacent to the aft end of the star tracker; 5) Provide the requirements you meet, and the requirements you take exception to; 6) Provide comments on the specification; 7) Provide a rough price estimate; 8) Advise if the requirement is considered commercial, and provide data on customary practices concerning customization. In addition, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether the firm is large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned. RSDO vendors are requested to respond to this RFI in accordance with the terms and conditions established in their contracts to the extent practicable. NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO ACS Star Tracker requirement that will be furnished at this time. Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Jennifer J. Awkard, NASA/GSFC, Mail Code 210.3, Bldg 11, Rm S215G, Greenbelt, MD 20771, e-mail: Jennifer.J.Awkard@nasa.gov no later than the response date indicated above.

<DESC>A literature review indicates current surveillance and reconnaissance systems (S&R) in the Middle East and Southwest Asia are structured to observe huge areas and attempt to detect movement of hostile forces.  The “forensic” approach of examining evidence to find criminals seems to be ignored despite potential returns from apprehending terrorists after the fact.  The United States Air Force (USAF) Command and Control Battlelab (C2B) proposes investigation of the possibility of using past S&R imagery to locate an explosion, run the data back in time to identify the vehicle (or object) which carried the munitions, “lock” onto that vehicle and backtrack to locate significant portions of its path – assembly areas, passenger pick-up, arming site, and any other spot with potential intelligence value.  C2B is currently investigating commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies that can lead to a possible application to the concept outlined above and, concurrently, surveying the capabilities and attributes of existing S&R systems (satellites, U-2, J-STARS, Global Hawk, Predator and others, including Army and Navy S&R assets).  The technology will be, primarily, breakthroughs in imagery, net-centric gathering and sharing of data, collaboration of disparate agencies, target identification, moving target indication, merging imagery in various formats, and any other technology with application to pinpointing the location of an explosive event, “locking” on and tracking a target, and distributing information. Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning emerging and mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Combat Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 13 Aug 2004.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Edward Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctcnsc.org or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Lillion.  You may contact Mr. Lillion with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6516.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development NASA Research Announcement (NNH40ZSS001N-PID)  Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (NNH04ZSS001N-PID) NASA Research Announcement (NRA)  Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, “Planetary Instrument Definition and Development” (see   http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_s/nra/current/nnh04zss001n/appendB_11.html   ). The Planetary Instrument Definition and Development (PIDD) program supports the advancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that shows promise for use in scientific investigations on future planetary missions. The goal of the program is not to develop flight-qualified hardware but rather to define and develop scientific instruments or components of such instruments to the point where the instruments may be proposed in response to future announcements of flight opportunity without additional extensive technology development.  This NRA solicits proposals for instrument definition and breadboard development for the following future types of missions:  Discovery Program (For additional information see   http://centauri.larc.nasa.gov/newfrontiers/   )  The emphasis in this NRA is also on the development of miniaturized, low power, low cost instruments for Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other similar missions. Instrument definition and development studies can take place at several stages, including feasibility studies, conceptual design, and laboratory breadboarding (but not brassboarding) of critical components and complete instruments. Proposed instruments must address significant scientific questions relevant to stated NASA goals.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the PIDD Program to develop proposals and execute development and performance demonstrations of components and subsystems. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in component and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide components and subsystems consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control This criteria evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  Your responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469 Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Nancy M. Sessoms, Contracting Officer 757-864-2471 Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is 4:00 p.m. local time July 2, 2004.  The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.

As such we are seeking partners to 1) help refine instrument measurement requirements particularly as they relate to the role of aerosol in the Martian climate; and 2) help design a small, inexpensive in situ aerosol measurement system capable of extended and unattended operation in a Mars-like environment. (2) Wavelength-Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer Technical Point of Contact:	Warren C. Kelliher  (E-mail: Warren.C.Kelliher@nasa.gov)  Phone:	(757) 864-4172 NASA Langley Research Center is actively developing X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometers (XRFS) for use on future Planetary and Space Exploratory missions to provide elemental analysis of various regolith surfaces. Based on previous experience with the XRFS used on the Viking Mission to Mars, Langley is developing state-of-the-art XRFS components to be used in different instrument configurations for in-situ analysis, remote surface analysis and subsurface analysis. We are also interested in further development of micro and total reflection XRFS technologies for space applications. For this specific proposal, LaRC is seeking partners with expertise in both Wavelength Dispersive and Energy Dispersive X-ray  Fluorescence to combine both technologies into a miniature instrument to be used as a planetary elemental analyzer. We are particularly interested in the Wavelength Dispersion in order to provide high resolution analysis of the low atomic number biogenic elements (C,O, & N).  (3) A  Micro Mass Spectrometer for Space Applications Technical Point of Contact:  Seun K. Kahng  (E-mail: Seun.K.Kahng@nasa.gov) Phone:	(757) 864-7553 NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners with which to develop a MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) magnetic-sector mass spectrometer with a novel ionization source and an ion optic lens as its enabling components.  The completion of the project will result in a working magnetic-sector mass spectrometer capable of detecting a host of chemical species inline with several stated NASA goals and complimentary to outer planet roadmap missions.   Partners are sought with expertise in MEMS and miniaturized mass spectrometers technology. The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to develop micro mass spectrometer with the following characteristics: the proposed micro mass spectrometer includes an ion source, ion lens, mass filter, and ion detector array fabricated as a monolithic unit with a dimensional footprint of 20 mm x 20 mm x 10 mm, a mass of less than 50 grams and operates with a power consumption of less than 10 mW.  Additionally, the device will have a mass resolution of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), a mass range of 1 ~ 300 amu, and a sub part-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity to a host of chemical species.  NASA Langley is strongly interested in partners that have access to and experience in conducting focused research and development work toward a laboratory demonstration of breadboard micro mass spectrometer with the above specified characteristics. Partners with capability for small-scale production and experience in technology transition to external manufacturers are also preferred. (4)  Radiation Detection in Space Technical Point of Contact: Brad Crawford (E-mail: Bradley.L.Crawford@nasa.gov) Phone:	(757) 864-4549 NASA Langley Research Center is interested in developing small, light weight, low cost and low power consuming devices for detecting radiation.

<DESC>Market Research/Sources Sought for a quantity of 2,752 each BSU-85/B Retarder Fin Assemblies, NSN: 1325-01-218-8419.  This fin assembly includes a ballute (combination balloon and parachute) air bag which deploys from the tail provides a high speed, low altitude delivery capability by quickly slowing the bomb and allowing the aircraft to escape the blast pattern. The tail assembly consists of a low-drag canister unit containing the ballute, and a release lanyard assembly that opens the canister releas ing the ballute.  The ballute assembly is made from high strength low porosity nylon fabric. When the bomb is released from the aircraft a lanyard unlatches the back cover which opens, releasing part of the nylon chute/retarder. Air turbulence at the rear of the bomb acts on that portion of the retarder, pulling the remainder out of the housing. Ram air inflation is accomplished through four air inlet ports toward the aft end of the ballute. The weapon can be delivered in the low-drag mode (canister remains  closed after release) or in the high drag mode. The pilot may select either a high drag or low drag configuration depending on mission requirements.  Manufacture of the fins requires specialized skills and processes.  The specialized skills and processes include welding, heat-treating, machining, and metal forming to assure the accuracy required for fin locations.  The producer shall possess the necessary skills/facilites for sewing the large nylon chute.  The facilities must also have high quality phospha te coating, spray wash painting, and zinc phosphate capabilities.  A full and open solicitation is anticipated upon the results of this market research responses/interest received.

To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement that demonstrates in writing their ability to meet the following requirements:  The new fluorometer must contain gated capabilities to efficiently measuring Perkin Elmer DELFIA fluoroimmunoassay kits used in the laboratory.  (It is imperative that the Perkin Elmer DELFIA FIA kits continue to be used for studies conducted in the laboratory to maintain consistency of results).  Specifically, the fluorometer must be able to measure time-resolved fluorescence for the europium chelates used in Perkin Elmer DELFIA time-resolved FIAs.  Measurements must be delayed about 200-400 microseconds after photo-excitation to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.  The fluorometer must be able to excite chelates with a pulse of light produced at a wavelength of about 335-340 nanometers, and read the fluorescent signal at a wavelength of about 615 nanometers.  The excitation and emission cycles must repeat at least 1000 cycles per second.  The fluorometer must be designed and constructed to provide optimal performance characteristics (precision & accuracy) when using DELFIA FIA kits, and to allow easy selection of assay protocols on the fluorometer’s operating software.  The instrument must be pre-programmed to accept and handle Perkin Elmer DELFIA FIA protocols.  It must also be designed to allow for easy custom programming for additional assays.  Pre-programmed and custom programmed data must be yielded using Windows-based software that has bi-directional communication with the fluorometer.  The fluorometer software should allow the following data to be generated and accumulated:  
1.   Automatically track and plot at least six levels of controls in a variety of outputs to include Levy Jennings Plot, CUSUM with V-Mask plate and display histograms of the data.  2.

<SUBJECT>41 -- WAIVER OF NONMANUFACTURER RULE - ICE MAKING MACHINERY MANUFACTURING
<DESC>The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Ice Making Machinery Manufacturing. The basis for  waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and sources must be submitted on or before July 12, 2004.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 205-7280; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act, (Act)15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR 121.1204, in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal Procurement Data System.  The SBA received a request on June 14, 2004 to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Ice Making Machinery Manufacturing.  In response, SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Ice Making Machinery Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 333415.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for this NAICS code. 
AUTHORITY:  15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17).

USAID/Ethiopia
SOLICITATION NUMBER:  	663-04-006
ISSUANCE DATE:  		June 21, 2004
CLOSING DATE/TIME:  		July 9, 2004
POSITION TITLE:  		Senior Policy Advisor
MARKET VALUE:		$74,335-$96,637 (GS-14)
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  	Two Years (with possible extension)
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 	 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
AREA OF CONSIDERATION: 	U.S. Citizens or Third Country Nationals
 
POSITION DESCRIPTION

If you require detailed background information, we can e-mail you through your e-mail address.
 
New Points of Departure:  Since 2000, the GOE has instituted several significant policy and strategy changes.  The government agrees that it must address the root causes of the growing food insecurity.  For the first time in 2003, the GOE agreed with all major donors on a detailed policy agenda, under the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) and the World Bank-led Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) policy matrix, needed for poverty reduction and food security.  This process, now formalized under the PRSC, is encouraging, and will continue and deepen.  

The government has welcomed investors, both foreign and local, through streamlined processes for permits and licenses, and through easier access to (still state-owned) land.  The federal government established a regular public-private dialogue process with key private sector actors, while regional governments have set up industrial zones to attract investment in their regions.  The GOE is proceeding with its World Trade Organization application, and is scrutinizing needed changes within its own systems to open up the economy and trade to be eligible for WTO accession.  More immediately, the government is taking action to join the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) free trade area.

The GOE has recognized that famine vulnerability, hunger and poverty are a matter of national security, and that the country’s political stability rests on the ability of the government, in cooperation with international donors, NGOs and local groups, to address these issues.   Also, the GOE has begun to allow non-state actors, specifically the private sector and civil society, to expand and play a much greater role in the Ethiopian society and economy.  There is a nascent, but growing, Ethiopian private sector, especially related to agriculture and a growing Ethiopian civil society capable of articulating and managing new issues

USAID Strategic Components:  The new USAID strategy (soon to be available on the Internet) has the following goals, objectives and intermediate results, relevant to this position:

USAID/Ethiopia’s Long-term Goal: A More Peaceful, Prosperous and Healthy Ethiopia  

USAID/Ethiopia’s Five-year Strategy Goal: Foundation Established for Reducing Famine Vulnerability, Hunger, and Poverty

Strategic Objectives (SOs) and Intermediate Results (IRs) particularly relevant to the SPA role:

SO 13:  Capacity to Anticipate and Manage through Shocks Increased:
IR 13.3 Selected crisis management policies reformed and implemented 

SO 14:  Human Capacity and Social Resiliency Increased:
	[Various IRs and Sub-IRs related to policies for health, nutrition, population, HIV/AIDs, and education]

SO 15:  Capacity for Good Governance Increased:
IR 15.1. Accountability by Regional and Local Governments Improved;
IR 15.2. Civil Society Capacity to Engage Government Strengthened;

SO 16:  Market-led Economic Growth and Resiliency Increased:
IR 16.1 Selected Essential Policy Reforms Implemented

PSO17: Knowledge Management Coordinated and Institutionalized:
IR 17.1: Collaboration and coordination for support to strategic decisions enhanced 
IR 17.2: Ethiopian and international institutions contributing to decisions to reduce vulnerability, increase resiliency, and promote growth
IR 17.3:  Information needed to manage shocks timely and appropriately disseminated
IR 17.4:  Rapid analysis and evaluation supports Mission program implementation 
The PSO 17, Knowledge Management Program Support Objective, plays a cross-cutting coordinating role for the overall strategy.  It is under the Program Office for that reason, but will be mainly funded through activities under the other SOs.
