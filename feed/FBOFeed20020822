DRAFT
Scope of Work
For Management of Computer Delivery
Purpose
The purpose of this agreement is to provide a vehicle for receiving, storing, testing, distributing, installing, training, maintaining, and monitoring use of donated computers from the U.S. to schools in Uzbekistan in the most sustainable manner feasible, and procuring additional equipment as detailed below to fill the balance. 
Background
This program was conceived in a discussion between DPM Azimov and Aministrator Natsios in November 2001, when Azimov requested that USAID assist in equipping schools with computers.  This request was repeated during high-level meetings at the Joint Security and Cooperation Consultations in January 2002. This request was agreed to by the U.S. delegation led by Ambassador Taylor.
Of nearly 10,000 schools in Uzbekistan, about half are equipped with computers. Only 1.2 percent of these schools have Pentium class computers, and about 7 percent have 386-486 computers. The rest have Soviet computers of some 20 years ago. Three percent of all students in Uzbekistan have access to computers in their schools. Due to the age of those computers and accompanying lack of spare parts, many of these computers are not in working order. The U.S. Government has agreed to donate and ship a number of used 110/240V computers and monitors with some extras, such as cables, from the United States to Uzbekistan.
This program supports a new priority of USAID on education and youth in Central Asia, and links with a larger-scale basic education initiative now in the design phase.
Period
Arrival of the computers in Tashkent is expected in late 2002. This agreement will begin one month prior to the expected arrival of the computers and continue for 8 more months (2 months distribution + 6 months maintenance & monitoring).
Program description
The primary purpose of this program is to transfer donated used computers from the US to primary and secondary schools in Uzbekistan in pursuit of familiarizing students with computer technology and use, and connecting them to the internet where feasible.
Pre-Arrival Activities
Several procedures will need be developed, approved by USAID, and acted upon before arrival of the equipment, including: an inventory format for the equipment that will record specific details regarding distribution and working condition of each individual piece of equipment over the life of this award; a distribution plan for beneficiary schools; a Beneficiary Agreement that includes policies and procedures to which those schools must adhere; a training plan for appropriate personnel at distribution sites upon installation; and a monitoring plan for the post-distribution phase. In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will also be expected to identify sources and price quotes for additional computers, monitors, and accessories, as well as introductory computer courses and materials, along with accessories, operating system, and software.
Proposals should include a mobilization plan for the first 60 days of the activity that covers all of the activities in this ?Pre-Arrival? section. This plan should take the form of a calendar with detailed information as to when and how these various logistical issues will be managed.
Inventory format:
The contractor will develop a format for inventory of the equipment that includes fields for serial numbers, working condition, date and location of distribution, memory capacity, operating system, software installed, and dates and descriptions of repairs. This inventory should be a living document from which repair, software installation, and distribution records can be kept through life of this activity. USAID will approve the format prior to arrival of the equipment.
Distribution Plan:
The contractor will assess which schools in which communities should be potential beneficiaries of these computers, what software will be necessary, and in what quantity. This assessment will be based upon electrical reliability in the community, security considerations, and the community?s ability and willingness to adhere to the Beneficiary Agreement (outlined below). The equipment should be concentrated in the areas where USAID is already active.
Based on its assessment, the contractor will provide USAID with various potential packages for distribution of the equipment, based on packing lists that will be provided upon shipment. The packages will include which schools get which equipment, keeping in mind that each school should receive at least one of the larger-memory CPUs. The packages should also include which schools will have reliable internet access, although non-availability of internet should not preclude a school?s receiving some equipment. USAID will actively participate in the formulation of this plan, and must approve the final version (with GOU input as necessary) before distribution can begin.
Procurement:
In the event that the U.S. Government is not able to fill the order of computers from its surplus stock, the contractor will be required to procure 110/220V Pentium II personal computers (no Macs) and 110/220Vcolor monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, cables, and power cords. The computers will have at least 16 MB RAM, .5 GB, and video cards. For the purposes of this proposal, bidders are to budget for 200 PCs, monitors, UPS?s, keyboards, mice, power cords, and other necessary cords and cables. Procured items need not be new, but must be in good working order, and must fit the specification noted in this paragraph.
In addition, the contractor will identify sources and obtain quotes for necessary accessories, including 500 European plugs, and 1,000 sets of Cyrillic stickers for keyboards. The packing list will provide a more detailed picture of what this procurement may entail, but the contractor should budget according to these items for the purposes of this document. Once the packing list is received, the contractor will provide a report to USAID that outlines how many computers, monitors, UPS?s and other supplementary materials (cords, cables, etc.) will be needed before delivery and installation can begin.
In this pre-arrival period, the contractor will explore possibilities for special discounts that might be offered by local internet provider for schools, especially schools in poorer, rural areas of the country. The contractor should also explore the possibility of the GOU?s subsidizing this cost to schools, especially once the period of this award is completed.
The contractor will also identify and obtain price quotes for course materials that schools and teachers will use for various levels of computer courses. Depending upon what is already installed on the computers that we receive (assuming that some are educational), USAID will work with the contractor to decide which courses to procure.
All procurement will be undertaken in accordance with the USAID Eligibility Rules for Goods and Services (attached), and budgets should reflect costs accordingly.
Beneficiary Agreement:
The contractor will develop a Beneficiary Agreement that all beneficiary schools must sign in order to receive any equipment. This Beneficiary Agreement will be approved by USAID before distribution begins. In addition to the hard and fast rule that these computers are not for resale, this agreement will include the school?s commitment to:
allow appropriate teachers to attend training on the computers;  
install only licensed software on the computers;
allow students access to the internet (where internet is available) during most school days;
adhere to policies and procedures developed by the contractor and approved by USAID;
maintain equipment after this award?s maintenance period expires;
develop a system of user fees for non-student users that will cover costs of internet access during school hours. 
Training Plan:
The contractor will develop a 2-3 day course for appropriate school personnel at the distribution site to teach basic use and maintenance practices, including efficient use of the internet where appropriate. The training should also include a reiteration of the policies and procedures to which beneficiaries will adhere, how to start and sustain user fee systems, and should introduce identified course materials.
Monitoring Plan:
The contractor will develop a separate monitoring plan for the equipment to be carried out after distribution and installation. This plan will lay out travel to each of the beneficiary schools once a month to see first hand how the computers are being used, advise the school on other perhaps more advanced uses in their particular situations, and record and resolve any problems that may have occurred with the equipment. A form for each monitoring visit will be developed upon which to record these issues, along with any online partnerships with US or other schools and any webpages created at the school. This plan and accompanying form will be approved by USAID before distribution is complete. Mention of this plan should be made in the Beneficiary Agreement. 
All pre-arrival activities should be completed by the estimated time of arrival of the equipment.
Arrival and Pre-Distribution Activities
Shipment of the donated computers to Tashkent will be arranged by USAID/CAR. Upon its arrival in Tashkent, USAID will provide letters for customs clearance. Once cleared, the contractor will take receivership of all equipment and deliver it to a storage facility with appropriate security, space, and environmental conditions for computers.
The contractor will arrange for a publicity event, perhaps at the storage facility. The event should include appropriate USAID and GOU education officials, perhaps some personnel from likely beneficiary schools, and the press. USAID and the US Embassy can be of some assistance with regard to this event, but the contractor must be prepared to take on most of the responsibility for it.
Careful, detailed inventory of the equipment, including memory capacity and software applications already installed in CPUs, and working condition of all equipment, will be recorded and supplied to the Uzbekistan Country Office and to USAID/CAR?s Contracts Office. The contractor will assure that when plugged in, all hardware is switched to 240V, and will label and test all equipment, and record in the inventory its working condition. Any damage will be noted in the inventory. Any damaged equipment will be repaired by the contractor if possible. Irreparable equipment must be noted to USAID. All necessary plug re-fitting will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
Each USG-donated CPU will arrive with an operating system installed. Other software already on the CPU is likely to vary greatly. We will not know until this testing phase which CPUs require which software, based on the distribution plan packages and the assessment of needs. Anti-virus software should be one prerequisite to any CPU before distribution. The contractor will recommend to USAID which software packages (and how many) to procure, and obtain quotes. Upon USAID approval, the contractor will procure that software and install it on the appropriate CPU, updating the inventory as software is installed. All newly procured CPUs will require operating systems, and other software packages recommended by the contractor.
The contractor will submit a list of software to be procured, and its cost, for USAID approval. This list will be based upon
the assessment of needs outlined in the previous paragraph (including the USG-donated CPUs and newly procured CPUs),
software already available (installed or uninstalled) through this donation, and 
the price quote obtained earlier.
Once procured, the contractor will load the software as per the distribution plan.
Once all software is installed and recorded on the inventory, the inventory is to be considered in its initial phase, and shall be submitted to USAID.
Based on the initial inventory, USAID and the contractor will together decide upon the final distribution plan for the equipment. At least one faster computer should be assigned to each school as possible.
Distribution, Monitoring, and Maintenance
The contractor will be responsible for distributing and installing all equipment, and seeing to appropriate electrical and security upgrades as necessary, according to the USAID-approved distribution plan. Each school must sign a Beneficiary Agreement before installation will begin. Internet connections will be established as part of the installation where appropriate, along with any appropriate networking. The contractor will also provide at least one day?s training to appropriate school personnel as to the proper usage and basic maintenance of the equipment, according to the approved training plan.
Internet access to appropriate beneficiary schools will be provided as part of this award for a period of 6 months from installation date.
Distribution, installation, and training should be complete within two months of the equipment?s arrival.
After distribution is made, the contractor is responsible for maintenance of all computer equipment for a period of six months, on an on-call basis. USAID expects the contractor to respond to repair calls within 24 hours of receiving word of malfunction. Where possible, appropriate school personnel should be on hand to observe the repair, so that they may learn to carry it out in the future, should the problem arise again. This fact will be made clear in the Beneficiary Agreements. Any equipment destroyed in this period at the beneficiary location will be reported in monitoring visit reports to USAID.
Over this final six-month period, the contractor will carry out the agreed to monitoring plan, and report to USAID monthly. USAID will conduct a review near the end of this 6-month period to assess the need to exercise the extension option.
Selection Criteria and Requirements
The implementing partner shall have a proven ability to handle high-profile projects, long-term presence, relevant experience, and commitment to the region, good track record, demonstrated organizational and administrative capacity, and necessary technical skills and expertise to achieve the goals of the program.

Offerors should note that these criteria: (1) serve as the standard against which all proposals will be evaluated, and (2) serve to identify the significant matters which offerors should address in their proposals.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: BEST VALUE
A review panel established under the direction of the Contracting Officer, USAID/CAR, will evaluate proposals.  The review panel and the Contracting Officer will use ?Best Value? criteria to determine the proposal most advantageous to the U.S. Government. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equal to cost or price. Technical evaluation factors, and the subfactors thereof, are listed below in their relative order of importance. Contract award shall be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose combined technical and cost factor offer the best value to the U.S. Government.
A. COST EVALUATION
The contractor should have a structure that will allow it to provide the greatest value (highest results) at the lowest cost; minimizing and/or eliminating overall administrative costs, overhead, subcontract pass-through costs, profit, international staff benefits, home office communications and support, and other non-value added costs. Each offeror's cost proposal (base period and option periods) shall be evaluated based on the following criteria in comparison with the cost proposal of other offerors:
1) Effectiveness of proposed cost control structure
Budget transparency to effectively track expenditures;
Consistency of proposed LOE, travel costs and ODCs;
Soundness of purchase and acquisition methods;
Subcontracting methods are clearly defined.
2) Cost efficiency of proposed Other Direct Costs
Offers market competitive pricing estimates of tangible items to be used for contract performance;
Competitiveness pricing and purchase methods of in-country air travel and surface transportation.
3) Reasonableness of overall proposed price
Price has not been assigned a numerical weight. Offerors are reminded that the U.S. Government is not obligated to award a negotiated contract on the basis of the lowest proposed cost (see FAR 15.101-1) or to the offeror with the highest technical evaluation score. For this procurement technical proposal is equal to cost or price relative to deciding who best might perform the work, price and other factors considered. Therefore, after the final evaluation of the proposals, the Contracting Officer will make the award to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, considering both technical and cost factors.  It should be noted that estimate cost is an important factor and its importance as an evaluation factor will increase as the degree of equality of technical competence between proposals increases.
TECHNICAL EVALUATION
1) Managerial Capacity
Demonstrates:
- capacity to establish and adhere to complicated, detailed task plans (transportation, distribution, inventories, etc.);
- capacity to manage the logistical requirements for operations in diverse locations;
- capacity to track progress of all facets of the program, provide reports which accurately present program status, and deal effectively with opportunities and problems as they arise;
- an effective system for managing subcontracts, joint-venture relationships or any other method proposed for involving the work of other firms or organizations to carry out the contract;
- capacity to manage budgets and reporting requirements in a timely manner.
Mobilization Plan.
Along with the Technical Proposal the Offeror must submit a Mobilization Plan. This plan will take the form of a calendar that will guide resources and initial activities. The mobilization plan will provide details of work to be carried out in the initial 60-day period of the contract. At a minimum, it will cover the anticipated logistics of contract start-up, the process and timing of establishing administrative and financial control systems, and pre-distribution activities outlined in the Scope of Work. It will also cover the timing of the initial deployment of all staff, and the plan for the initial activities to be executed by these staff members.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-87127; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).   The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract for creating a highly competitive information technology (IT) organization for the next 20 years, including an IT organizational structure assessment and recommendations and an IT corporate strategic plan.  Statement of Objectives.  The mission of the Minerals Management Service is managing the mineral resources on the outer continental shelf in an environmentally sound and safe manner and to timely collect, verify, and distribute mineral revenues from Federal and Indian lands. Organizational statements of purpose: Administration and Budget (A&B) provides management, policy, and direction of the information technology, personnel, procurement, administrative support, budgetary, and financial management processes to support the bureau's program offices and other federal activities.   Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) provides management, policy and direction for all minerals revenue management processes to ensure the efficient, timely and accurate collection and disbursement of mineral leasing revenue due to American Indian Trust Tribes and individual Indian lessors (allottees), States, and the U.S. Treasury.  Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) provides management, policy and direction for all offshore oil, gas and mineral lease, production, and inspection activities.  It manages the natural resources on the outer continental shelf to ensure an effective economic return and a safe environment that balances the interests of the nation's economic welfare and a partnership with industry. Policy and Management Improvement (PMI) provides policy review and coordinated program and policy positions for the Director.  It conducts special studies, manages the strategic planning process, oversees the regulatory and information collection programs and provides policy analysis to ensure optimum program performance and success for MMS. It also manages the MMS appeals function. Statement of Objective:  The federal government has developed a body of knowledge on methods to manage and acquire information technology.  Laws, regulations and OMB guidance are plentiful.  While existing guidance for managing information technology within the federal government should be considered, the thrust of this requirement is not a summary of existing laws, regulations and guidelines on information management nor information technology best practices.  Rather than reciting the obvious, the objectives of this project are the development of a strategy, and organizational structure and process essential for creating a highly competitive information technology (IT) organization for the next 20 years.  The current IT workforce is spread throughout the various program offices and support organizations within the bureau and is aligned in stovepipe organizations. The Chief Information Officer is the Associate Director for Administration and Budget.  The senior IT Manager is the Chief, Information Resource Management, within Administration and Budget.  The AB/IRM office, which is located in Herndon, VA, has policy and operational responsibility and must coordinate intra-bureau cross functional activities with the program office's IT managers.  IRM coordinates all IT-related issues for the bureau with the Department of the Interior.  OMM and MRM have operational and policy staff located in Herndon, VA, and New Orleans, LA, and Denver, CO, respectively.  Each program office has a functional IT manager that reports to the Associate Director.  The IT managers represent the program office's IT interests and manage the IT work within the program office.  OMM and MRM IT staffs provide limited cross functional IT operational support for the bureau as well as IT support for their respective program offices.  Total government IT staff bureau-wide is 132 FTE.  MMS uses a variety of contractors to assist with programming, operational support, enterprise support, and help desk support.  Contractor support is divided among the program offices in stove-piped relationships and sometimes limited cross-functional relationships.  Total contractor employed IT staff working for MMS is 213 FTE.  Total annual expenditure for FY 2001 for IT is $56 million or 23% of the bureau's FY2001 budget of $240 million.  An electronic copy of a report entitled An Overview of Information Technology across the MMS is available for interested offerors by contacting the contracting officer.  All bureau IT activities are coordinated through an IT Managers committee called the Council of Information Management Officials (CIMO.)  IT projects are reviewed within the program office through a variety of decision-making processes before being reviewed by the bureau's senior managers and finally by the Department of the Interior.  The CIMO has a mixed record of success in building support for intra-bureau opportunities to share resources.  In addition there are eight other committees that are responsible for IT projects within the bureau.  MMS has had a very good record of managing IT projects through the OMB approval process and implementing projects funded by Congress.  MRM has had a major re-engineering project underway for the past 3-years that is transforming its business processes.  OMM is beginning a major re-engineering project to transform its business processes.  The OMM project has been approved by OMB for funding in fiscal year 2003.  Expected Outcomes: a. Within existing structures, recommended organizational responsibilities that can effectively address the management of IT within MMS.  b. The recommendations will consider the impacts of the Department of the Interior IT strategic goals and other resource documents in developing the MMS plan.  c. A corporate IT strategy that provides specific goals and objectives for MMS over the next 5-years.  d. Each strategy must show how improvement will be made in 1. Decision-making, 2. Service delivery, 3.  Knowledge management and 4. Effective and efficient resource allocation.  Deliverables: 1. Corporate IT strategy and an IT organizational strategy with an implementation plan.  2.

Complete personnel and organizational documentation for proposed changes.  5. Post implementation organizational survey and results. 6. Communication strategy for explaining the strategies and recommendations to employees.  7. Monthly progress reports.  8. Senior Executive briefings at the beginning of the project and upon completion.  9. Draft and final reports in print and electronic format.  Acquisition Strategy:  The total estimated value of this effort is $500,000.00  Contract Type:  Firm-Fixed Price  Period of Performance:  12 months or less to develop and successfully implement the strategy and recommendations.  Payment:  50% of the contract cost based for incremental implementation milestone met.  The remaining 50% of the cost will be paid on successful conclusion of the project.  The acceptance and payment of the incremental implementation costs will not preclude the government from rejecting the project on conclusion if it determines the project has not met expectations.  Acceptance Criteria:  1. A thorough IT organizational strategy that considers all organizational issues is developed to create a highly competitive Information Technology organization.  The strategy is successfully implemented.  Employees are trained and organizationally aligned.  Employees and management understand the benefits of the alignment and all personnel procedures are completed and approved.  All costs are reported.  2.

INTRODUCTION
       
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of the Treasury with a unique combination of responsibilities dedicated to reducing violent crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. A key component of ATF?s arsenal of crime fighting weapons is its Office of Laboratory Services that provides advisory and scientific forensic support services. These facilities located in Washington, D.C., Walnut Creek, California and Atlanta, Georgia provide unparalleled scientific expertise and technical support for criminal investigations conducted under ATF?s jurisdiction. 

The new Fire Research Laboratory (FRL) will conduct forensic research, case support, training and education for fire investigation and analysis for ATF Certified Fire Investigators (CFIs), prosecutors, and the fire investigation community at-large. The FRL will provide fire scientists, engineers, researchers and investigators with the capability to perform a wide range of standard and unique tests. These potential tests range from small-scale fire tests to full-scale testing of entire residential structures. The FRL will have several large test cells (rooms) where full-scale test fires will be conducted. This unique capability will provide ATF the versatility necessary to reconstruct and test key aspects of most of the fire scenarios encountered by fire investigators in the field. 

The FRL will qualitatively study fire phenomena with regard to fire origin, growth, and spread in order to support the investigation of fires to accurately determine their origin and cause. To accomplish this mission, the FRL requires technical support services to supervise and direct skilled tradesmen in the fabrication of structural models / test assemblies of various sizes and scales from commercial building materials and supplies to recreate the physical conditions of various fire scenarios for laboratory analysis and validation. These services will be performed at the new ATF National Laboratory and Fire Research Center located in Beltsville, Maryland.

OBJECTIVE/SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall provide technical support services Monday through Friday, excepting federal holidays, eight hours per day, 40 hours per week for all services necessary to facilitate preparation, fabrication, maintenance and fire testing of structural models / test assemblies and equipment under laboratory conditions at the FRL. In some instances, these support services may require part-time flexible work schedules on an as needed basis that will be specified by the Government. Technical support services shall include all activities necessary to provide and supervise a skilled workforce of competent tradesmen to conduct test cell and associated systems maintenance, test model fabrication, model pre-test preparation and wiring, post-test maintenance/clean-up, and equipment installation, maintenance, repair and calibration. The contractor?s workforce shall exhibit a broad knowledge of general construction and building design principles and practices; specifically to include, but not limited to carpentry, electrical systems, electronics (component and instrument repair/maintenance), sheet metal, plumbing, and welding. The Contractor shall also supply additional technical resources (skills, materials, or equipment) for situations that involve unique test scenarios, as required by the Government. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for providing the resources necessary to accomplish the following specific tasks:

?	Fabrication and construction of test articles of varying sizes, structural modifications to existing test articles, fabrication of test components, installation of wiring, carpeting, insulation, interior furnishings and other items as specified in laboratory test plans. 

?	On-site assembly of pre-fabricated test articles (e.g., modular homes) in accordance with manufacturer supplied design and construction documents. 

?	Installation and modification of test cell instruments to include temperature / measurement devices (such as thermocouples and heat flux transducers), smoke meters, pressure transducers, gas analyzers, smoke detectors, infrared detectors, video cameras, tubing, filters and associated wiring necessary to measure fire test conditions within the test cell. 

?	Installation, calibration, repair and replacement of instrumentation installed in the measurement hoods in each test cell. Maintenance and repair includes tasks such as, but not limited to, servicing, removing and replacing readily available and accessible defective components in accordance with equipment manufacturer?s recommended maintenance schedules and instructions supplied to the Contractor by the government. The instrumentation consists of ductwork assemblies equipped with gas sampling probes (analyzers) to record carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) concentrations.

?	Maintenance and/or replacement of associated measurement equipment such as thermocouples (with government furnished equipment such as a thermocouple welder) and heat flux transducers as required. Routine maintenance may include replacing components of the gas analyzers and heat flux transducers when the equipment fails to produce accurate readings.

?	Repair of items / contents, (or assisting FRL staff with the repair of items/contents) such as monitor nozzles, pressure transducers, thermocouples, heat flux transducers, or similar support equipment installed in test cells in the event that they are damaged as a result of fire tests. 

?	Post-test clean-up of test cells that includes the removal of burned materials / debris / residue, sweeping the test area, hosing the test area down with water, and removing the wastewater to substantially return the test cell to its pre-fire condition. 

?	An Inventory Management System (IMS) and an Approved Purchasing System (APS) capable of monitoring, ordering and tracking construction materials / building supplies.

The NIH accomplishes that mission by: conducting research    in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Fed   eral scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals,    and research institutions throughout the country and abroad   ; helping in the training of research investigators; and fos   tering the communication of biomedical information.   As an organization, the NIH is unique. Management is intenti   onally decentralized into 24 Institutes and Centers, which c   ooperate and collaborate in the management and conduct of re   search. This decentralized environment fosters a broad range    of investigator-initiated research.   The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, a 240-bed biomedi   cal research hospital, is part of the NIH campus in Bethesda   , Maryland. The Clinical Center is the setting in which most    NIH intramural clinical trials are carried out, and it acco   unts for about half the NIH-funded dedicated clinical resear   ch beds in the country. About 7,000 patients per year are ad   mitted to the inpatient services, and 70,000 per year are se   en as outpatients.   Care for inpatients and outpatients in the Clinical Center i   s provided by staff physicians who, in general, are employed    by the 17 Institutes that have clinical programs on the NIH    intramural campus in Bethesda. The hospital is organized in   to floors and clinics, with each floor or clinic typically s   erving one or a small number of Institute programs. For exam   ple, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) cares for patients    admitted on NCI protocols on two floors and one clinic in th   e hospital. General guidelines to establish the standard of    care in the hospital are established by the Medical Executiv   e Committee (MEC), a body composed of the Director of the Cl   inical Center and the Clinical Directors of all the Institut   es with clinical programs. The MEC is responsible for patien   t safety and quality of care throughout the Clinical Center.    The Consult Review Committee is a chartered subcommittee of    the MEC that is responsible for assuring that consults perf   ormed within the Clinical Center meet the hospital's standar   ds for quality and safety.   Subspecialty consults are not performed by hospital staff, b   ut rather by staff belonging to the Institute that covers th   at particular subspecialty within its mission. Oncology cons   ults are provided by NCI, ophthalmology consults are provide   d by the National Eye Institute (NEI), Dental Consults by th   e National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NI   DCR), etc. Because of the relative autonomy of the Institute   s, it is difficult to capture information on consult quality    for use by the Consult Review Committee or for feedback to    the Institute providing the consult service.   The consult process starts when a provider enters an order f   or a consult into the Medical Information System (MIS) and i   s completed when the consultant files a consult on an NIH fo   rm M513 in the patient's chart. This form is printed by the    MIS when the consultant logs into the system and completes t   he consult order. The detailed operations of the consult ser   vice between these two processes are left largely up to the    Institute that runs the consult service. This Statement of W   ork is for the development of an ancillary Consult Evaluatio   n System (CES) that will automatically generate electronic e   valuation questionnaires for both the consult requestor and    the consultant, that will securely collect the information o   n these forms, and that will make the contents of these eval   uations available both individually and as aggregated data i   n reports.   Volumes   There are currently 39 consult services, although this numbe   r is expected to increase. These are:   Adult auditory assessment   Allergy and immunology   Anesthesiology   Cardiology   Children's hospital pediatric consult   Critical care medicine   Dental   Dermatology   Endocrinology   Gastroenterology   Genetics   Gynecology   Hematology   Hepatology   Infectious disease   Internal medicine   Nephrology   Neurology   Neurosurgery   Nutrition   Ophthalmology   Orthopedics   Otolaryngology   Pain and palliative care   Pediatric auditory assessment   Pediatric rheumatology   Podiatry   Psychiatry   Radiation therapy   Surgery, general   Therapeutic phlebotomy   Thoracic surgery   Transfusion medicine   Urology   Vascular access device   Vestibular assessment   Wound, ostomy, continence   Annual consult volumes, based on six months of data ending 3   /02, range from 4 consults per service to 1706 consults per    service. Total consult volume, based on six months of data e   nding 3/02, is 10,140 consults per year.   REQUIREMENTS   Infrastructure   The system shall use an established SQL compliant relational    database management system (DBMS) to store evaluation data.    This DBMS shall be one already in use in the NIH Clinical C   enter (e.g. Oracle, Sybase).   The DBMS shall run under an operating system (OS) already in    use in the NIH Clinical Center (e.g. Windows 2000, Windows    XP, Mac OS X, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX).   The application server, if one is used, shall run under an o   perating system (OS) already in use in the NIH Clinical Cent   er (e.g. Windows 2000, Windows XP, Mac OS X, Sun Solaris, IB   M AIX).   The system user interface shall be World Wide Web based.   The web-based interface shall run in a functionally equivale   nt manner on the following client platforms: Windows 98, Win   dows 2000, Windows NT 4, Windows XP, Mac OS 8.x, Mac OS 9.x,    Mac OS 10.x.   The web-based interface shall run in a functionally equivale   nt manner in the following web browsers: Microsoft Internet    Explorer version 5.1 or higher (Mac OS), Microsoft Internet    Explorer version 5.5 or higher (Windows).   The web-based interface shall require no installation of sof   tware on client computers other than a standard installation    of the OS and web browser software.   All data transmitted by the application over the NIH intrane   t or the public Intranet that contains patient identificatio   n shall be encrypted. A solution that requires servers to re   side behind a firewall for communication between the applica   tion server, DBMS server, and web server, is acceptable.   The system shall not require a real-time interface to the MI   S. The MIS is able to send reports to a virtual printer; the   se reports can be collected in a file system. A solution tha   t requires electronic parsing of information from these repo   rts is acceptable.   Functional   See attachment 1 - proposed process flowchart.   See attachment 2 - proposed consultant and requestor evaluat   ion forms.   See attachment 3 - NIH Form M513.   The system shall collect consult ordering information from t   he MIS within 24 hours of the time that the consult order is    entered in the MIS. This information shall include, at a mi   nimum, date of consult request, patient identification, reas   on for the consult, requestor identification, consult servic   e requested, MIS order number, patient location, patient ser   vice, and patient diagnosis.   The system shall send notification requesting evaluation of    the consult process to the consultant within 24 hours of com   pletion of the consult in the MIS. Note that the notificatio   n and the subsequent evaluation can be separate processes.   The system shall send notification requesting evaluation of    the consult process to the requesting provider 24 hours afte   r the Consult Evaluation System is notified that the consult    is completed in the MIS. Note that the notification and the    subsequent evaluation can be separate processes.   The system shall send reminders to the consultant and reques   tor at weekly intervals until the evaluations are completed    or until an established number of weeks have passed without    an evaluation.   The system shall have the ability to flag an evaluation as n   ot returned, and to forego further reminders.   The system shall collect the data entered on the consultant    and requestor evaluation forms in a relational database.   This relational database shall, at a minimum, include the fo   llowing information: date of consult request, patient identi   fication, reason for the consult, requestor identification,    consult service requested, MIS order number, patient diagnos   is, patient location, patient service, all fields from the e   valuation forms, date of evaluation, and evaluator identific   ation. The system may populate provider and patient tables t   hrough an interface or view into another system (e.g. the Cl   inical Data Repository, the MIS User Database).   The system shall send notification to the Consult Review Com   mittee upon the following events: completion of consultant e   valuation, completion of requestor evaluation, flagging of a   n evaluation as not returned.   The system shall send notification to the Consult Review Com   mittee based on the content of the evaluation forms. For exa   mple, a consult process rated unsatisfactory or unsafe by ei   ther the requestor or the consultant shall result in immedia   te notification of the Consult Review Committee.   The system shall provide, at a minimum, the following report   s: number of consults performed aggregated by consultant, nu   mber of consults performed aggregated by consult service, nu   mber of consults performed aggregated by requesting service    or location, summary evaluation statistics on consults perfo   rmed aggregated by consultant, summary evaluation statistics    on consults performed aggregated by consult service, and su   mmary evaluation statistics on consults performed aggregated    by requesting service or location   The system shall provide the ability to make ad hoc queries    of the consult review database using third party tools (e.g.    Crystal Reports) or directly through the Consult Evaluation    Application.

The major workscope includes drydocking the vessel and cleaning and painting the hull, decks, deck fittings, coaming, interior compartments and miscellaneous modifications and repairs noted in accordance with these specifications.  REST RICTION TO FOUR HOUR TOWING DISTANCE (see SOW  SW-5):  The specifications also call for the Government to deliver the barge to the contractors yard.  The towing vessel is restricted in its speed and in the duration and extent of its sea voyages because o f the vessels design and by the standards to which it was equipped and outfitted.  Thus, delivery beyond a four (4) hour radius (40) miles of Caven Point Terminal would be a costly and unsafe undertaking by the Government.  Large costs would be incurred f or the towing vessel, crew overtime and transportation back to Caven Point.  Unnecessary jeopardy of the vessel would be occasioned by a long towing voyage into waters whose sea state could rapidly change for the worse with the barge still under tow.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center intends to procure on a non-competitive basis, through Simplified Acquisition procedures with the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, to prepare two Case Studies on current transportation topics to be used in training sessions for senior U.S. DOT officials under the Transportation Executive Leadership Institute (TELI).  The contractor will be required to develop two separate Case Studies on current transportation issues, suitable for use in training sessions for senior U.S. DOT executives.  The purpose of the Case Study is to stimulate a discussion among the session participants of the specific topic, its impact on transportation, and the more general application of any 'lessons learned' to other transportation situatio ns.  The two Case Study topics to be developed are as follows: 1) The roles and responsibilities of government agencies in responding to incidents of bioterrorism.  The primary topic of the case study will be the discovery of anthrax-laced letters in the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mail system in the fall of 2001.  Specific emphasis will be placed on: (a) how the USPS responded to these incidents; and (b) the overlapping roles and responsibilities of the various other governmental organizations in addition to the USPS who were part of this response;  2) The general consequences of privatizing/outsourcing government transportation functions -- including such functions as air traffic control, rail, transit and commercial aviation -- to other entities, including quasi-governmental organization s and the private sector.  Both U.S. and foreign examples will be presented.  In particular, a discussion of recent proposals for restructuring Amtrak will be a focus of this case study.  Small Business firms classified under NAICS Code 611699 that are interested in responding must demonstrate in writing within 15 days from the date of this synopsis the following: (a) successful past performance in developing transportation-based Case Studies suitable for use in training senior U.S. Government transportation professionals; (b) a copy of a previously-developed Case Study meeting this criteria; (c) a comprehensive understanding of the specific topics in the two case Studies described above; and (d) immediate availability.   This proposed action is for services for which the Government intend s to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice will normally be considered, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. RFQ issuance will be on or about September 6, 2002. Telephone requests will not be accepted, only written requests for this RFQ will be accepted, however, we will accept requests via facsimile at (617) 494-3024.  This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has programs t o assist minority, women-owned and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital and bonding assistance for transportation-related contracts.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) for a negotiated Construction contract for the new NOAA Satellite Operations Facility located at the Suitland Federal Center in Suitland, Md. A single Firm Fixed Price Contract may be awarded. The estimated construction cost is in the $55 million dollar range. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards.  The selection process will utilize Source Selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.3. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  

The New Satellite Operations Facility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will be sited at the northern edge of the Suitland Federal Center, on the south side of Suitland Road. The new facility will consist of two main components: the "Bar" and the "Mat".  The Bar is a slender, three story tower consisting of 5,350 square meters of space dedicated to the mission of the Satellite Operations Group.  

The Mat is an extended, partly underground, two-story building of approximately 14,000 square meters.  This includes an underground parking structure on the lower level that will provide approximately 280 vehicular parking spaces for employees, with additional surface parking for approximately 55 vehicles. The Mat includes a level above the Parking Deck containing high-tech office space for the processing, dissemination and storage of the data transmitted by and received from the satellites. The Mat has a gently sloped, faceted roof that rises to the center of the space.  This additional height is utilized to accommodate a data service ring in the center of the space that houses the telecom duct banks, computer servers, plotters, data storage and LAN rooms supporting the office functions below.

An under floor air displacement HVAC system will be used in the double height open office space.  Supply air is introduced from a 12-inch high raised floor plenum. 

The design for the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility has been developed consistent with the Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines for the LEED Green Building Rating System. The project, as developed to date, meets the LEED-certification for the Silver Level.


This negotiated solicitation will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507, as part of its proposal. Consideration is open to established, qualified firms, which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United Sates (including subcontractors). The RFP will be issued electronically on or about October 10, 2002, on the Internet at: http:/www.fedbizopps.gov. All qualified responsible firms are encouraged to participate in this procurement. Small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.

If insufficient information reg arding the offerors corporate history is available, the offeror is encouraged to submit for evaluation evidence of relevant past performance on the part of the offerors key/principal employees, as either a prime- or sub-contractor.  Past performance is assessed by the SSA/Contracting Officer and is assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adjectival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other t han the lowest priced offer if doing so would result in greater value to the Government in terms of technical performance, quality, or lower overall program risk.

Describe how you maintain quality control and your quality assurance system. b. Subfactor - Customer Satisfaction  1.  For each similar and/or identical system provide no more than five previous contracts (US Government contracts preferred), two points of contact, and phone numbers of customers that have purchased  the system(s) in quantities of at least 50 during the past 12 months.    2.  For each similar and/or identical system provide no more than five previous contracts (US Government contracts preferred), points of contact, and phone numbers of customers that you have delivered similar TWTs.   Provide information on the similar/identical system production quantities manufactured during the past 12 months.   The Government may use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the Offeror and that information may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  The information may be used to evaluate the Offeror's past performance in meeting costs/price, technical, delivery objectives and customer satisfaction.  The results may be used in the overall comparative evaluation of the offer in accordance with 52.212-2 and  addendum.  52.212-2 Addendum: Evaluation:    Paragraph (a)  Factor:  Past Performance and Price.  Delete paragraph (b).

Sum of line items. LOT II 144 ea CLIN 0001 years 1,2,and 3. Sum of line items.  Only one Lot will be awarded. Evaluation of the maximum quantity shall not obligate the Government to procure more than the minimum quantity. Past performance is significantly more important than price.  Price will not be rated, but will be considered in determining the "best value" to the Government.  The price becomes more important as the degree of equality between offerors' proposals increase, or when the price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technic al superiority to the Government. 52.212-3 and 252.212-7000 (Offeror shall complete and return with Offer).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA-Ames Research Center plans to purchase a Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS). Statement of Work  NASA Ames is engaged in a long-term research program related to the operation of intelligent robots on other planets.  As part of this research program, Ames developed the K9 rover, a prototype planetary surface robot with a chassis developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and electronics developed at Ames Research Center.  The K9 group is currently adding capabilities and instrumentation to the rover which are important to researchers who wish to test their technology using the rover.   An important part of the research performed on the rover is navigation to science targets, avoiding obstacles.  In order to test these abilities and demonstrate the robustness required for actual flight to Mars, the rover team must make many repeated test runs in an outdoor simulated Mars environment, and accurately measure the rover's path.  The rover team must also compare the rover's model of where science targets and obstacles are in the environment to their actual location. Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) appear to be the most reasonable way to locate the rover accurately over a large area and without a line-of-sight requirement between the rover and a base station.  DGPS requires a base station of known location and a mobile station.  If more than one simultaneous measurement is required, multiple mobile stations can make use of the information from the single base station. Power requirements and size are important for the mobile rover system. The DGPS has the following requirements: 1. Simultaneous measurements: Location measurements must be simultaneously available on both the rover and also a hand held unit.  2. Accuracy:  Accuracy is particularly important when moving the rover arm to measure a sample from a rock.  Location measurements must be accurate to within 1.5 centimeters for both horizontal and vertical directions.  3. Update rate: The rover and hand held units must provide at least 20 updates per second (10 Hz);  faster is better.	4. Measurement range: This system will be used during extended field tests outside Ames.	The maximum distance between the base station and the rover or mobile station is 2 kilometers.  Line of sight cannot be required between base station and rover.	5. Communications link: If a communications link is required by the DGPS between base and mobile stations, it must be standard RS-232, 38400 baud or less, and function with up to 1 second of latency.  (The RS-232 information will be routed over an existing radio network;  the vendor is not required to provide a wireless link. 6. Power(rover): Power draw is of critical importance on the rover, since the rover is powered by solar cells.	The rover mobile unit must  use no more than  4 watts of power, and must be compatible with a 12 volt DC supply.  7. Size (rover):	Space is of critical importance inside the chassis of the rover.  The rover mobile unit must be no larger than 4" x 7" x 1"  8. Size (hand held): The hand held mobile unit must be enclosed and should be reasonably small (10" x 5" x 3" or smaller is desired). The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-08. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.   The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 421490 and 100, respectively. The quoter shall state in their quotation their size status for this procurement. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to NASA-Ames Research Center is required within 5 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.	The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-08.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541219 with a small business size standard of $7.0 million.

It is the intent of the Office of Finance (OF); Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology and Finance (ASBFT); Office of the Secretary; Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to purchase specialized professional accounting services for OF's Division of Accounting and Fiscal Policy (DAFP) from Anthony J. Deutsch, Fredericksburg, Virginia 22407.  DAFP requires the specialized accounting services for a period of three years.  

With the passage of the Chief Financial Officer Act requiring audited statements for Departments and a spate of new laws increasing the accounting and reporting requirements, the HHS accounting guidance requires revision.  The consultant will provide assistance to DAFP in updating/developing accounting guidance to prepare for the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) implementation. Specifically, DAFP requires the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of the complexities of Federal accounting and Federal systems who can successfully accomplish the following tasks:  (1) make recommendations for updates to policy guidance for HHS Operating Divisions, (2) support DAFP as a knowledgeable resource in Federal GAAP accounting for inclusion in guidance, (3) support DAFP in understanding systems design and the impact of the planned HHS UFMS including the need for clear accounting guidance to support the UFMS project, (4) provide instruction and training on accounting issues to HHS employees, (5) support DAFP in understanding internal controls and developing internal control tests and documentation, and (6) perform other required tasks that support HHS OF in their endeavors to prepare for a new HHS-wide accounting system and assist in  modernizing and updating related policies and procedures.  

DAFP has determined that Mr. Anthony Deutsch possesses the unique combination of knowledge, skills and Federal experience that are necessary to accomplish the specified tasks.  Mr. Deutsch has over 33 years of Federal employment experience and four years as an independent consultant to Federal agencies. He has experience in accounting operations and reporting and with Federal financial systems. He assisted in the development and testing of the first Financial Management System Schedule (FMSS) bench mark test used by GSA to test the financial system software of various vendors prior to admittance to the FMSS of approved software.  While with Treasury Agency Services he coordinated and participated in various financial management conferences and developed and presented various training programs.  He served as project director and senior analyst responsible for performing a review of three U. S. Coast Guard financial management information systems for compliance with Federal financial management standards.  Mr. Deutsch completed a situational assessment of the USDA's Forest Service Working Capital Fund.  He performed benchmarking and best practice reviews of similar organizations in the private sector in order to develop a best practices document to be used by the Forest Service.  Mr. Deutsch served as a consultant and team leader with OMB staff in the review and update of OMB Circulars A-123, A-127, and A-130.  He developed checklists for OMB Circulars, the Joint Financial Management Improvement Programs (JFMIP) Core Financial System Requirements and FASAB standards to be used by OMB and various agencies for financial systems reviews.  

Mr. Deutsch will not require orientation to Federal accounting systems activities and is the only source with the unique qualifications that can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Karen D.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: RESTRICTED TO 8(a) FIRMS SERVICED BY THE HAWAII SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DISTRICT OFFICE AND OTHER 8(a) PARTICIPANTS WITH BONA-FIDE PLACES OF BUSINESS IN HAWAII. (No solicitation will be available. This is an announcement that is open indefinitely.) The Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC), Pearl Harbor is seeking interest from 8(a) program participants serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii to participate in a Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) Program. (If you are currently a Hawaii-Based BOA Holder, no further action is required on your part.) BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific Division, Resident Officer in Charge of Construction, Pearl Harbor, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. Annually, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to a chosen few contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders serviced by the Hawaii District Office and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Hawaii. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold of not less than $25,000 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. The anticipated construction work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). The NAICS Sectors covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sectors 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military and government installations on the Islands of Hawaii, the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. freely-associated island-nations of the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years with the Government's right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is exiting from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will be terminated. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $25,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) Certification. (2) Registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (3) Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code Series 233, 234, and 235. (4) Provide resumes indicating the qualifications of key personnel of the Design-Build Team, if applicable, to include principals (design and construction), project manager (design and construction), registered professionals for each design discipline (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and fire protection engineer), and sustainable design consultant, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. Provide a narrative that describes the Design-Build Team?s internal communication system used to ensure a successful project, if being considered for design and/or design-build projects. (5) Provide up to three references of completed projects within the last three years for EACH NAICS sector that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size and general scope and the possible complexity to which the firm would like to be considered. A request for a BOA may be denied if a contractor has an Experience Modifier Rate (EMR) greater than 1.2 and/or an incidence rate higher than 5.0. To register in the DOD CCR database, go to the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/, go to "Start New Registration", and follow the directions for registration. All requirements under the BOA Program will be offered via E-mail or posted on NAVFAC's Electronic Solicitation (E-Sol) website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing solicitation documents. All BOA holders are encouraged to visit the E-Sol website frequently for the solicitation documents issued under the BOA Program. All BOA holders shall create an account for each solicitation in which they wish to participate at the website http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil to ensure that they are notified of updates or amendments to the solicitation as they occur. No other notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors. BOAs will be processed in the order in which a complete evaluation package is received. BOAs will be used for competitive purposes. Unless you respond to this synopsis or subsequent synopses, which will be issued periodically, you will not be able to participate in this BOA program.

<DESC>NA The US Marine Corps (USMC) is conducting a survey of fabrics and liners for a potential New Physical Fitness Uniform (NPFU).  Prototypes of design concepts will be displayed at the upcoming Modern Day Marine show being held on September 17 through the 19th  at Quantico Marine Corps Base, Quantico Virginia. The USMC is looking for fabrics and liners with properties that will give the Marine the most comfort and durability during physical training (PT) and be comfortable enough to wear during liberty time. Imp ortant features to be considered for the outer shell are moisture management, water repellency, tensile and tear strength, anti-microbial properties, durable to repeated home launderings, quiet, low air permeability, good soil and stain release properties,  good abrasion properties and fabric hand and appearance.  Fabrics that possess a micro fiber hand are highly desirable in as long as they meet durability requirements.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), soliciting industry interest, input and capabilities for the development of rapid cure coatings for use by the US Navy for corrosion control and protection of shipboard ballast, fuel, Combined Holding Tanks (CHT) and potable water tanks.  Significant Navy forces and resources are spent in the maintenance of the Ships within the Fleet.  Current coatings technology being used by the US Navy for the preservation of tanks is limited primarily to two (2) component solvent-free epoxy coatings. These coatings have significant disadvantages, in that: 
a)	Current coatings require 8-12 hours (cure to walk-on) of controlled environmental conditions and ventilation to assure proper cure and minimal damage to freshly applied system.  Such requirements place considerable time constraints on adjacent application and preservation activities do to risks associated with possible damage to freshly applied coating in neighboring tanks or spaces. 
b)	The cumulative time requirements associated with conventional coatings results in a significant portion of current ship's availability period dedicated to the allowance of proper coating curing.  
c)	The physical application parameters of existing coatings are not ideal when considering typical Navy shipyard locations and applications conditions.
Therefore, the Navy, under the Office of Naval Research (ONR), has a desire to investigate the availability and/or development of "rapid cure" coatings for shipboard tank applications meeting these desired performance standards.  Applicable coatings properties to include:
	Application under current industrial practices, as are present in a shipbuilding and ship repair environment;
	Application using commercially available plural component equipment, as is currently employed in industrial operations to include shipyards, general construction or infrastructure maintenance;
	Rapid Cure coating systems, consisting of epoxy, polyurea, polyurethane, or polyurethane hybrids, wherein, the cured system exhibits performance criteria to include the following properties:
o	Performance criteria, as outlined in MIL-PRF-23236B (SH)
o	Cure to walk-on times ranging from 5 seconds to 25 minutes at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, Fully cured for service optimally @ 1 day, at 75 degrees Fahrenheit
o	Solvent free (95 g/l or less)
o	Free of aromatic amines (methylene dianiline)
o	Minimum of 70 percent edge retention at 12 mils DFT on a 1.0 mm radius applied in one-pass
o	Simple pleural component mix ratios (i.e., 1:1, or 2:1)
o	Suitable for seawater ballast, fuel and potable water tank application (to include NSF approval)
Coatings of interest need to exhibit application and performance properties as generally demonstrated by the current commercial industrial coatings employed for the preservation of steel and aluminum surfaces against corrosion in a seawater environment.  The coatings shall not require specialized surface preparation and or application criteria beyond those currently outlined in the U.S. Navy's, Naval Ship's Technical Manual (NSTM) chapter 631 or outlined in Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Standard 009-32 for abrasive blast cleaning and coating application.  In addition the coatings shall possess the ability to provide optimum performance under the application range of 18-30 mils Dry Film Thickness (DFT).  All coatings shall also have the option of a repair material for touch-up of damaged areas, as is required for areas where routine maintenance and or structural repairs have been performed.

<DESC>A SET-ASIDE DETERMINATION HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS ACQUISITION.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS BEING POSTED IN THE SET-ASIDE SECTION TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST DISSEMINATION TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY.  PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS RFI ADDRESSES ALL OF THE INFORMATION REQUESTED IN THE RFI INFORMATION SOUGHT SECTION.  IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU COMMENT ON THE GROUP COMPOSITION.  IF YOUR COMPANY EXPRESSES INTEREST IN A GROUPING AND IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE NSNs WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR GROUPING, YOU MUST STATE THAT FACT AND SPECIFICALLY STATE WHY.  THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO THE GOVERNMENT IN MAKING SET ASIDE DETERMINATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO GROUP COMPOSITION.  Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is in the process of preparing solicitations in support of competitive spare parts for the A-10 Aircraft/TF-34 Engine.  There will be one unrestricted solicitation and one solicitation set aside for small businesses.  Multiple awards will be made from each solicitation.  It is envisioned that the resultant contracts will be for a basic contract period of three years with two twenty-four month option periods and one thirty six month option period, for a total maximum period of performance of ten years.  The Government's goal in this program is to increase mission readiness levels by increasing stock availability, reducing contractor processing time, and reducing time on back order.  

Another DSCR objective is to use Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) for any items that, after evaluation of proposals, are determined by business case analysis to be provided more efficiently by contractor support.  It is envisioned that this procurement will allow offerors to indicate those items that they propose to provide via DVD.  The Government reserves the right to designate or recommend DVD items prior to solicitation.  DVD items are generally fast moving items that have many users, frequent demand, and varying quantities.  Under a DVD arrangement the contractor is responsible for providing a complete range of services to support the DVD items.  These services include: forecasting, purchasing, inventory management, quality control, receipt, storage, packing, and transportation. 
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS: Performance metrics will apply to the resultant contracts.  At this time it is envisioned that within a period of one year after contract award, the following performance metrics will be used to evaluate contractor performance: 1.	CPT for DVD Routine Requisitions, within 5 days 95% of the time, 2.CPT for DVD High Priority Requisitions, within 2 days, 95% of the time,3.Time on Backorder for DVD, maximum number of days 20, 95% of the time 4.CPT for DLA Stock, PLT for NSN, 95%.  DEFINITIONS:  CPT (Contractor Processing Time) is defined as the number of days from the delivery order issue date to the date that the total quantity ordered is shipped.
Time on Backorder is defined as the delivery order ship date minus the delivery order due date.
PLT (Production Lead Time) goal is negotiated on an NSN by NSN basis. 

SURGE AND SUSTAINMENT:  In addition to the delivery metrics, Surge and Sustainment requirements do apply to some NSNs covered under this procurement.  A list of the covered NSNs can be found at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/proc/VPV/A10Air/a10air.htm.  For your information, sample Surge and Sustainment clauses can be found at the same web site.  


SYSTEMS INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: Contractors will be required to interface with DLA's Standard Automated Materiel Management System (SAMMS) and Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).  In this case the contractor must be capable of sending, receiving, and processing the ANSI X12 transaction sets (3050 implementation convention) 850 (Purchase/Delivery Order), 856 (Shipment Notice), and 997 (Functional Acknowledgement). An electronic mailbox on a DAASC certified Value Added Network (VAN) would also be required. Contractors may be required to interface with the Government's Global Transportation Network (GTN) to enable the government to track and trace contractor shipments.  

NSN CATEGORIES:  The Government has divided the NSNs covered by the acquisition into (number) manufacturing categories.  Depending on the responses to this RFI, it is possible that the Government will make each category  all or none, meaning that the contractor must propose and be able to provide all NSNs in the category in order to be considered responsive.  All NSNs listed in this RFI are categorized G (meaning that the Government has unlimited rights to the technical data of the NSN and the package is complete).  

SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE: DLA is setting aside those NSNs with a previous small business buy history for small business concerns.  As it is a goal of DSCR to aggressively seek small business participation, the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if adequate small business capability and interest exist to justify the setting aside of additional NSNs that have not historically been supplied by the small business community.   In order to set the acquisition aside, DSCR must determine if two or more interested small businesses are capable of meeting the requirements outlined in this RFI.  

Although general information is provided in this RFI, contractors are strongly encouraged to review the draft Statement of Work.  The draft Statement of Work and a list of the NSN groupings, nomenclatures, annual demand values for the last four years, four quarter frequency, four-quarter quantity, and expected Production Lead Time (PLT) can be found at (http://www.dscr.dla.mil/proc/VPV/A10Air/a10air.htm).  

INFORMATION SOUGHT: To indicate an ability to meet the requirements of this potential acquisition, small businesses should submit the following general information to the address shown below NLT the closing date of this synopsis:

1.Corporate Information to include an indication of type of Small Business (e.g. 8A, Hubzone, WOSB, SDVet, etc); 2. A list of the specific NSN groupings that your company is interested in and capable of providing; 3. Descriptions of your relationship with suppliers for make or buy parts.  In the case of buy parts, include a statement that the parts will be purchased from another small business manufacturing concern in accordance with FAR 19.502-2(c); 4. NSNs for which you would be interested in providing DVD services; 5.Past experience in providing/manufacturing similar parts in support of Government or other similar contracts; 6. Comments on the NSN groupings.  If you recommend the addition/deletion of an NSN from a grouping, you must provide the rationale for doing so; and 7. Any other comments on the requirement.  PLEASE BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE.

Responses to this RFI should be forwarded in Microsoft Word via e-mail to Catherine Contreras at Catherine.Contreras@dscr.dla.mil no later than 20 September 2002.   Industry is reminded that this is a Request for Information, not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Please do not submit a complete proposal with prices at this time.  

The Government reserves the right to structure the acquisition in any number of ways to enhance competition and optimize operational efficiencies.  Individual NSNs or groups of NSNs may be added or deleted as necessary to enhance competition.  The Government also reserves the right to add or delete any combination of services.

<DESC>The 21st Contracting Squadron is seeking sources for manufactures or sellers for 494 vehicle repeaters and all associated hardware to three different wings to include support, installation and extended warranty. ( Malmstrom AFB, Minot AFB, and FE Warren AFB.)  For Minot AFB, 125 each SVR-200UA/206-420 MHZ; Malmstrom AFB, 185 each SVR-200VB/150-174 MHZ; and for FE Warren AFB, 184 each SVR-200VB/150-174 MHZ.  Vehicle repeaters specifications include: (a) In-band repeating.  Military radio frequencies are limited to one spectrum band per wing.  The SVR-200 has the ability to repeat within one spectrum band.  Established military frequencies of 403-420MHZ and has a 25kHz and 12.5kHz channel spacing. (b) Product size; the SVR-200 size must be small enough to fit inside the SF vehicle atop the mounted vehicle radio, allowing for ease of installation and removal (c) Repeater De-Key and Priority Repeater Function:  The repeater will de-key periodically to check if other repeaters are operating in the same area; if so the repeater will cease transmissions so multiple repeaters are not over repeating the radio transmission.  The SVR-200 will continue to monitor all radio transmissions even when it is not the priority repeater and take action to become the priority repeater when the absence of a priority repeater is detected (d) Minimum Power Output.  The SVR-200 outputs less than 2Watts.  It transfers the transmission to the mobile radio for boosting the signal power and transmission.  This is critical when transmission signal strengths have been coordinated between the United States and Canada.  Minot AFB SF operate near the Canadian boarder and signal strengths have already been negotiated (e) Interface with Existing Radio:  The SVR-200 interfaces without any modification to the existing SF mobile radios. Standard cabling and wiring is used (f) Upward Compatible with Newer Radio Technology.  The SVR-200 used the existing radio technology to simply transfer the signal. It can be used with future radio upgrades without modification.  RESPONSES REQUIRED NO LATER THAN 31 AUGUST 2002/1300.  Any questions or requests for additional information may be directed to A1C Michelle Zeller (COMM#719-556-7395) or TSgt Greg Jensen (COMM#719-556-7660).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) requires a high power, narrow linewidth, laser intended for two applications.  ***  The first application is a high power optical dipole trap for ultracold atoms.  The depth of such a trap is proportional to the power, which must be at least 6 W of laser light in the wavelength range from 1000-1100 nm.  The laser must be far off-resonance (767 and 780 nm) to prevent heating of the atoms due to light scattering, while remaining in the range of the optics and light detectors, which generally fall off for wavelengths higher than 1064 nm (the wavelength of the widely used Nd:YAG type laser).  The wavelength must also be > 780 nm in order for the potential to be attractive, rather than repulsive.  The dipole trap laser must also have a nearly pure TEM00 spatial mode, linear polarization,  amplitude stability better than 1%, and intensity noise lower than 1%. ***  The second application for the laser is an optical lattice for the atoms.  This application requires somewhat less power, but is critically dependent upon the laser having an narrow linewidth (<10 MHz full-width at half-max).   The optical lattice trap requires at least 3 W of laser light in the wavelength range from 1000-1100, a nearly pure TEM00 spatial mode, linear polarization, intensity noise lower than 1%, and frequency noise lower than 1% in the range from DC to a few MHz. ***   This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13.1 (NTE $100K) as a best value acquisition. FAR provisions are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/. *** Evaluation factors include (1) price,  (2) technical merit specifically applicable to the intended application and (3) delivery date of five weeks or fewer ARO.  Responses must specifically address all performance criteria in this solicitation. ***  This is a combined solicitation/announcement.  No separate solicitation is available.   The anticipated award date is September 23, 2002.

FAR 52.212-2 will be used for evaluation purposes, and will be supplemented by Factors (a), (b), and (c), below.  Evaluation criteria are used for the determination of technical suitability, which is compliance with the specification for the DRGPS in Attachment 1 (under separate cover).  Compliance is necessary for any favorable award determination.  Therefore, the Government will evaluate: (a) the Offeror's compliance with these specifications (you must request Attachment 1 from the Contract Specialist).  The Offerors must demonstrate through a compliance matrix that they either comply or take exception to the specified requirements in Attachment 1.  Use of the appropriate commercial literature is acceptable in tandem with the compliance matrix.  If an exception is taken, the Offeror must explain how it can otherwise meet the performance requirements; (b) the Offeror's past performance will be evaluated for similarity and recentness of the referenced buy, and the Contractor's overall performance, including meeting the delivery schedule and reliability of the equipment (submit three past performance references for the same or similar units, delivered over the past three years, including price/unit, technical and business points of contact and telephone numbers); and (c) the warranty terms must be submitted and will be evaluated for their appropriateness to sustaining the Government's mission requirements and avoiding service discontinuity.  Price will not be scored, but will become more important if technical scores are relatively equal.. Technical suitability will be allocated with the following weights: (A) Compliance with Specifications: 70%, (B) Past Performance: 20%, and (C) Warranty Terms: 10%.  Determination for ward will be based on an integrated assessment of these technical factors with price.
