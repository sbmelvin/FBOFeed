<DESC>This is a Design/Build Best Value Source Selection firm fixed price construction solicitation.  This procurement is for one solicitation that will result in one award.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized a need for facilities located remote from the Roybal Campus which will provide support for the critical operations of the CDC in an event that these operations cannot be supported from the Roybal Campus.  Building A is largely unoccupied at the current time and provides an existing structure which can meet the space requirements of the project.  The base building electrical and mechanical services are adequate to meet the needs of this project with some equipment replacement and reworking of the distribution systems required.  This location also provides an existing secure perimeter and adequate open space.  Building A was originally designed as an animal breeding facility and majority of the space was made up of long narrow animal rooms.  Approximately 31,000 square feet has been demolished in preparation for the new construction.   The scope of this project includes the renovation of a portion of Building A.  This will include storage space for National Centers for Infectious Disease?s (NCID) Lab Response Network (LRN), and base building improvements to the existing Director?s Emergency Operations Center space (DEOC).  The existing DEOC space will remain relatively unchanged with modifications required to accommodate the new construction.  Work within this project will include interior renovation, exterior renovation, upgrades and additions to the existing electrical systems, HVAC systems, fire protection systems, installation of a new roofing system, and the removal, relocation, and installation of a satellite dish located at the Roybal Campus and providing the associated support needed.  The estimated cost range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.00.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Photogrammetric Recession Measurement Systems. NASA Ames has a requirement for hardware that acquires images for making photogrammetric measurements and developing new techniques in support of photogrammetry.  The system shall have the following operation specifications: 1)	Cameras must acquire images continuously and the acquisition system must record the image stream continuously to disk storage.  2)	Cameras and frame grabbers must permit external synchronization for precisely simultaneous image capture and timestamping. Timestamping can be based on computer system clock, but an external timestamp source is desirable.  3)	Software that controls the cameras must permit viewing the image streams during recording.  4)	Software/hardware must permit the changing of the integration time during recording.  5)	Each camera shall be fitted with an f-mount adaptor. 6)	All systems must permit synchronizing to an external trigger source (TTL trigger). 7)	All systems must be compatible with NASA-owned hardware used for the Photogrammetric Recession Measurements. This hardware includes Dalsa 4M15 cameras, CLFC frame grabber boards, Fiber channel RAID for direct to disk recording.  Vendors will provide a firm fixed price quotation for three imaging systems which conform to the operation specifications listed above using the same software, cameras, and data acquisition configured as follows: System 1:	 a) 1 ea. Digital camera, 2048 x 2048 x 10bit pixels, up to 60 Hz frame rate with ability to be externally synched, CameraLink interface. b) 2 ea. 5 meter CameraLink cable, c) 1 ea. Stream-to-disk frame grabber board, direct-to-RAID through fiber channel.  d) 1 ea. Computer with 4 Terabytes record capacity, capable of continuous recording of both cameras simultaneously with timestamp in each image and 1 TB of internal hard disk space.	  e) 1 ea. Camera control and recording software for direct stream-to-disk image recording. f) 2 ea. 24-inch Flat panel monitor. System 2:	 a) 2 ea. Digital cameras, 2048 x 2048 x 10 bit pixels, up to 60 Hz frame rate with ability to be externally synched, CameraLink interface.  b) 4 ea. 5 meter CameraLink cables, c) 2 ea.  Stream-to-disk frame grabber boards, Direct to RAID through fiber channel.  d) 1 ea. Computer with 8 Terabytes record capacity, capable of continuous recording of both cameras simultaneously with timestamp in each image, and 1 TB of internal hard disk space.	 e) 1 ea. Camera control software for direct stream-to-disk recording,  f) 2 ea. 24-inch Flat panel monitor. System 3:	 a) 2 ea. Digital camera, 2048 x 2048 x 10bit pixels, up to 15 Hz frame rate with ability to be externally synched, CameraLink interface. b) 2 ea. 5 meter CameraLink cable, c) 2 ea. Stream-to-disk frame grabber board, direct-to-RAID through fiber channel.  d) 1 ea. Computer with 4 Terabytes record capacity, capable of continuous recording of both cameras simultaneously with timestamp in each image and 1 TB of internal hard disk space.	  e) 1 ea.
