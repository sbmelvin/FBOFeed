<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Program Support Center (PSC), Financial Management Portfolio (FMP), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Entrust Inc., located at 5420 LBJ Freeway, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, for the purchase of 3,147 Public Transport Layer Security Certificates. The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Entrust shall provide Public Transport Layer Security certificates to support the HSPD-12 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart card capability in compliance with the Federal Common Policy Framework, inclusive of Public Transport Layer Security certificates.</p>
<p>The purchase of the Public Transport Layer Security certificates will be a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), as part of an overall award to Entrust against its GSA Schedule, in response to solicitation number 18-233-SOL-00825. The competitive solicitation was posted to GSA eBUY on September 5, 2018, with a closing date of October 10, 2018. Entrust was the only firm to respond to the solicitation. The quote specified that the Public Transport Layer Security certificates were not on GSA schedule. These certificates are needed to meet the objectives of the task order. The Public Transport Layer Security certificates are required to operate HSPD-12 compliant PIV cards and over 3,000 HHS.GOV internally and externally facing webpages. Therefore, an award with an open market CLIN will be made to Entrust.</p>
<p>Entrust was the only firm to respond to solicitation number 18-233-SOL-00825. Entrust meets the all mandatory PKI service provider requirements. Entrust is an approved GSA PKI provider, cross-certified with the Federal PKI bridge. Entrust provides certificates and certificate maintenance activities to support the Program's Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart card capability in compliance with the Federal Common Policy Framework. This framework provides guidance for the implementation of a PKI service to enable secure communication, authentication of entities and electronic content, and the exchange of secure attribute-level assertions. Entrust is certified by the Federal PKI Policy Authority as a PKI Shared Service Provider. Entrust provides open standard-compliant certificates, including PKI software certificates, Private Transport Layer Security certificates, and Public Transport Layer Security certificate.</p>
<p>Entrust will provide HHS with a seamless continuation of Public Key Infrastructure Services for the Continued Implementation of HSPD-12. HHS relies on PKI certificates for over 218,000 HSPD-12 compliant PIV cards and over 3000 HHS.GOV internally and externally facing webpages that without Entrust support will be rendered inoperable and webpages inaccessible to employees, contractors and the general public. A sole source to Entrust for the Public Transport Layer Security certificates allow HHS to continue compliant maintenance of its public facing websites, as required by OMB M-15-13.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES.</p>
<p>All responsible sources that have determined they meet the all mandatory PKI service provider requirements and are an approved GSA PKI provider, cross-certified with the Federal PKI bridge, may submit a capabilities statement. Capabilities statements should clearly indicate business size. The email subject line must reference "Public Transport Layer Security Certificates for the Continued Implementation of HSPD-12." All responses are due by February 22, 2019 at 12:00 pm Eastern Time and sent to tory.estabrook@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this CLIN is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Security Upgrades project at the Gary IN P&amp;DC located at 1499 Martin Luther King Drive, Gary IN 46401-9997. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,500,000 to $1,700,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification/Evaluation Package with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1)Contractors must provide a copy of a General Contractors license as required by the State named in this solicitation, or copy of an application to obtain such license(s) to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2)Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five consecutive years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3)Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4)Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification. An EMR in excess of 1.0 may be grounds for eliminating a firm from further consideration by the evaluation team.<br />(5)Company must submit information for three comparable security upgrade projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification / Evaluation Package will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2 of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON TUESDAY MARCH 5, 2019, AT 10:00 A.M. CENTRAL TIME AT THE USPS GARY P&amp;DC LOCATED AT 1499 MARTIN LUTHER KING DRIVE, GARY IN. 46401-9997 - MAINTENANCE ROOM. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Thomas Pio, Thomas.M.Pio@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn .P.Lyne@usps.gov or Michael Douglass, Michael.J.Douglass@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon Eastern Time on March 11, 2019.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS eSourcing venue. Registration in EMPTORIS is REQUIRED. Registration instructions are attached to this posting. Once you have completed the registration, please email the individuals listed above so an Emptoris invitation can then be sent granting you access to the solicitation and corresponding documents.</p>
