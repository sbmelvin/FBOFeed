The Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Health Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan ("VA") requires contractors to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans and in some cases Veterans and their families from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. 

C.	BACKGROUND

Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain offers from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness (including substance use disorders), including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities. 

D.  SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

BASIC SERVICES   Emergency shelter beds shall be available in the city of Toledo, OH or the surrounding area.  The contractor shall furnish each Veteran referred for care under this contract with the following basic services: 

a. ROOM AND BOARD: Room and Board to include a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage, and personal linens (towels and bed sheets). Meals to include at least two (2) nutritionally adequate meals a day, 7 days a week and availability of nutritious snacks between meals and bedtime for those requiring or desiring additional food, when it is not medically contraindicated.

c. THERAPEUTIC AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES: Therapeutic and Rehabilitative Services determined to be needed by each individual Veteran referred for treatment as stated in the plan developed by the contractor, with input from the Veteran and the VA Homeless Program Coordinator (or designee).  Services which the contractor must be able to furnish shall include:


(1)	Structured group activities as appropriate - examples include group therapy, social skills training, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, vocational counseling and physical activities as appropriate.

(4)	Assistance to develop responsible living patterns, to maintain an acceptable level of personal hygiene and grooming, and to achieve a more adaptive level of psychosocial functioning, upgraded social skills, and improved personal relationships.

(5)	Support for an alcohol/drug abuse-free lifestyle provided in an environment conducive to social interaction and the fullest development of the resident's rehabilitative potential.

(6)	Assistance to gain and to apply knowledge of the illness/recovery process in an environment supportive of recovery models.

(7)	A program that promotes community interaction.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.(2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Description of Action:<br><br>Requirement:	X  New 			<br>Pricing:		X  Firm-Fixed Price         	 <br>Funds:		X OMA   			0  Other Funds:<br><br><br>Name of Proposed Contractor:	Immix Technology<br>Street Address:	8444 West Park Drive, Ste 200<br>City, State, Zip:	McLean, VA 22102-5112<br>Phone:	703-752-0590<br><br>3.  Description of Supply/Services:  <br><br>	The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 51,418.38<br><br>	This supply requirement is for the procurement of ImmixGroup (Q-Matic) 	hardware/software, maintenance, licenses, and training in support of Carl R. 	Darnall Army Medical Center, Ft. Hood, TX.  The period of performance is 8 	August 2011 through 7 August 2012.  <br><br>4.  Authority Cited:  This action is authorized under the provision of 10 U.S.C.  2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited: <br><br>	The current software solution in use is provided by ImmixzGroup.  Procurement 	of any other software solution would be costly because of the need for 	compatibility with the existing programs.<br><br>	Award to any other source other than the Immix Technology will result in 	unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  There would be a 	substantial duplication of cost to procure this supply that the Government does 	not expect to be recovered through competition.<br><br>6.  Actions to Increase Competition:  This is a one-time requirement and no future similar acquisitions are anticipated.  However, if a similar requirement arises every effort will be made to compete it to the maximum extent practicable.<br><br>7.  Market Research:  <br><br>	On 30 March 2011, Intent to Award Sole Source Synopsis was submitted through 	Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) with a closing date of 22 April 2011.  Two 	contractors expressed an interest in responding to the intent to award sole 	purchase order.  The requesting activity provided a questionnaire to determine if 	the 2 interested parties had the capabilities to provide the hardware/software, 	maintenance, licenses, and training which would be compatible with the current 	system.  <br><br>	The results of the questionnaire sent to the two interested parties did not 	demonstrate that either of the parties was proposing a hardware/software, 	maintenance, licenses, and training solution, which would be compatible with the 	current system.<br><br>8.  Procurement History: <br> <br>Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number:  W91151-10-P-0509; W91151-08-F-0185; W91151-08-F-0186		<br><br>Previously competed: No<br><br>Previous authority for less than Full & Open Competition: Yes<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>9.

Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.  The price analysis technique at FAR Part 15 will be used to determine a fair and reasonable price. <br><br>11.  Contracting Officer's Approval:  Based on the foregoing, the requirement described herein on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority cited above, subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services and property herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition. <br><br>Name: Carolyn J.
