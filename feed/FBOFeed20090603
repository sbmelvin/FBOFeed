<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION: The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) is a wing at the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base. SBIRS missions are missile warning, missile defense, battlespace characterization and technical intelligence. This RFI concerns Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) work that is required by the Wing. The SE&amp;I work will be spread across the SBIRS Wing programs which include DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment (DOSSC), SBIRS Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) and SBIRS Follow-On Production (SFP). The prime contractors for the Wings programs are Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. <br />INDUSTRY DAY: The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Program Office will hold an Industry Day on 29 May 2009 for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for a System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; both small and large business participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712. The Industry Day will be held at the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. In the morning, the wing will brief the program requirements, including the draft acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and the SE&amp;I contractor's required interactions within the program. In the afternoon, we will make ourselves available for brief one-on-one discussions with potential interested prime contractors in order to listen to your suggestions. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 30 minutes. The intent of the sessions is for the Government to listen to suggestions regarding the RFP or qualifying criteria for the source selection. Any information provided by the Government will be only information that is equally available to all interested parties. <br />The purpose of this event is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback and suggestions regarding the Government's forthcoming acquisition documents for the SBIRS SE&amp;I effort. The contemplated schedule includes a first draft RFP is in June 2009, a final RFP in August 2009, source selection in September, and contract award in November. <br />Please send the names of no more than 5 representatives from any prospective prime contractor to colleen.trickey@losangeles.af.mil in an email that contains no other questions or information and is labeled "Industry Day attendees - Your company name." Please include the name, SSAN, DOB, POB, Citizenship of each attendee. All meetings will be held at the unclassified level. You will get a confirmation of the time the meetings begin on May 29 after that. <br />PROGRAM INFORMATION: SBIRS has an incumbent Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) contractor that assists with a diverse range of activities that includes both A&amp;AS and system integration work. The incumbent's contract ends in December 2009. This RFI inquiry pertains to the follow-on to this effort which will primarily be for SE&amp;I work. A cost reimbursable contract is contemplated. Work under the follow-on contract will commence in January 2010 and continue for approximately 5 years.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is for market research purposes only. Respondents should note that the government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by respondent's regarding any responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: SE&amp;I and A&amp;AS tasks are shared by the Government Program Office, FFRDCs, the SE&amp;I Contractor, and the Segment Contractors. SE&amp;I tasks includes leading the coordination, guidance and execution of end-to-end systems engineering and integration activities at the systems level across all inter-Segment and external interfaces for requirements development, system testing, interface verification, system deployment, operations, and sustainment. It also includes oversight and insight of systems engineering and integration within system Segments as required to ensure system performance is met. It is expected that the SE&amp;I contractor must be capable of working intimately with all programs in the wing, and have expertise in the ground and space segments of those programs. However, the SE&amp;I contractor must also have the capability to act independently and objectively for the benefit of maintaining SBIRS programs on target with cost, schedule and performance objectives. There are three work locations that will need to be staffed- Sunnyvale, CA, Boulder, CO, and El Segundo, CA. The Program estimates that between 70 and 120 people are needed to provide services in all three locations. The Program also estimates that approx 50 percent of contractor staff will require a TS/SCI security clearance.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: To help develop an appropriate acquisition strategy and a clear and effective RFP for the SE&amp;I Follow-on contract, the SBIRS Program Office is soliciting industry inputs on the following topics: <br />1) System engineering/integration acquisition initiatives or creative, inventive solutions to reduce risk presented by the SBIRS missions; <br />2) Lessons learned and best practices; <br />3) suggestions for the eventual proposal documents, including the Statement of Objectives, contract type and incentive/award fee plan, contract deliverables, and Work Breakdown Structure, and Statement of Work instructions, and<br />4) Organizational Conflict of Interest issues, <br />5) Sections L and M suggestions. <br />Contractors must document and submit all input in writing, including recommended discussion questions by 0800 PDT 22 May 2009. Discussion questions will be addressed on Industry Day. All input shall be submitted to SMC/ISSW/PK (SBIRS), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, and Attn: Elizabeth Chirdon, Contracting Officer.</p>

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
(1) Contract financing payment and invoice payment have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(2) Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.
(3) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.
(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when--
(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;
(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;
(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor. In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer's determination with each request for payment; or
(4) DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).
(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.
(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payments requests.
(End of clause)<BR><BR>52.232-18     AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)
Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

During installation, the Offeror will be required to coordinate and cooperate with institution staff to maintain the security of the institution perimeter, including preparation and approval of security/security background checks in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 and local institution requirements for entry to the respective active USP. The Non-Lethal/Lethal Electrified Fence system consists of approximately 5500' of high voltage fence structure which is divided into zones; Concrete grade beams and sidewalks which flank the system; underground high voltage feed and return conductors, several per zone; Energizer cabinets and enclosures; Underground pull boxes; Buried rigid conduit; Computerized head end equipment; Safety interlocks and grounding system; Surge protection and riser connections. The lead-out cable is comprised of a 14 AWG steel core encased in a low density poly ethylene inner jacket coupled with a high density poly ethylene outer jacket. Due to a faulty extrusion process, the inner jacket is cracking and deteriorating, thus burning holes in the outer jacket which in turn grounds the system out.</p>

The anticipated performance period of this contract is to have first delivery by July 30, 2009, after the initial notices to proceed is issued. The performance period of each installation is 30 calendar days, with coordinated staggered notice to proceed. The estimated magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238210.

While there are other sources for domestic oil field information, there is no single source for international field level data of this variety which is comparable to the Pathfinder service. This requirement is composed of a basic package of licenses and support which will form the initial award, with further optional items and periods to b e awarded subsequently based on funding availability.   
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1],  and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  Market research has revealed no other service with as detailed or thorough data on historic and expected future costs, taxes, investment returns, or stream specific future production for fields and production projects outside the United States.  The only known competitor for international field level data, I.H.S. Energy, was contacted and their products researched.  The research revealed that this competitor did not offer as complete or up-to-date international field level data on production or costs as contained in Wood Mackenzie?s Pathfinder and did not offer any field level projections of this variety such as those contained in Pathfinder.  Due to both the scope (the world excluding the United States) and the d etail imbedded in EIA modeling of long term international liquids production, it is necessary for the supporting data to be as detailed and complete as possible.
This is a notice of intent and no solicitation is available for this requirement.
Interested parties may submit capability statement and rationale by June 15, 2009 via e-mail to monica.serrano@hq.doe.gov.  The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.

***NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii)	Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –
(A)	Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or  
(B)  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C.2304(d)(1)(B) or U.S.C.253(d)(1)(B).
***** Sole source determination is based on the need for the Laboratory Parts to be compatible with an existing outdoor sealant tester.  National Instruments is the only known vendor capable of providing the required Parts.
 ***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>This acquisition is being funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to post a solicitation consisting of a base period of six months, an option period one of six months and an option period two of one year for a Contractor to support NIST in fulfilling its responsibility to coordinate the development and harmonization of standards to enable widespread deployment of an interoperable and secure Smart Grid (SG).  As part of this requirement, the Contractor will be required to engage all relevant SG stakeholders to ensure credible results.  

Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, NIST has “primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems…” The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided additional funding through the Department of Energy to implement Section 1305 of EISA.  NIST intends to use a portion of these funds to accelerate the development of the interoperability framework and model standards.  This acquisition represents a portion of that effort.

Based on the results of recent, extensive market research, NIST AMD intends to conduct this acquisition on an unrestricted full and open competition basis under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by negotiation.  The Government intends to utilize the time-and-materials contract for the base period and both option periods.

Potential Offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.  It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation; the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to joseph.widdup@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.

Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this acquisition.

All offerors that are not small businesses under the NAICS code specified in this notice will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their proposal that meets the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, with their proposal.

The Government also intends to conduct a preproposal conference for this acquisition.  Details about that preproposal conference, as well as details about the requirements to be performed, will be included in the solicitation.

NIST anticipates posting the solicitation fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this notice (or as soon as possible thereafter).

NIST estimates that this acquisition will be valued between $5 million and $9 million, including both option periods.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting proposals for the development of high technology components and applied research for solid rocket motor components and systems of components. The program seeks to develop and demonstrate new and innovative technology for solid rocket motors in order to expand the operating envelope of current Counter Air Defense (CAD) platforms. It is the intent of this program to expand the current state-of-the-art of solid rocket motor technology using  the AGM-88 High-speed Antiradiation Missile (HARM) System as the baseline. It is anticipated that a total of $7.5M will be available for this program over a five year period, subject to appropriation and approval by ONR.
This program seeks to develop innovative, efficient, and cutting-edge technology for use in solid rocket motors used in the baseline system, to improve current system. The full-scale demonstrations for this effort will be heavyweight static tests, flightweight static tests and Insensitive Munitions (IM) tests, and flightweight ground-launched flight tests. The technology developed should be well characterized and suitable for a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 by the completion of this effort. TRL of 6 for this program is defined as a flight demonstration of a prototype rocket motor with the developed technologies integrated into the prototype motor. The flight demonstration will be ground launched, and it is the intent of the government to provide the mechanical integration requirements prior to the invitation of development teams to submit full proposals.
A Pre-Proposal Industry Day will occur on 23 July 2009. The location will be at NAWCWD in Conference Room B/C of Michelson Laboratory at China Lake, CA. The purpose of the Industry Day is twofold: 1. To further disseminate the government team's interests in regard to this program. 2. To provide a forum for potential partnering arrangements for interested parties. It is anticipated that the day will start with a government team presentation to all parties followed by a public question and answer session. If you plan on attending the meeting, you will need to follow the requirements found in Section 8 of the enclosed attachment.  A listing of the questions and answers discussed  by the government team during the public sessions of the Industry Day meeting will be posted as an amendment to this BAA synopsis. Please notify the POC listed in Section 9.0 of intent to attend so that proper security arrangements may be arranged. 
The rocket motor components shall be defined as all the components and sub-systems necessary to operate the motor, except for electrical power used to initiate the igniter. Individual technologies should address such areas as nozzles and nozzle materials, insulation materials, increased energy propellants, high volumetrically loaded grain designs, hazard classification mitigation, ground-launched flight test (hardware and software), and composite cases including attachment points. Materials characterization, manufacturing techniques, and mandrel design may be included in the program to the extent that they apply to the platform intended.
Efforts for this program should focus on the development of component hardware to expand the current state-of-the-art of rocket motor technology, however, the government is also interested in analytical techniques and modeling methods that expand the current envelope of existing analytical methods to predict rocket motor performance.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 6640,has been tasked by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to provide technical and engineering services in support of the Aluminum Vulnerability Program.To meet this requirement NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), Santa Barbara CA 93106.UCSB possess a unique combination of both the necessary laboratory capabilities as well as expert research personnel to perform the tests involved with the characterization of aluminum welds.The equipment required to complete this task includes: Tensile load frame(s) capable of high strain rate tensile tests along with contact and laser extensometers, or other equivalent system such as video extensometers. High-resolution Digital Image Correlation (DIC) equipment including high-speed cameras and relevant software, configured for tensile testing measurements; Scanning electron microscope (SEM) or equivalent for microstructural characterization; Micro-hardness measurement equipment; Machine shop capabilities for high-tolerance custom specimen manufacture; and access to LS-DYNA and/or ABAQUS for finite element calculations.UCSB's Materials Department contain the unique expertise to use high-resolution Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for high strain-rate tensile testing measurements. This measurement technique, which is novel in nature, provides data unattainable in any other way regarding material failure processes. Due to the complicated nature of the tests to be performed, the researchers performing the tasks must be experts in the field of mechanical testing and performance of materials.The research groups of Professor Frank Zok and Professor Anthony G. Evans are ideally suited to the requirements due to both professors' internationally acclaimed materials science, mechanical testing, and performance of materials. This expertise is vital to the ability to complete the tests in the Statement of Work and properly interpret the data so that the aluminum welds of interest may be characterized. Both Professors Zok and Evans provide the comprehensive mechanics and metallurgical knowledge required for determining the properties of aluminum welds using the novel technique of DIC for high-strain rate tensile testing.Prof. Frank Zok is the Associate Chair of the UCSB Materials Department. Through numerous highly regarded papers and conference presentations, he has researched the design, fabrication and performance of materials and structures. His research emphasis is placed on fundamental understanding of performance-limiting mechanisms, through combined experimental, modeling and simulation studies. He has extensive experience with novel experimental techniques and has over a decade of experience performing high strain-rate testing. Some recent research topics he has explored have been fiber-reinforced ceramic composites for gas turbine engines, novel structural concepts for protection against high intensity blast and ballistic threats, advanced cooling concepts for hypersonic space vehicles, and nanomechanics of biological materials.Prof. Anthony G. Evans is Alcoa Professor of Materials, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of the Center for Multifunctional Materials and Structures at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Prof. Evans is considered a pioneer in materials characterization. He has authored of over 540 publications, and has been honored with numerous awards and is one of the most highly cited authors in Materials Science, as well as in Engineering and Physics. Prof. Evans has been vice president of the American Ceramic Society (1984-1988) and for four years, served as chair of the Defense Sciences Research Council.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals however all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Battelle PNNL to complete a critically needed code debugging/enhancement step that will complete work initially started underContract # EP-C-04-027.
Due to the nature of software debugging work envisioned here, the learning curve necessary to understand and evaluate the FRAMES 1.x/2.x code systems in order to complete tasking is prohibitive to meeting project goals.  The estimated sum of resources needed to complete the level of effort would be expended by a new, unfamiliar contractor just to bring their group up to speed with this extremely large, complex, integrated software system.  It is estimated the learning curve time needed to understand associated problems with actual software bugs and enhancements would be in the range of 250 to 500 hours of work, which is outside the current resources available to complete the work plan.  It is, thus, unlikely any substantive progress could be made by an alternative contractor on actual software debugging and enhancement work needed.  Based on this information, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this purchase order to the original contractor in order for them to complete this critically needed code debugging/enhancement step and bring the original envisioned effort to completion.
Background
	The Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES) - Multimedia, Multipathway, Multireceptor Risk Analysis (3MRA) software system is an integrated multimedia modeling system for assessing exposure and risks from the release of hazardous materials placed into a variety of land-based waste management units.  The FRAMES 3MRA Version 1.0 (FRAMES 3MRA 1.0) software system was constructed to perform risk analyses for the USEPA Office of Solid Waste to help establish constituent-specific "exit" (e.g., safe disposal) levels for low risk solid wastes.  In the design of FRAMES 3MRA, the component-based approach provides for 1) standardized tools and techniques that are typically used in the assessment process, and 2) capabilities for new functionality to be added.
	The FRAMES 3MRA 1.0 was originally designed to run on a single PC computer system.  It was found that parallel execution across a number of machines would be valuable, helping to expedite simulation experiments needed for large, national-scale studies and various uncertainty and sensitivity analysis studies.  The FRAMES 3MRA 1.x version of the software was designed and built to allow for, among other capabilities, parallel execution of the FRAMES 3MRA 1.0 modeling system across multiple machines.  FRAMES 3MRA Version 2.0 software components, covered under this scope as well, represents a further, significantly enhanced software technology that replaces the system user interface with a more generic user interface concept. 
	To successfully control and implement the FRAMES 3MRA 1.x system so multiple (e.g., millions) runs can be simultaneously executed and tracked on the 400+ machines, a number of software tools have and are being developed to help manage the operation of the system, as well track files, warnings, and errors.Tasks:
The following tasks list the specific work required.
Task 1: Project Management
	The objective of this task is to provide for timely reporting from the contractor regarding progress of project tasking.
Deliverables and Schedule:
1. Monthly reports: The contractor shall provide monthly reports describing technical progress and related resource status.
Due date: The contractor shall provide a monthly report on or before the 10th of each month during execution of the assigned work. 
Task 2: Maintenance and Enhancement of SuperMUSE 1.0 and 3MRA 1.X Software
The objective of this task is to provide software maintenance and enhancement support for the SuperMUSE 1.0 and FRAMES 3MRA 1.X/2.X software systems.  
General Tasking to be Performed 
Software maintenance tasking to be performed by the contractor will include:
"	Telephone or email communications with the Technical Project Officer or Project Officer."	Troubleshooting and resolution of bugs identified by EPA, and those bugs that arise out of testing and evaluation performed by the contractor, "	Development and/or revision of spreadsheet-based test plans, and "	Execution of test plans.  
Software enhancement tasking to be performed by the contractor will include:
"	Telephone or email communications with the Technical Project Officer or Project Officer."	Modification of existing software to address new requirements specified by EPA, "	Troubleshooting and resolution of bugs identified by EPA during subsequent testing, and those bugs that arise out of testing and evaluation performed by the contractor, "	Development and/or revision of spreadsheet-based test plans, and "	Execution of test plans.  
Software documentation and test plans, currently located on USDA's COLAB Development Environment (https://colab.sc.egov.usda.gov/cb/workspace.do; 3MRA FRAMES V2 Project Area) will be the basis for evaluation of existing software requirements and functionality.   Additional software requirements associated with component enhancements will be specified by EPA through Technical Directives associated with this statement of work.  
Development, modification and/or enhancement of existing documentation (i.e., the formal documents which include sections on descriptions, requirements, design, and specifications) will be the responsibility of EPA.  
In addition to revision, execution, and documentation of test plans, the contractor will also be responsible for providing brief summary descriptions (using notation and/or file management features of COLAB) on changes to design and specifications sections as may be needed to maintain and/or enhance software (e.g., brief statements indicating information that may need addition/modification, dictionary and/or database table structure definitions that may need addition/modification, etc).
	Specific Technical Directives			The Agency will provide a written description of each bug resolution request for work to be completed on specific software components, and the required schedule.  These requests will be referred to as Technical Directives and will generally indicate: a) the software component(s) to be tested, de-bugged and/or enhanced, b) initial formulations of any new or modified software requirements, and c) a not-to-exceed number of hours of Senior Software Engineer (e.g., software development) time and Software Engineer (i.e. software testing) time that may be expended by the contractor on the given request.  EPA will be responsible for posting an initial set of bugs to COLAB.   New requirements desired by the Agency will each be posted to COLAB as a bug, with an indicator that the bug is associated with a new requirement.		It is anticipated that several components may be associated with a given request, where work on individual components may or may not be directly related.  It is also anticipated that more than one technical directive may need to be active at a given time to address new issues that may arise in bringing closure to an existing request.		Because a given bug cannot always be immediately associated with a given component, it is anticipated some components will be specified in the request that ultimately do not need modification.		While fulfilling a given Technical Directive, in the event an additional component(s) is identified by the contractor as needing enhancement or modification to achieve the original request, the contractor shall: a) post associated bugs on COLAB; and b) notify the Technical Project Officer.  As determined by the Technical Project Officer,  a new or modified request will be issued to handle associated software enhancements or modifications of the newly identified component. 	The contractor may evaluate any existing SuperMUSE 1.0 and 3MRA 1.X/2.X software codes for any component at anytime as needed to execute a given request (including execution of informal software testing by the developer), but shall not post enhanced or modified codes to COLAB, or conduct formal testing of any component, unless that component has been identified in a specific request.  		Contractor Response to Specific Technical Directives		Prior to initiation of actual bug resolution or enhancement through software development efforts, the contractor will first:"	Review the request, "	As needed review associated codes for components specified in the request, and "	Consult the Technical Project Officer via telephone to discuss technical content of the request (e.g., to review and modify if necessary newly stated requirements, to discuss current software behaviors needing resolution, and to discuss initial technical approach to be taken to achieve software enhancement or modification).  	For each request the contractor shall then execute the required enhancement/modification/testing, and deliver the resulting source code, software, test plans, and summary notations on design and specifications to the Agency via the COLAB development environment.   		During execution of the project, the contractor shall:"	Attempt to hold phone discussions with the Technical Project Officer approximately biweekly to discuss technical progress on all active requests.  "	Notify the EPA Technical Project Officer and Project Officer via direct email or other automated COLAB email-based communication when a successfully executed test plan (less Agency approval) for a given component has been posted to COLAB.   		In closing out a given request, the contractor shall provide a Summary Technical Progress Report in email form to the Technical Project Officer and the Project Officer if one or more components were not completed due technical difficulties.  In this case, the contractor shall briefly summarize (e.g., in simple table format) which deliverables were not completed for each component.  		Processing and Documentation of Software Bugs		For each component, until successfully executed test plan (with Agency approval) status has been reached, it is anticipated that the Agency and the contractor may post new bugs that are identified during review and testing associated with a given request.   All detailed notations on specific bugs to be resolved and bug resolution will be conducted via COLAB by both EPA and the contractor.  Any new bug identified by the contractor during execution of this WA, which substantially changes existing specifications and design shall be posted to COLAB and appropriate notations provided (i.e., the Agency requires that all substantial changes made to the software are documented through COLAB bugs and COLAB notations for component design and specifications).  Any bug identified but not resolved by the contractor during execution of this WA, which substantially affects attainment of the component's stated software requirements, shall also be posted to COLAB (i.e., the Agency requires that all known remaining software deficiencies identified by the contractor during testing be documented in COLAB).  Minor bugs that are resolved during evaluation, modification, enhancement or testing that do no substantially affect existing design and specifications documentation need not to be notated in COLAB.		Total Tasking Level of Effort			For purposes of estimating resources for this task the contractor shall assume an overall level of effort of approximately 268 hours total of software development, software testing, and project management which will be split across the two tasks and associated Technical Directives. 		Deliverables and Schedule:		Specific SuperMUSE 1.0 and 3MRA 1.X/2.X Software components to be worked on by the contractor, and associated schedule, will be determined during execution of the project.  In evaluating content and acceptance criteria for deliverables, the following will generally apply:
C	Successfully executed test plan status (less Agency approval) for a given software component requires that: 1.	Specific requirements related to the functionality of the software must be documented (as provided by the Technical Project Officer within the Technical Directives); 2.	All identified software bugs have been resolved by the contractor or reconciled as future work to be completed by the Agency (e.g., some bugs may not be able to be resolved at this time within current resources); 3.	Summary notations on modifications and additions to design and specifications sections of formal documentation have been posted to COLAB by the contractor; 
4.	Executed and notated test plans have been posted to COLAB by the contractor which satisfy all component requirements; and 5.	Source code and compiled software codes have been posted to COLAB.
C	Successfully executed test plan status (with Agency approval) for a given software component requires that: 
1.	Successfully executed test plan status (less Agency approval) has been attained by the contractor for the given software component; 
2.	The Agency has reviewed and approved the executed test plan (via email notification to the contactor).
Completion Status for a Specific Technical Directive
A specific Technical Directive will be deemed completed and no additional efforts should be expended by the contractor on the given request when either: 
1.	   Currently approved hours associated with a given Technical Directive have been expended by the contractor and the contractor has provided a Summary Technical Progress Report for all components not completed, 

a. Based upon the Technical Project Officer assessment of degree of completion, the Technical Project Officer may reauthorize the existing technical directive by adding additional hours to further complete the specific request. Alternatively, the Technical Project Officer may also either choose to not expend additional effort, or otherwise roll some part or all of remaining tasking still to be completed into a new technical directive.  
b. In the event that the existing technical directive is re-authorized, the Technical Project Officer will notify the contractor and EPA's Project Officer by re-issuing and notating the original technical directive, indicating both the previous authorized level already expended. 					or 
2.	   Successfully executed test plan status (with Agency approval) has been attained for all components identified in the request.		Special Conditions	1.	All requests related to execution of the technical support described within this SOW shall be coordinated through the EPA Technical Project Officer. 2.	The contractor shall not respond to requests or inquiries made by others individuals except where made by the technical project officer approved by the contractor officer.3.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that a Summary Technical Progress Report for all components can be completed for a given request and delivered to the Technical Project Officer or the Project Officer.

Management Controls 
The following management controls are adequate to ensure that Agency officials remain accountable and retain control over the contractor's product.  In summary, this contract will utilize these management controls to assure that the proposed contractor services will not place EPA in a vulnerable position and will ensure that Government policy is not being created by or unduly influenced by contractors, and that contractor employees will not be assumed to be EPA employees. The project officer is responsible for assuring compliance.
1.	All work will be off-site.  The contractor will take care to ensure that it has no conflict of interest in the performance of this work.  The contractor is responsible for identifying any known or apparent conflict of interest and reporting it to the Technical Project Officer for resolution.	2.	The Technical Project Officer will monitor the deliverable schedule and review the deliverables to ensure that the content and quality are responsive to the requirements of the SOW.  Under this fixed price vehicle, the Technical Project Officer may not provide technical directions to the Contractor which would have the effect of adding or deleting items required under the contract, changing the deliverable schedule or deleting or substantially changing the content of a deliverable.  Any problems with deliverables or the contract schedule will be addressed to the Contractor only through the Contracting Officer.  Technical communication between the technical project officer and contractor for the purpose of clarification or preliminary advisement of issues or problems is permissible as is adjustment of the deliverable schedule to accommodate possible delays on the side of EPA.
3.	The Contractor will submit all drafts and final deliverables to the Technical Project Officer.  These documents will be secured per records control management protocols.	4.	The contractor shall clearly identify itself as an EPA contractor when acting in fulfillment of this contract.  No decision-making activities relating to Agency policy, enforcement or future contracting will take place if the contractor is present.  If the contractor has a need to meet with Federal employees onsite, then the Contractor personnel shall visibly wear identification in performance of this contract while on-site which will be issued by the Government upon arrival to the Federal facility.	5.	EPA shall be mentioned as the funding source, with appropriate and standard EPA disclaimers, for all subsequent articles and publications that arise as a result of the work products of this contract, its result and products, and subsequent work stemming from these products after the contract is completed.

As stated above, EPA intends to award this procurement on a sole source basis.  Ne

<a href="mailto:heath.brad@epa.gov">BRAD A. HEATH</a>
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to acquire a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer for the Agency?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL)  in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines. The NVFEL  has the responsibility for testing vehicles and engines to ensure compliance with regulations.  The fuels used for that testing also are analyzed at NVFEL to ensure compliance with the specifications called out in the regulations.  These fuels are used to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles and engines.
In its role as a National Laboratory for the measurement of regulated emissions, and fuel quality, NVFEL plays a critical role in those measurements.  To support that role, EPA seeks to purchase an FTIR Spectrometer to perform analyses of finished fuels and commercial blendstocks of biodiesel by ASTM method D7371, and to develop other methods such as for water in fuel grade ethanol.  For the equipment specified, the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, including design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, and documentation and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.
NAICS code 334516 applies to this acquisition, which is subject to full and open competition.  Award will be made on a best value basis.  Evaluation of proposals will include assessment of: technical capability to meet or exceed the Statement of Work requirements; past performance under similar projects; ability to meet or exceed the required delivery schedule; and price.  For purposes of evaluating proposals, all evaluation criteria other than price, when combined, are significantly more importance than price.  The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Brad Heath, Contract Specialist, at 513-487-2352 or heath.brad@epa.gov.  A copy of the solicitation will be made available on FedBizOpps on or about June 18, 2009.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided. Telephone requests will not be honored. All responsible concerns may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788

<a href="mailto:pwilson@aatd.eustis.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a non-commercial program entitled, Helicopter Vulnerability Reduction.  The Army has a unique opportunity and a requirement to assess and explore the specific test events observed during the recent full-scale UH-60M upgrade composite tail cone ballistic testing.  The intent of the proposed acquisition is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of ballistic performance test events for the full-scale UH-60M upgrade composite tail cone versus predicted results determined under a previously completed demonstration of Survivable, Affordable, and Reparable Airframe Program Virtual Prototype and Validation (SARAP V&V) program.  The comprehensive assessment utilizing refined modeling/simulation and analytical tools/techniques will result in a more accurate prediction of ballistic performance and post-impact residual load capability of the UH-60M composite tail cone.  This effort will allow specific recommendations to be made early in the redesign and test phase of composite tail cone production prior to the full-scale testing under the UH-60M upgrade program to reduce its vulnerability to the ballistic threats.  The proposed acquisition builds upon previously completed and currently on-going research and development by United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) as well as the independent research and development by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) in support of the Army UH-60M composite tail cone program.  Both of these sources are business entities having a common parent, United Technologies Corporation (UTC).  However, SAC will not be solicited as the records show that in previous efforts involving modeling and simulation of UH-60M composite tail cone, UTRC has been the lead entity within UTC.  AATD is also aware that SAC has already initiated a preliminary review of the full-scale UH-60M composite tail cone performance with an interdivisional transfer to UTRC.  This preliminary review and preceding efforts will be the springboard for the comprehensive analysis sought under this acquisition.  AATD anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract on a sole source basis to United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), who is deemed to be the only responsible source fully capable of meeting this requirement for UH-60M upgrade composite tail cone program.  Market research revealed that no other source has the previous experience with the particular underlying baseline modeling that fell short of the anticipated performance for the full-scale composite tail cone for the UH-60M upgrade or the detail material and construction design, fabrication process, and test data/specific test details necessary to refine ballistic modeling/simulation and analytical tools/techniques for performing a comprehensive analysis for the ballistic performance of the UH-60M composite tail cone.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and UTRC, consistent with Alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Performance under this acquisition will require access to and generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec.2751 et.seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App 2401 et. seq.  An Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with Dod Directive 5230.25 will be required for this acquisition.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN:  DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.  Performance under this acquisition is expected to require access to and generation of technical data classified at the Secret level.  A facility clearance and storage capability are required, and the personnel are required to perform at the Secret level.  The overall period of performance is eighteen (18) months.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement,  proposal, or quotation that shall be considered.  Written proposal shall be submitted to no later than July 20, 2009 at 12:00pm  EST and should be addressed to AATD, Attn: RDMR-AAC (Ms. Paulette L. Wilson), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, 23604-5577.  Ms. Wilsons phone number is 757-878-2788.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address, FAX 757-878-0008 or Email: paulette.wilson@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Amendment to Sources Sought 09-006SS
Sources Sought notice amended to include the following statements:Contract magnitude is expected to be more than $10,000,000.00.Quantity of dredging at this time is estimated to be approximately 1,500,000 cubic yards or more.
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (Dredging).    The small business size standard for NAICS Code 237990 is $20 million. 
The purpose of the proposed project is for a Contractor to furnish all of the labor, dredge, support equipment, materials, and incidentals necessary for the performance of maintenance dredging along the overflow weir from the headworks of the All American Canal and north along the Colorado River channel for a distance of approximately 3,000 feet, approximately 2,100 feet along the face of the dam and weir, and approximately 1,200 feet north up the secondary river channel above the Gila Sluiceway adjacent to Hidden Shores (formerly Imperial Oasis) on the Arizona side of the river channel.     
In addition to affecting the ability to store sluicing flows, sediment deposition above Imperial Dam has resulted in nuisance vegetation growth near hydraulic features, which compromise the operational function of the reservoir and the structural integrity of the Dam, including features of historical value. 
Depending upon the availability of funding, Reclamation will also require the maintenance dredging of the Laguna Settling Basin.  The Laguna Basin dredging will be an executable option to the Imperial Dredging requirement.
It should be noted, the dredge and associated equipment are required to operate over a large temperature variation.  Ambient air temperatures can range from the lower 30's during the winter months to highs of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months (June through September).
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin November 6, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of November 1, 2010. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Wendy Williams at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than 10 June, 2009.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Wendy Williams/LC-3113, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail wwilliams@usbr.gov.

The aircraft was based on the Boeing 707-321 commercial airliner platform. The primary purpose of the E-6 is to operate as an airborne command and communications center, relaying instructions from the National Command Authority. 

There are currently sixteen (16) E-6 aircraft in service.  These aircraft operate out of the same main operating base (Tinker Air Force Base) and forward operating bases (Travis Air Force and Offutt Air Force Base) as the Air Force KC-135.  The Air Force logistics network for the KC-135 is fairly extensive so it is in the Navy’s best interest to access this network for support of the E-6.  Therefore, a collateral objective in upgrading from steel to carbon brakes is to maximize compatibility and interchangeability between the KC-135 and E-6 brake, wheel, and tire assemblies.

Objective:

The Contractor shall execute the tasks herein in support of the U.S. Navy E-6 implementation, evaluation, and testing of the carbon brakes, wheels, and tires.  The Contractor shall provide management oversight for each subtask at a level consistent with technical risk.

The Contractor shall furnish and install carbon brakes, wheels, and tires, along with all required hardware, on one Government-furnished E-6 aircraft.  The E-6 carbon brakes, tires, and wheels, and associated hardware shall be compatible, to the maximum extent possible, with KC-135 brakes, wheels, tires, and associated hardware. The Contractor shall integrate KC-135 brake, wheel, and tire components into the E-6 aircraft with the least amount of rework/reconfiguration required.  For this effort, the Government will furnish KC-135 carbon brakes for incorporation into the E-6 brake, wheel and tire assemblies.  An optimal end state would be to able to draw from KC-135 brake, wheel, and tire spare parts inventories for direct E-6 use.

Phase 1 – Assessment (4-6 months)
-	System level specification
-	Preliminary architecture for the brake control system
-	Preliminary weight impact of the wheel and brake upgrade
-	Preliminary Bill of Material for the wheel and brake upgrade
-	Stop performance predictions based on contractor analysis
-	Trade studies of options (i.e. - radial tire and other reliability improvements for the landing system)
-	Preliminary Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) of    the Wheel and Brake Upgrade
-	Preliminary Design Review
-	Description of all airplane and wheel/brake modifications required
-	Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
-	Identification of any and all needed support equipment (SE)

Phase 2 – Implementation (9-11 months)
-	Component level specifications
-	Drawings (in AutoCAD-compatible format)
-	Weight Report
-	Bill of Materials
-	Compliance matrix with system level requirements
-	Qualification plan
-	FMECA
-	System Safety Evaluation (SSE)
-	Performance Analysis Report, including preliminary wear-rate analysis
-	Flight test instrumentation plan
-	Flight test plan
-	Flight test report
-	Anti-skid system evaluation
-	Technical Order changes
-	Aircraft Flight Manual changes (assumed equivalent performance)
-	Hardware in the Loop simulation report
-	Flight test hardware (brakes furnished by the Government), contractor shall manage procurement of brake control components
-	Development of one installation kit
-	Critical Design Review
-	Flight Readiness Review

Phase 3 – Acquisition (6 months)
-	Acquire wheels that will be compatible with the E-6 carbon brakes (to maximize the compatibility between the KC-135 and the E-6) 1.) and with both radial and bias construction tires.
-	Acquire 46”X17” or 49”X17” radial tires compatible with the E-6 carbon brakes and wheels (depending on outcome of phase one tire engineering study)
-	Develop carbon brake, wheel and tire kits for each aircraft (again to maximize compatibility between the KC-135 and E-6)
-	Deliver retrofit kits to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, OK (or other designated site)
-	Provide follow-on support performing revisions to technical publications and responding to technical questions.

The Contractor shall perform the effort required under this program using FAA commercial regulations, testing, practices, and procedures, and direction contained within this SOW. Brake components common with Air Force KC-135 will be provided as GFE to the Contractor.

General Performance Requirements:  Detailed Performance Requirements will be provided with the RFQ

Period of Performance:

Date of Award (DOA) or 08/01/2009 – 01/01/2010, with two (2) one-year options.

<DESC>Introduction:<BR>The Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) has been in the USMC inventory since 1983.  Since the initial fielding of the FOLAV there have been two major upgrades; the Service Life Extension Program LAV-A1 (SLEP) (1998-2002) and the LAV-A2 Survivability Upgrade (LAV A2 SU) (2006-2010).  While these upgrades extended the primary systems service life of the FOLAV through 2025, the upgrades did not address the variant specific subsystem mission suites on the LAV-ATA2.  Basic characteristics of the LAV platform are provided in Attachment 1 of this RFI.<BR><BR>The LAV-ATA2s subsystem mission suite has become difficult to support and several subcomponents are obsolete.  In fact, the M901A1 TOW has reached the point of ever increasing obsolescence limiting it to USMC inventory.  As part of additional service life extension and fleet upgrade efforts, PM-LAV is evaluating improvements to the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system. The specific purpose of this program is to improve the supportability and mission effectiveness of the LAV-ATA2 by providing the following mission suite upgrades:<BR>1.	An Anti-Tank weapon station with:<BR><BR>"	Multiple reload, and rapid capability<BR>"	Ability to facilitate multiple target engagements in high intensive fights<BR>"	An effective platform for Elevated TOW Systems (ETS), and offers the LAR Battalion a precision long-range capability to destroy the enemy<BR>"	A second generation thermal sight and an advanced fire control system capable of firing the current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles<BR>"	Improved reliability, availability, and maintainability<BR><BR>2.	Turret Trainers for the Operational Forces and float assets for each of the<BR>Maintenance Centers<BR><BR><BR>The following are specific objectives of this program:<BR><BR>"	Provide the LAV-AT mission suite upgrades initial operational capability by May 13, 2013 and full operational capability by August 3rd 2016<BR>"	Meet all threshold key performance parameters<BR>"	Improve LAV-AT  readiness by greater than 10% and reduce the operational and support cost by greater than 5%<BR><BR>The deliverables/resultant products of this effort will be 115 LAV-AT modernized with the mission suite upgrades, nine LAV-AT Turret Trainers, two turrets float assets with all mission suite upgrades applied.  In addition meet all milestones and provide supporting documentation required per SECNAV Instruction 5000.2D (unless otherwise directed by MARCORPSYSCOM ACPROG authority).<BR><BR>It is anticipated that after receipt of information from the respondents of this RFI, the government will conduct a trade study followed by a downselect process to determine several leading turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system solution candidates that will undergo additional evaluation.  The evaluation will include ergonomic assessments, spaceclaim and mounting studies, human factors studies, modeling and simulation. Turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system samples may also be acquired for physical measurement, performance evaluations, and testing.  The proposed solutions will be evaluated against current and future mission profiles and the impact of the design on life cycle cost of the LAV system.  <BR>Specific areas of evaluation for the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system trade study and downselect include these requirements (T = threshold / O = Objective):<BR>"	effectively acquire, engage, and destroy threat main battle tanks beyond the range of enemy tank main guns (T)								<BR>"	ability to destroy bunkers and concrete buildings that harbor threat (T)<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition while stationary (T)			<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition on the move (O)<BR>"	allow rapid transition from battlefield movement to target engagement (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload while under armor protection (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload from inside the vehicle (O)<BR>"	fire from a short halt (T)<BR>"	fire on the move (O)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament in a 3600 field of fire (T)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament, day or night, under obscured conditions of smoke, fog, haze and dust (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 2 ready rounds in launcher and minimum of 14 stored rounds  (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 4 ready rounds (O)<BR>"	capable of fire multiple missiles without reloading (T)<BR>"	have an automatic loader or have the capability of being retro-fit with an automatic loader (O)<BR>"	accommodate ground mounting when necessary (T)<BR>"	fire current and next generation USMC inventory heavy anti-armor missiles (T)<BR>"	provide fire and forget anti-tank weapon system capability (O)<BR>"	training commonality for current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles (O)<BR>"	LAV-AT crew consists of four Marines (T)<BR>"	Full mission capability with three personnel (O)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .75 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (T)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .9 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (O)<BR>"	achieve compatibility with the LAV-AT secondary armament (M240E1, 7.62 mm machine gun pintle, with azimuth and elevation travel locks with a minimum 1800 arc traverse and accessible through the commanders hatch) (T)<BR>"	have degraded capability to permit targets to be acquired and destroyed when the main power and /or hydraulic system of the LAV-AT have failed (O)<BR>Responses should include descriptions of sustainment characteristics such as reliability Mean Miles Between Failures (MMBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), commonality with other systems, and in theater sustainment.  Additional technical data will likely be requested from participating turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system manufacturers, including spaceclaim and interface drawings, prior test data, mass properties, and dynamic stiffness characteristics.  This information will be applied to the validated modeling and simulation environment.  Results of the evaluation will be shared with each potential supplier as may be appropriate. <BR><BR>If you are interested in participating in this LAV upgrade effort, please respond by completing the Attachment 2 questionnaire and send it to:<BR>Dan Marcantonio<BR>Procurement Analyst<BR>daniel.marcantonio@us.army.mil <BR>586-574-9062<BR><BR>Please feel free to include any additional product brochures, test results, technical data, etc. that you believe is relevant to the LAV application.<BR><BR>Thank you in advance for your help on our trade study for the LAV turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system and we look forward to continued discussion on this project. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah Regional Contracting Center (SRCC), Charleston Office has a requirement for the above subject. This is not a Solicitation Announcement and is not a Request for Proposal.  This does not obligate the Government to any contract award.<BR><BR>The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to determine interests and capabilities of potential qualified Small Business Administration (SBA), Certified 8(a), Hubzone Small Business, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 238220, Plumbing, Heating, and Air Conditioning Contractors. The Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 Million. To make an appropriate acquisition decision for the above project, the Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis. The order of magnitude for this effort is estimated between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. <BR><BR>Project Location:  Chillicothe Veterans Administration Medical Center, Chillicothe, OH<BR><BR>The VA Medical Center, Chillicothe, Ohio currently operates three (3) 30,000 pph E. Keeler water-tube boilers manufactured in 1970 that are housed in Building 259.  The boilers are operated with a steam header pressure of 110 psi.  The primary fuel utilized is natural gas at a regulated supply pressure of approximately 7 psi, with #2 oil as a back-up fuel.  The existing boilers have been reliable, but are starting to become problematic due to age and water treatment.  Existing Boiler #3 has approximately 14 ruptured tubes and is currently inoperable.  In addition, there has been an electrical failure located in the main Motor Control Center.  There is a current construction project that has been ongoing for 10 months to upgrade the controls, feed-water pumps, piping and install a reverse osmosis water treatment system.<BR><BR>The design build contractor shall replace the existing boilers with new pressurized vessel units sized to meet the steam production needs of the facility as determined by on-site investigation by the A-E, the new boilers will be housed in a new building.

Life cycle cost analysis shall be utilized.  <BR> <BR>New Boilers shall meet all current VA Design guides/alerts/standards and methods as well as all ASME and National Boiler Standards.   The burner assemblies shall have energy efficient components such as: flue gas economizer, flue gas recirculation, parallel positioning fuel and air ratio with O2 trimming, and Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) on the motor of the FD (Forced Draft) fan. <BR><BR>Because the production of steam at the Boiler Plant is the main source of building heat, steam for food preparation and hot water for the campus, it is imperative to minimize, if not eliminate, down time.   Steam production must be maintained at all times for both winter and summer demands as determined by the Design-Build Team.  <BR>Design plans shall utilize the most current building codes, VA Energy Management and VA Design guides/alerts/standards/methods.  Design shall contain drawings/schematics, potential impacts on building systems, cost estimates, timeline/phasing plans for temporary boilers, and summary write-up of the advantages/disadvantages of each planning consideration, to include potential energy net savings or additional use with the new boilers.<BR><BR>If you can meet all of the requirements for this project, please respond to this sources sought by email, or Fax to Lisa Simmons. The e-mail address for Ms. Simmons is lisa.s.simmons@usace.army.mil. The Fax number is 843-329-2327.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, on 12 Jun 2009.

<CONTACT>Cheryl A EbertContract Specialist412-954-4017

<a href="mailto:Cheryl.Ebert@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 with Vicon , 7388 S Revere Parkway, Centennial, CO 80112 to purchase and install six (6) MX-T10 Cameras - 1.0 megapixel resolution up to 250 frame/s, four (4) MX-T20 Cameras - 2.0 megapixel resolution up to 500 frame/s, one (1) Vicon MX Giganet Lab, and one (1) Vicon PECS Control.  These system components are necessary in order to interface with our current VICON Motion Capture System.  The required components will plug into the current computer which runs NEXUS for motion analysis and work in conjunction with our existing motion capture cameras and system.  The following is a list of specific specifications of VICON hardware, support and software:  Vicon MX T-series passive retro-reflective marker based motion capture cameras utilize full 256 shades of gray scale data for centroid processing with circle fitting algorithms, and 3 on-board smart processors in each camera to perform these functions for the most accurate marker center tracking available today.Vicon MX T-series cameras process full gray scale in real-time, and also capture gray scale offline with full gray scale weighting centroid processing to find marker centers.Vicon MX T-series cameras are all digital, and able to differentiate overlapping markers from each camera's view in real time and offline, with data throughput utilizing a 1Gigabit Ethernet card for streaming.Vicon MX T-20 cameras have digital CMOS sensors with 1600 x 1280 ( 2 MegaPixel) resolution capable of capturing full resolution data up to 500Hz.  Only a single cable connection from the camera is used to provide power, synchronization, and video signals.Vicon MX T-series cameras have an electronic freeze frame shutter custom designed for Motion Capture.Vicon MX T-20 camera systems can collect over 1000 markers at speeds up to 2000Hz.Vicon T-series cameras use a powerful surface-mount LED strobe that are timed perfectly with the freeze frame shutter on the camera to obtain a crystal clear image.Vicon Nexus software has a user customizable interface that includes protocol construction wizard that will allow the user to run the entire system through the protocol wizard from start to final post-processing.The Vicon Nexus Software has a new static subject labeling tool that automatically labels the subject with only on mouse click to execute the step.  No manual labeling of a trial is required to set-up a subject. Vicon Nexus software allows for batch processing across a user-selected set of processes, subjects, and trials, without the need for user interaction during post-processing.Vicon MX T-20 Cameras capture 2D images with a resolution of 1600 x 1280 up to 500 frames per second allowing markers 4 mm in diameter to be accurately located with a mean residual error < 0.25 mm within a 2 m x 2 m x 2 m data capture space.Vicon Nexus software is able to provide not only instantaneous audio bio-feedback of kinematic movements, but also instantaneous audio feedback to analog data streaming in real time.Vicon Nexus 3D acquisition software is capable of capturing reference video simultaneously from up to 6 digital cameras.  All digital Basler cameras can be connected to a single PC capable of real time preview and capture to hard disk from all the cameras without dropping frames.  The digital video capture is fully frame-synchronized using sync-pulse cables connected to the 3D marker and analog data acquisition equipment.  The digital video cameras are progressive scan, and capable of capture rates up to 200Hz.Vicon Nexus software is capable of calibrating two high speed (200Hz) digital cameras into the 3D workspace for real time visualization of 3D data and ground reaction force vector data overlaid in 2D video image.Vicon Motion Systems has at least 12 Support Personnel on staff with 18 hours of phone coverage.The Vicon Motion Capture System is certified for ISO 9000, Medical Device Directive (MDD) and CE.This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than June 8, 2009 C.O.B.  Responses should be sent to Cheryl.Ebert@va.gov.  No telephone or fax responses will be accepted.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>Request for Information--Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support (OMINS)</p>
<p>This Special Notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) to aid in market research and acquisition planning for an upcoming follow-on competitive acquisition. Information is being sought regarding potential subcontracting possibilities and recommendation of contract type (i.e. FFP, Cost) for the following requirement:</p>
<p>The contemplated contract will provide support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network Support for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) ensuring critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).</p>
<p>The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data. Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.</p>
<p>Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities. Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data from the 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85 EIS) and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) Antenna Control Units (ACUs) for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.</p>
<p>Network Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.</p>
<p>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Information received will be solely for the purpose of market research and acquisition planning. The Government is under no obligation to pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI. The North American Industrial Classification System Number (NAICS) is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $4.5M. Interested parties should respond to this RFI by 12:00 pm MDST, June 9, 2009, via email to the attention of: kathryn.dillon@schriever.af.mil.</p>

All waste water onsite shall be collected. Vacuum trucks shall maintain a service schedule to remove the wastewater from the tanks and transport offsite to dispose of at a permitted treatment facility. Use of Containerized On-Site Waste Water Systems may be used if authorized by the COTR. When available, public utilities shall be utilized.</p>
<p>SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL (DUMPSTERS)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all necessary solid waste collection and disposal for the base camp in accordance with OSHA CFR 29 1910.142 (i)(3) l, State, and Local regulations.</p>
<p>CLEANING/JANITORIAL SERVICES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide cleaning/janitorial services for all components of the base camp. All sleeping areas shall be cleaned once daily or more frequently if needed. The kitchen and dining facility shall be cleaned after each meal. Cleaning and janitorial services should be performed sufficiently to keep the base professionally clean and sanitary at all times.</p>
<p>CAMP DEMOBILIZATION</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop and present a demobilization plan to the COTR/TM and CO within 14 days of occupation of site.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall demobilize the base camp within seven days of notice, or as negotiated, by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall demobilize camp, clean the site, remove/dispose of all garbage and used materials and return the site to its original condition within seven days of the demobilization notice.</p>
<p>All associated costs for time and travel from the disaster incident after base camp demobilization must be incorporated in the overall demobilization costs.</p>
<p><br />Questions to include on the RFI</p>
<p><br />1. FEMA has in the past in most cases used tents for housing First Responders when they had to construct the camp in open spaces. Are you aware of any other options versus building a "tent city"?</p>
<p>2. FEMA needs the ability to reduce or increase the size of the camp in a short timeframe. Based on that what is the best method of cost migration? Is there a way to execute reductions or increases more cost effectively and time efficiently?</p>
<p>3. FEMA has a requirement to provide turn key housing for First Responders for a minimum of 301 and a maximum of 2000 occupants. Would you recommend phasing or modular installation?</p>
<p>4. What is the shortest period of time in which subcontracting for equipment and personnel needed to support the camp (maintenance) can be conducted?</p>
<p>5. Based on the still pending requirement that all personnel must be cleared at a minimum, fingerprinting and credit check, will this affect the time to erect a camp and turn it over for occupancy by FEMA authorized personnel? The current time is 72 hours.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisition-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) intends to negotiate and award sole source purchase order to Emory University-Yerkes National Primate Research Center, 954 Gatewood Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30329-1018 for the search for the Auditory Engram in Chimpanzees.  This project involves training chimpanzees to perform an auditory delayed matching-to-sample-task to test long-term auditory memory.  The chimps at Yerkes have had extensive behavioral training on matching-to-sample type cognitive tasks.  In particular, they have training on matching vocalizations with appropriate facial expressions.  Because of this, memory will be assessed to determine if there is any long-term memory in this type of task.  Thus, the chimps will have to remember the vocalization for several seconds before they can match to the appropriate face.  Once we complete testing on this task we will begin to test them directly on an auditory recognition memory task.  Testing will be done in the Yerkes Cognition Room, using a touchscreen set-up.  A trail begins with a sound (2s) from a single speaker.  Touching the touchscreen during the sound will not be rewarded, but will, instead, immediately trigger a second sound (2s) presented through the same speaker.  If the sound matches the sample sound touching the left spot on the touch screen during the second sound will result in a reward.  If the sound does not match sample sound then touching the spot on the right of the touch screen results in reward.  The chimps will be tested on 100 trials a day.  The sounds will be from a set of 900 “junk” sounds that includes natural sounds to synthetic sounds.  The chimps will be trained on this or a modified version until they perform about 85% correct.  To test the chimp’s auditory memory, a very short delay will be introduced at first between the sample and test sounds.  Then the delay will be gradually increased until the chimp no longer performs significantly about chance.
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the work is to be carried out at Yerkes National Primate Research Center where access to chimpanzees is available.  The team of investigators has the expertise and experience to complete the proposed work, thus it is cost efficient to continue the ongoing collaboration.  
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.
Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1078223 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.

<DESC><p>NAICS Code 238220 - Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors. Size Standard $14 million.
<p>The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Services, Boston Service Center, Boston, Massachusetts intends to issue a sole source contract modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend Contract No. GS-01P-03-BWC-0139 for a 3-month performance period from July 1, 2009, through September 30, 2009. The current contract provides Mechanical Operations and Maintenance Services (O&amp;M) for the John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Boston, MA and will expire on June 30, 2009. Proposals have been received for the follow on contract under solicitation number GS-01P-09-BW-D-0009 and are in the evaluation process. In order to ensure that the optimum time is given at each step in the process, additional time is needed to complete the remaining steps while ensuring the integrity of the process and fairness to all offerors. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award.</p>
<p>Description of the work to be performed: The contractor is to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, material, supplies and equipment (except otherwise provided), and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services described in the contract. The contractor shall be fully responsible for providing all customer service mechanical operations and maintenance, incidentally repairs, minor repairs, quality control and all other services listed in the contract as necessary to perform O&amp;M for a three (3) month extension for the John F. Kennedy Federal Building.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This extension would be issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to federal agencies in the New England region. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances. Brooks Range Contract Services has been performing these services since 2004 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 3-month performance period.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame, it may give notification and provide a written capability statement via e-mail to Shirley McCarthy, Contract Specialist at shirley.mccarthy@gsa.gov no later than June 12, 2009, 10:00 a.m., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.</p>

<CONTACT>Jonathan Gardner, Phone 505-284-3557, Email jgardn@sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia Corporation is pleased to announce the development of Stingray, a Fluid Blade Disablement Tool (FBD) for, e.g., national security and law enforcement applications.  An explosive charge is used to propel a portion of the Stingray casing and a liquid towards a barrier, causing a puncture in the barrier and allowing the liquid to proceed to the other side.  The Stingray design allows it to be placed almost in contact with the target without losing its effectiveness; it can also impact a target from a distance.  These characteristics hold the possibility that Stingray can be used for various useful applications, such as bomb disablement.  Sandia desires a partner to commercialize this technology.  Partners may obtain a pre-negotiated nonexclusive license for reasonable compensation.  Partners may also obtain a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADAs) or Non Federal Entity (NFE) agreement, both of which are expected to include funds-in to Sandia.  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

The purpose of this modification is to increase the level of effort of this Task Order in order to accommodate unforseen developmental requirements that fall within the scope of the current effort.  This effort can not be competed because, due to its developmental nature, the Government would realize substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays if another vendor would be brought in at this phase of development.  All questions and or comments in response to this synopsis shall be submitted in writing and emailed to david.hackett1@us.army.mil.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor the Army Single Face to Industry website on a regular basis for any updates.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source contract for services of a survey methodologist (40 hours per week), to Boston University School of Public Health.  A fixed price contract with a base of June 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009 was awarded.  It is the Governments belief that only Booston University possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: The agency is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The activity is the Boston VA Medical Center.2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to BU School of Public Health.3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).The Center for Organization, Leadership and Management Research (COLMR), an HSR&D Center of Excellence at the VA Boston Healthcare System,  requires expert survey methodology services for various VA funded research projects being conducted at COLMR.The estimated value of this service is $45,767.50.4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirments.  This procurement is under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Law Title 38 USC sections 8151-8153.5.  Demonstration of the contractors unique qualifications:Because of the high level of specialized expertise required, the consultant will be hired under a sole source contract. COLMR requires a contractor with substantive knowledge of survey methodology and analysis as well as experiencince in and understanding of VA healthcare and research who can lead and produce a product of high quality.   Boston University is the only University in the city teaching and conducting health services research and also includes a focus on the study of government in healthcare.  This school has also collaborated with VA on past research studies and understands the unique needs of the veteran population and the delivery of healthcare services to veterans. extensive experience with COLMR research projects.  The consultant will work closely and participate with center staff on the planning and conduct of the site visit interviews, on the survey instrument design, on the review of archival data material, data analysis, and report development.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.2 applies:This solicitation will not be posted prior to award because of an exception at FAR 6.02 applies.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-5(a)2 Authorized or required by statute, this procurement is under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Law Title 38 USC sections 8151-8153. 7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.The proposed price for individuals with this level of education, expertise, and related experience is fair and reasonable.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.A review of three other University schools in the Boston area found no source available that can provide the services expressed in section 2.  Harvard University and Boston College have schools of Public Health but without a focus on health management services.  Tufts University has no school of Public Health. 9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.Requirements for research endeavors are very specific in nature and frequently there is only one responsible source.  There is little the agency could do to open this requirement to competition.  This is a procurement under VA Healthcare Resources Sharing Authority Title38 USC sections 8151-8153.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None to date.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a sole source purchase order to Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 22709-2194 for the following services under NAICS Code 541690. The purpose of this request is to acquire services from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) with updating the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) classification system as well as provide technical consultation on the updated HCC system required for maintaining CMS outcome measures; and conducting ad hoc analyses. The Quality Measurement and Health Assessment Group (QMHAG) uses the189 clinically relevant HCC as the grouper for grouping the risk factors for the mortality risk adjustment models used to calculate the mortality and readmission outcome measures reported on Hospital Compare (HC) as required by the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. Under the DRA - which requires hospitals to submit data for specific quality measures for health conditions common among people with Medicare, and which typically result in hospitalization - CMS implemented the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) initiative. This initiative requires all acute care hospitals to continuously submit data regarding quality measures including the mortality and readmission outcome measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Heart Failure (HF) for public reporting on the HC web- site, located at www.medicare.gov. The goal of this initiative is to equip consumers with quality of care information to make more informed decisions about their health care, while encouraging hospitals and clinicians to improve the quality of inpatient care provided to all patients. Under this Statement of Work (SOW), CMS will align its HCC maintenance priorities which are required for the risk adjustment methodology used for reporting the outcome measures on HC with the RTI expertise to facilitate an efficient strategy for updating the HCC for the mortality risk adjustment models. RTI is the original developer of the HCC system that includes 189 HCCs. In 2004, CMS contracted with RTI to develop the system and to maintain the system for payment of health plans. Beginning in 2006, CPC contracted with RTI through sole sourcing to maintain part of the original system (70 of the 189 HCC) for CPC program use. RTI is the only organization that is knowledgeable and experienced with CMS HCCs. Further, since RTI is maintaining part of the HCC system for CPC, it is cost effective and efficient for them to continue maintaining the remaining of the system for QMHAG program use. If QMHAG were to procure another Contractor for the task, that Contractor will need at least 3 months to learn the system in order to perform the work under this contract. It will be costly and inefficient for CMS to pay this 3-month start-up cost. It is also costly and duplicative for CMS to pay a different Contractor to maintain the full set of the system anew when part of the system is currently under maintenance by RTI for CPC. All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency. Expression of interest and statement of capabilities must be email to Lucille.Lee@cms.hhs.gov. Statement of capabilities must be received within 5 days from the published date of this notice. In addition, all interested contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

The following paragraph(s) of 52-212-4 are amended as indicated below:
1. Paragraph(m), Termination for Cause.
Delete paragraph(m) in its entirety and substitute the following: (m) Termination for Cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If this contract is terminated in whole or in part for cause, and the supplies or services covered by the contract so terminated are repurchased
by the Government, the Government will incur administrative costs in such repurchases. The Contractor and the Government expressly agree that, in
addition to any excess costs of repurchase, or any other damages resulting
from such default, the Contractor shall pay, and the Government shall accept, the sum of $1155.00 as payment in full for the administrative costs of such repurchase. This assessment of damages for administrative costs shall apply for any termination for cause following which the Government repurchases the terminated supplies or services together with any incidental or consequential damages incurred because of the termination. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

Blue Ridge Job Corps Center, located at 245 W. Main Street in Marion, VA is soliciting bids for repair of flooring in main building.


SEE ATTACHED SCOPE OF WORK
 

SCOPE OF WORK

Removing several layers of flooring to the original floor joist Blocking, planning, sanding, bridging, and reinforcing framing members to smooth level condition.  Install ¾ T&G stur4dy floor sheeting for a smooth level plane.  Install tarkett #1327 VCT tile using eco friendly mastic.

Remove flooring of approximately 15000 square feet.  Replace and paint all baseboards and flooring molding to compliment the original era of the building.  Fire doors will need to be modified or replaced to allow for lower floors.  Old plaster walls built on top of the floor will need to be replaced due to damage which will occur when removing the old flooring.

Key Date:  Proposal deadline is 11:59pm Alaska time (UTC -8) September 28, 2009
Overview InformationFederal Agency Name:  Alaska Region, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)Opportunity Title:  Sea Duck Joint Venture ProgramAnnouncement Type:  This is an annual request for proposals from the Sea Duck Joint Venture
Full Text of AnnouncementI.  Funding Opportunity DescriptionThe Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of sea ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the SDJV, administers grants, purchase orders, and contracts on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community's understanding of sea duck biology and ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties.
The SDJV is receptive to funding annual projects as well as a limited number of multi-year (up to 3 years) projects.  Successful multi-year projects will be funded in 1-year increments, subject to annual review, demonstration of suitable progress, and funds availability.  After 3 years of consecutive funding, those projects may reapply and compete for SDJV funds in one-year increments only and they will be re-evaluated based on their continued merit.   Note:  Multi-year projects have special reporting requirements that must be addressed in both the proposal and in annual summary reports.   For example, in the proposal, submitters need to clearly define the results that will be attained annually and at the conclusion of the project (e.g., sample sizes, progress of analyses, reports and publications); in the annual summary report, the researcher must address their progress toward meeting annual and overall objectives.  Because multi-year projects commit SDJV funds for extended periods and thus limit the number of other projects which can be funded in subsequent years, they must ensure a good return on investment.  Projects with proven methodology and a high likelihood of success will likely score higher than projects with untested methodology and high risk factors (unsecured funding, weather dependent, etc.).
To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for SDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources.

Examples of Recently Funded Projects: -Spring Migration of Surf Scoters Along the Pacific Coast: Important Habitats and Energetic Implications-Identification of Beaufort Sea Migration Corridor for Sea Ducks-Breeding areas, migration routes, staging, molting, and local movements associated with both Surf and White-winged Scoters wintering in the inner marine waters of Washington State-The Effect of Hunting and Avian Cholera on the St. Lawrence Estuary Common Eiders- Inorganic Contaminant Concentrations and Body Condition of Common Goldeneye Wintering on the Great Salt Lake, Utah-Molt ecology of White-winged Scoters in the St. Lawrence estuary-Temporal and Geographic Distribution of the Aleutian Islands Pacific Common Eider-The value of herring spawn vs. alternative prey to Surf and White-winged Scoters in the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin-Molting Ecology of Surf and White-winged Scoters in Southeast Alaska-Diet of Surf Scoters Molting in Eastern North America-Distribution of Sea Ducks in Southeast Alaska:  Geographic Patterns and Relationships to Coastal Habitats(see http://seaduckjv.org/fund/sdjvfundedstudies09.pdf for additional funded projects)
II.	Award InformationIn FY2009, SDJV received 25 proposals requesting a total of $582,000 and awarded about $376,000 to 14 projects.  The median level of funding was $23,000 (range $10,000 to $39,000).  Most projects funded by SDJV are one-year projects, although multi-year projects have been funded, and will be considered in this funding cycle as well.  Interest in the SDJV is growing rapidly and we anticipate both an increase in the number of funding requests and a decrease in available funds in FY09.  The SDJV encourages modest funding requests.  Previous award winners are eligible and previously funded projects are eligible to compete for supplemental funding with applications for new awards (see section I, above).
Awards will be issued via contracts and purchase orders, based on a Service analysis of the nature of each selected project in light of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.3.  Acquisition instruments will be administered in accordance with FAR Parts 42 through 51, under the appropriate clauses of FAR Part 52, which will include a portion or all of the following clauses, dependant upon the total dollar threshold of the contract or purchase order selected for award:
Each contract or purchase order awarded shall incorporate one or more of the following clauses, by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

III.	Eligibility Information
Eligible Applicants:  Applications are encouraged from nonprofit organizations, public and private educational organizations, federal, state, local, and tribal governments and organizations, foreign governments, and individual companies.  
Cost Sharing or Matching:  To be competitive for funding, proposals should provide at least a 1:1 match for SDJV funds.  The match contribution may include cash or in-kind costs directly associated with the proposed work (also see #14 under Proposal Format, below).  Proposals with less than a 1:1 match will be considered, but will be ranked lower than comparable projects with a full match.  Additionally, proposals citing a match contribution which has its origin from other US Government Federal awards will be ranked lower than proposals citing a match funded through non-federal (i.e. not originally US Government in origin) funds.
Research versus Management Proposals:The SDJV will not accept proposals for sea duck monitoring studies through this Request for Proposals.  In this case, we define monitoring as a study or survey with a primary objective of estimating population size or tracking population trends.  There will be a separate RFP for monitoring studies issued at a later date.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-30.     

This announcement constitutes the only 100% total small business side aside solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 334516, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.  

Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance is significantly more important than price.  

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for an aerosol detector.  The Statement of Work is as follows:

General Duties/Description of Work

The FDA requires a “universal detector” for use with liquid chromatographic (LC) systems to analyze drug residues and xenobiotics in animal tissues, animal feed, and other matrices.  The detector will be used primarily for analysis of non-volatile drugs and metabolites that have no specific UV absorbance and/or fluorescence characteristics. The detector response is independent of chemical structure. The compounds to be monitored are generated during the conduct of metabolism/pharmacokinetic studies that require compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (21 CFR part 58) and electronic records (21 CFR part 11).  The detector must include the following components and meet these specifications:
1	A charged aerosol detection process for measuring concentrations of non-volatile constituents in HPLC assays. 
2	Uses an ambient temperature nebulization system to evaporate the mobile phase and generate an aerosol stream composed of residue particles of all non-volatile constituents..
3	Uses a pressurized inert gas jet to transfer residue particles throughout the detection system.
4	A “corona discharge is used to charge a secondary inert gas stream which merges the the primary particle stream to turbulently mix the gas ions with the aerosol particles.  A unipolar electrical charge, proportional to the particle’s size, is transferred to the non-volatile residue particles, creating a “charged aerosol”.
5	A charge-responsive collector is used to accumulate the electrical signals from the “charged aerosol” and a coupled electrical conductor senses the current generated by collected residue particles.  The captured signal levels correspond directly to the concentration of the non-volatile analyte.  There should be a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude
6	The unit should have a graphical display coupled with a functional and lockable keypad for complete programable control and visual operating status.  
7) 	The unit can be used with isocratic or gradient HPLC modes with both aqueous and volatile solvent-based mobile phases at flow rates of 0.3 - 2.0 mL/min.  It should be compatible with systems using standard and narrow-bore configurations.
8)	On-board microprocessor provides high resolution data (24-bit) and is enabled for external RS-232 control.
9)	Software drivers for direct control and data acquisition via Agilent’s EZchrom Elite and/or Chemstation software.


 Delivery Address: 

8401 Muirkirk Road
Laurel, MD 20708

Equipment Use

The detector must be delivered as a ready-to use units, which must include all the necessary communication cables, and interface cards for connection to the Agilent data system.   The detector package must include an on-site installation with customer familiarization and a one-year warranty.   

Period of Performance

12 months from date of award.

CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun & Bradstreet number and banking information.

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars and NIST 16NiCrMo13 Steel
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number RA1341-09-RQ-0435DR.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is total small business set aside. The associated NAICS code is 331111. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0001 - AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars, Quantity estimated at 7,000 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0002 - 16 Ni CrMo13 Steel Bar - Quantity estimated at 250 to 300 lbs., in accordance with the following specifications.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0001 AISI-SAE 4340 Steel Bars<br />Introduction:<br />The Materials Reliability Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which NIST will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be sold by NIST as standard reference materials to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material. The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />NIST require AISI 4340 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and micro&not;structural variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), NIST will allow some flexibility by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased and setting a maximum of $100,000.00 for the purchase of CLIN No. 0001.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a double-vacuum-melting procedure (vacuum-induction-melt vacuum-arc-remelt, VIM-VAR). The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AISI-SAE alloy 4340. The steel must also meet the stricter requirements of AMS 6414, which describes steel production by a vacuum-melting procedure. In addition, we desire the phosphorus, sulfur, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and copper contents of the steel to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P = 0.010, (2) S = 0.010, (3) V = 0.030, (4) Nb = 0.005, (5) Ti = 0.003, and (6) Cu = 0.35. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, NIST requires that these elements (and inclusions) are at levels typically found for VIM-VAR 4340 steel.</p>
<p>The composition shall be certified using standard analytical procedures (such as optical emission spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence), and the equipment is calibrated by standards traceable to NIST. The composition shall be measured at the top and bottom of the remelted ingot. These two measurements shall be included in the documentation with the order, meet our compositional requirements, and meet the limits on residuals given above. Deviations between the two measurements (in mass percent between the top and bottom of VAR ingot) cannot exceed 0.030 for C, Si, and Mo; 0.10 for Mn; 0.030 for Cr; 0.050 for Ni; 0.003 for P; and 0.001 for S.</p>
<p>Product Form:<br />The ingots shall be forged, rolled to billet, conditioned, then hot rolled to bar. The bar shall be finished to 0.50 inch square bar (+0.15 inch, -0.00 inch) and straighten. The corner radius of the finished bars cannot exceed 0.03 inches. The microstructure shall be uniform through the thickness, with a maximum acceptable grain size of ASTM number 7. In other attributes (decarburization, segregation, surface condition, etc.), the steel must be suitable for use as 10 mm square Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
<p>The 0.50 inch bar shall be fully annealed to a hardness of RB-95 max. The suggested cycle is as follows: (1) heat to 1550 &ordm;F and hold for 6 hours, (2) furnace cool to 1200 &ordm;F and hold 12 hours, and (3) furnace cool to 800 &ordm;F and air cool to room temperature. NIST will accept alternate heat-treating schedules by mutual agreement. The goal is to produce bars with a minimum of large carbides in the structure, the most uniform carbide pre&not;cipitation possible, and a uniform hardness. The bar is required to be machine straightened (for twist and bow), and shipped in lengths of no more than 6 feet.</p>
<p>The bar shall be packaged in bundles identified with reference to the ingot position from which it was processed. This identification is used to limit the material used for a given lot to a single ingot location, which reduces micro-structural inhomogeneities between bars. The bundles must weigh less than 4000 lb, which is the capacity of the NIST fork lift truck.</p>
<p>Specifications for CLIN NO. 0002: NIST 16NiCrMo13 Steel Purchase<br />Introduction:<br />The materials Reliability Division of NIST requires AISI-SAE 4340 steel bars, which we will use to produce precisely machined and heat treated Charpy V-notch specimens. These specimens shall be evaluated by NIST for use as a standard reference material to certify the performance of Charpy V-notch impact machines. The steel must be of the highest quality possible to ensure uniform impact properties and long term stability (resistance to aging) of the reference material The American Society for Testing Materials specification E23 describes this test and these specimens.</p>
<p>Compositional and melting requirements:<br />We require 16NiCrMo13 steel bars, from a single heat to minimize compositional and microstructure variation. Because steel plants produce steel in different heat sizes (inherent to their facilities), we allow some flexibility in our contract by bracketing the quantity of the steel to be purchased.</p>
<p>The steel shall be produced using a vacuum-induction-melt (VIM) to produce a 6 inch diameter electrode, which is then electro slag re-melted (ESR) to an 8 inch diameter ingot. The goal here is to achieve deep desulfurization and refinement of non-metallic inclusions, a homogenous distribution of non-metallic inclusions, a fine-uniform grain structure, and low macrosegregation.</p>
<p>The steel shall meet the compositional requirements of AFNOR NFA35565(94). In addition, we desire the phosphorus, vanadium, titanium, and boron levels to be low. The maximum concentrations (in mass %) allowed for these elements shall be: (1) P =0.02, (2) V = 0.02, (3) Ti = 0.01, and B = 0.005. Maximum concentrations for nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are not specified, however, we require that these elements (and inclusions) are at low levels typically found for VIM-ESR steel. Reasonable modifications can be requested for the compositional requirements.</p>

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter’s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor 1-Technical Capability: Technical capability subfactors: Quotations will be evaluated on the vendor's ability to: 1. Provide the required services on the dates requested. 2. Meet the minimum requirements regarding lodging, meeting space, food and beverage service, audio visual equipment and technical support, business center requirements, reporting requirements, and the vendor's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to lodging and meeting space.; and 3. Provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, local restaurants, and other area attractions. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area.  Quotations must address the quality of the customer services provided, and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.  

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The vendor must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of federal, and/or state and local government agency or other non-government client; 2. Name, titles and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements.  

Factor 3 – Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate. 

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government ‘ Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child Labor – Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, Clause 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, Clause 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, Clause 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, and Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer ‘ Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>Statement of Work
Revision 0, June 2, 2009  
Project Controls Cost Processor
Introduction:
Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (SNJV) under Prime Contract to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration, Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO) is looking to purchase software for SNJV’s Project Controls to integrate data from a project’s baseline schedule, status and forecast schedule, and actual cost data from accounting. 
Background:
Currently, SNJV Project Controls utilizes Primavera Project Management as the primary scheduling and cost collecting tool.  Each project requires two project files: the Baseline file and the Status file.  
The Baseline file contains the original baseline along with the incremental changes that have been approved during the life of the project.  If there are no approved changes in the current month, then there are no changes to the baseline during that month.  
The Status file contains current period and cumulative project status.  During the life of the project, the following activities occur on a monthly basis and are updated in the Status file: 
1.	The status date is updated to the current fiscal month-end-date. 
2.	Performance is calculated and applied to the appropriate activities in the file.  
3.	 Requirements to complete activities are forecasted and updated in the “Estimate-to-Complete” or “ETC” field.  
4.	 Actuals are manually inputted.
The steps required to calculate the actual costs, match them to a specific charge number, identifiy the activity within the P6 schedule, and hand key the entry for numerous entries per month has resulted in many discrepancies over the last year.  SNJV requires a system with the ability to integrate the baseline, performance, forecast and the actual costs.
Description of Work:
Provide a software solution that meets the following identified criteria:
Integrate Baseline, Performance, and Forecast data from Primavera Project Management 6.X. 
Primavera P6.2 is the current software version being utilized to maintain baseline and status files.  To facilitate the integration of these files into a Project Controls Cost Processor (PCCP), the ideal solution would have a simple integration wizard that would pull file data into the appropriate location within the PCCP application. Solutions which require exporting and importing are less desirable than an automated import feature that directly pulls the schedules from the P6.2 database and loads it into the cost processor.
Integrate labor hours/costs, ODC's, and accruals from Deltek GCS Premier.
The current process takes the file that contains actual costs, running pivot tables on the data to sum the costs for charge codes, and SNJV Project Controls manually inputting the codes into P6.X.  The preferred method would be for the cost processor application to use a wizard to pull the actual costs from Deltek GCS Premier directly into the PCCP.
As mentioned above, exporting a flat file from Deltek and then reimporting it into a cost processor is a viable method.  However, the desired method would involve less manual manipulation with files: an import wizard feature or mapping feature that directly pulls from Deltek GCS Premier into the cost processor application is the desired method.
Earned-Value (EV) compliant application 
One of the fundamental requirements of the PCCP application is the ability to provide Earned-Value Reporting.  The standard for earned value is specified in greater detail in DOE Order 413.3 and ANSI Standard 748.  The selected systems must be able to generate standard EV reports such as Cost Performance Reports (CPR’s) in a variety of formats (i.e., Standard Formats 1 through 5).  Other typical reports include Variance Reports, CFSR, CSSR, etc.  While not all applications may provide these types of reports, the CPR formatted reports are a necessity.   Also, while applications may provide the desired EV reports they may not be specifically EV certified.  The selected PCCP application shall have the capability to be EV certified.
Technology & integration competency.  MS SQL Server 2005 compatible.
Currently, the sole database solution used is MS SQL 2005.  By reducing to strictly a Microsoft shop, fewer servers, less training, and less hardware is required.   The selected software must run on MS SQL Server 2005 and later versions. Products that run on multiple platforms including MS SQL Server 2005 are preferred.  Software that does not function with this server will not be considered.
Lock down historical data, prevent inadvertent changes to history.
The selected PCCP application must possess features to prevent changes from occuring.  As each fiscal month period closes, the system needs be locked (this includes all prior months) which will prevent any chance of inadvertent changes.  The only individuals who will have access to write to past period data will be the database administrator or the PCCP System Administrator.  
If the system lacks features for systematically locking past monthly data, the vendor shall provide a detailed plan on how the proposed system is to be used to prevent historical data changes from occurring.  
Ability to secure system, data, & reports based upon user roles.
Appropriate levels of security shall be included in the product.  For example, the PCCP Administrator shall have the highest level of security access for the system while a project controls engineer shall have a lower level of access to certain application features.  Project controls associates with report-only access would have the lowest level of security which allows for read-only access.  Allowing access based upon user name would be one method.  The ideal method would be to grant access based upon a role and granting a specific individual the rights of the role.  
Provide specifics on how your system will support multiple levels of security/access.
 If the application provides read-only access for reporting purposes, this should be identified as a separate line item in the proposal.
Ability to query the data underlying the reports and export the data.
Although the application may have a variety of pre-canned reports, accessing the underlying data to develop ad-hoc reports is a significant feature.  If the data is accessable, then there should be a variety of ways to export the data (i.e., Excel, CSV, etc.) so that additional analysis can be performed by the project controls team.  
Ability to archive the data within the application or to a data-warehouse.
Ideally, the selected PCCP application would include a feature to archive the data within the system.  This archived data would also be available for queries or historical reporting; i.e., running an end-of-year Cost Performance Report from the final period of the prior year.  
If an application does not include the ability to archive the data within the PCCP application, then include a recommended process to archive the data externally as well as a processor for running historical reports based upon the month-end or fiscal-year-end datum from past periods.
Company's overall related work experience with DOE user-base, recent projects, & qualifications.
All work performed by SNJV is for DOE, proposer’s experience with DOE projects and contractors is of high importance.  If firm has DOE experience utilizing the proposed software, provide three names with the name of the specific project. 
Adequacy of staff skills, certifications, product support & response times. 
Occasionally SNJV requires assistance for end-user configuration and larger systems issues such as database recovery.  The successful offeror must have qualified, trained individuals on staff to assist in resolving these issues and have a level of profficiency with the tools as acquired from an educational program, certification program, and work experience.  
Product Support is required during SNJV’s hours of operation: Monday through Friday, 7 am to 5 pm, Pacific Standard Time, with a response time of 1 hour.   Occasionally, the SNJV team may work extended hours or on weekends.  The successful offeror shall provide additional after hours support to assist with unplanned issues regarding the PCCP.  Provide assignment of product support personnel. 
Time requirements to become proficient with the application.
It is essential that the application be inherent to learning and that the successful offeror provides adequate training.  To reduce the learning curve for the PCCP users, a three or four-day training course is required as well as a one or two-day administrators training course.  Training is a requirement.
Preferred Background:
The successful offeror shall have a minimum of five years product experience.   Please provide references and specify the company’s name, and project utilizing the cost processor application.  Also, provide references from these clients providing input regarding what has been working and not working for them.
Delivery Date:
Delivery date is five workings days after date of award. Installation and training will be established at time of award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirement 
4)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirement 

The Contractor shall comply with the higher standard selected below, or equivalent standard.  If more than one standard is listed, the offer shall indicate its selection by checking the appropriate block.

Title 			Number		Date		Tailoring	     Check Block

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

The purpose of amendment two (2) is to answer to recent questions regarding the solicitation or concerns from interested parties. The following questions have been submitted to the NIST office. 

1. The specs for this cluster machine do not stipulate any particular vendor’s equipment so we would like to know if we can respond with other Brands.   
 
Response: There is no restriction on brand name(s) being offered.

2. What comprises the “cluster”?  Are you requesting 14 nodes or do you want 14 nodes with storage?

Response: NIST requires 14 nodes.  Storage will be local to each node using the SATA drives listed in the requirements.

3. What is the rational for 1.5TB SATA desktop-class hard drive? Is this a requirement or would you consider others? 

Response: The 1.5TB SATA desktop-class is a minimum specification; enterprise class drives are not required.

4. Is there a preference for INTEL or AMD? 

Response: No. The processor simply needs to meet or exceed the minimum requirements specified in the solicitation.

5. The compute nodes call out for QTY 14 which is clear but under the individual item quantity’s you list QTY 2 x 2U chassis. Please clarify.

Response: Each node shall be in a single (2U) chassis.

6. The drive sizes are to be 1TB or larger listed on the compute node but in the below section QTY 90 1.5TB drives are requested. Where the 1.5TB drives are going? 

Response: All drives will go into computer nodes.  The drives shall be 1TB or larger.

7. For your 48 port Ethernet switch do you want none blocking and Scalable? 

Response: This cluster will be in a single rack and the switch only needs to support these nodes.  Each node will have dual gigabit Ethernet links.  The remaining ports will support either node management or uplink/crosslink to other systems. NIST doesn’t require a managed switch.

8. Have you considered Infiniband for your MPI traffic?
 
Response: NIST’s minimum requirements are those specified in the solicitation.


9. Do you already have master node in place?

Response: No, one of these nodes being procured will act as the master.

10. AMD or Intel? The Nahalem is Quad core and the Istambul is 6 core? 2GHz or faster what is your preference?

Response: No restriction applies to brand name offered. The minimum requirement is: Quad-core, 2.3 ghz or higher.

11. 40 Cat 6 cables why?

Response: NIST requires two Cat6 cables to connect the nodes at reliable gigabit rates, plus an additional per node for management (if node management requires an additional connection)

12.  Why 2U Chassis? Normal compute nodes are 1U with 4 x removable drives.

Response: NIST intends to put at least four of the 1TB (or larger) drives in each node, in addition to the system disk.  If the Offeror can fit this requirement in a 1U chassis, then that would be acceptable.
      
13. Item List table is amended as follows:

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective March 19, 2009. This requirement will be a set aside 100% for Small Business concerns and shall remain open for responsible sources to respond.    The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561920 with a size standard of $7.0 million in revenue.   Contractors are required to identify their company’s business size.  TSA plans to establish a single firm fixed priced contract; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any contract. The resultant Purchase Order (PO) award will be 7 months in duration.  The firm fixed price will be determined based on a breakdown of all costs, materials, labor. The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized purchases made under the contract. 

BACKGROUND

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) works to ensure the security of rail and mass transit passengers, employees, and properties.  Ensuring this high level of security requires the sharing of safety and security policies, procedures, and smart practices from the nation’s mass transit systems. 

Congress directed TSA, in Public Law 110-53 (August 2007) to consult with relevant security partners, including public transportation agencies, to share security information. 

SCOPE

To enhance mass transit security, TSA in cooperation with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and the National Preparedness Directorate of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) agree to host a 3-day Security and Safety Roundtable conference that will include the participation of the Security Chiefs/Coordinators and Safety Directors from the Nation’s 100 largest mass transit agencies.  This conference is a forum for the federal government and its security partners to discuss critical issues relating to the security and safety of the mass transit mode of transportation.  The Security and Safety Roundtable will be held on December 9, 10 and 11, 2009 in Phoenix, Arizona.

The objectives necessary to fulfill the purpose of this SOW include the following:

Question: request clarification on the requirement for Sections 1 and 2 of the solicitation.  It appears the same data is required fretionaetmatalqprr

Response - Paraphrasing liberally from "Formation of Government Contracts" Third Addition, Cibinic and Nash, page 737: The discussion involved distinguising between "experience" and "past performance".  The question to ask regarding experience would be  - What have they done?  The question to ask regarding past performance would be  - How well have they done it?  Both evaluation factors delve into the past of the vendor's performance but from entirely different aspects and looked at respective to the aspect.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FEDBIZOPS is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FEDBIZOPS is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Carderock Division." Request for Information: This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The purpose of this RFI is to determine capability and to assess the experience of the current industry to meet the objectives stated below.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.Objective: Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD)/ Ships Systems Engineering Station (SSES), Philadelphia, has an interest in obtaining information about fire detection systems for shipboard applications that would activate sprinkling or fire suppression systems.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential suppliers.   The system shall consist of individually addressable, electronic, spot type, restorable, fixed temperature heat detectors; an air aspirated smoke detection system, a fire alarm control panel, and isolators or detector bases for the heat detectors which contain isolators.  The fire detection system equipment shall be listed or approved by a national or international standards organization or be approved by the Naval Technical Authority.  The system shall be capable of detecting and reporting the existence of fire threats, automatically activating a third-party sprinkling or fire suppression system, and reporting status signals (e.g., alar m, trouble and supervisory signals) to the ship's remote alarm notification system.  The air aspirated smoke detection system (which shall only provide early warning alarm indications and not actuate the sprinkling or fire suppression system) shall interface with the fire alarm control panel.  The spot type heat detectors shall provide alarm ! indications and shall automatically activate the sprinkling or fire suppression system.  The primary source of power for the fire alarm control panel shall be 120 VAC shipboard power in accordance with MIL-STD-1399.  A secondary power supply (e.g., back up batteries) shall be included which has sufficient capacity to operate the system under quiescent load (system operating in a non alarm condition) for a minimum of 24 hours.  The fire alarm control panel shall contain any transformers required to provide the power necessary for the air aspirated smoke detection system and the heat detectors.  Relays to activate the sprinkling or fire!   suppression system shall also be contained within the fire alarm control panel. The fire alarm control panel and the air aspirated smoke detection system shall interface (i.e., be integrated together).  The system shall be capable of displaying locally all sensor alarm, trouble and supervisory signals and analog temperature measurement informa! tion to an integrated LCD display.  The overall system shall be a Class A Signaling Line Circuit (SLC) type system in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) National Fire Alarm Code NFPA 72 and be survivable in the event of open, shorted, or grounded sensor cabling.  The isolators or heat detector bases which contain isolators shall be installed on the heat detector sensor loops to protect detectors from short circuits on other sections of the detector cabling.  The system shall have the software capability of easily adjusting or switching alarm thresholds (but only with password or other security protectio! n)  for the air aspirated smoke detection system and the heat detectors and automatically logging all alarm and trouble events.       Additional information is also sought, if known, concerning the system's resistance to shipboard environmental requirements (beyond commercial specifications), such as MIL-S-901D shock (Grade A, Class 1, Type A, hull mounted), MIL-STD-167-1 or MIL-STD-167-1A vibration (Type 1, exploratory, variable frequency, and endurance), MIL-STD-461F Electromagnetic Interference  (CE101, CE102, CS101, CS106, CS114, CS116, RE101, RE102, RS101, RS103 (25 V/m)), and the overall system's resistance to higher than normal temperatures (e.g., 150  degrees Fahrenheit or above).  Information is also sought on real time measurement capabilities of the spot type heat detectors.  Specifically, is the system capable of displaying actual real time temperature measurements for each heat sensor (i.e., not solely their alarm threshold temperatures) and, if yes, what range of temperatures is capable of being measured/displayed? RFI Content: Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 35 pages, 12 font with single spacing (Additional test reports, if available, that specifically describe/document  the system's successful resistance to shock, vibration, EMI, and/or high temperature are not subject to this limitation).  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to, a Company History.  A one page history should include: Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, and primary customer base.  Additional technical or other information that the company deems necessary to aid the Government in making an informed assessment should also be included (such as system and component data sheets, pricing information, lists of existing shipboard users of the system, etc.).  Submission Information: RFI responses shall be submitted no later than 05 June 2009 to: NSWCCD/SSES Philadelphia, 5001 S. Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pa 19112, Attn: Mr. Al Peters, Code 668.  Electronic responses are preferred and should be submitted to alfred.peters@navy.mil, with the email subject line reading, "FEDBIZOPS Fire Detection/Actuation System submission."  Additional Information: Any information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  NSWCCD may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.  At no cost to the Government, the government may request further clarification of a contractor's submission.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center has a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) in place that was issued on a sole-source basis to Raytheon McKinney TX for the repair, production, engineering services, maintenance and upgrade of the AN/AAS-44(V)FLIR system and the AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems, and other derivatives.  These systems are used on the SH-60 multi-mission helicopters and other Platforms.  The BOA was placed in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 in the estimated amount of $948 million on 20 APR 2006. The period of the BOA is for five years (3 basic and 2 one-year options).  The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement through any other source. 
This synopsis is issued to advertise the options and requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a twelve-month period.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Point of Contact is Ms. Vonda Pollock, Code 0565ZH, Bldg 3291, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522 5001.  Telephone 812-854-3683, or FAX 812-854-5066.  The contracting officer is Mary Sheetz, code 0565, telephone 812-854-3716.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis, will be considered by the Government. !  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>
Final Exploratory Research Questions & Answers

1.	If a proposed concept has applicability to more than one sub-topic, is it permissible to indicate this in the proposal and will it be considered in the evaluation of the proposal? 

ANS:  The proposal will be evaluated in one and only one sub-topic assignment.  It is recommended that the offeror select that sub-topic most suited for their proposed solution. The Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) may place the proposal in a different sub-topic area at their discretion prior to evaluation.  Encouraged White Papers may have recommendations as to which sub-topic the proposal is most relevant. 
                          
2.	 Since the "General Research" and "Applied Development Leading to Proof-of-Concept Demonstration" approaches have very different phase structures, do the two approaches have the same requirements for the SOW, costing, etc. in the proposal?  If not, what are the separate requirements for each approach in terms of the detail required for phases after Phase I? 

ANS: For BAA solicitations, the SOW and costing details are provided by the Offeror in their proposal.  It is up to the Offeror to select the best phased structure that minimizes R&D risk for the government.  The tasking details for the initial phase must be provided in sufficient detail to supply a clear understanding the Offerors technical approach.  The follow-on phases, if funded, will be clarified in greater detail at the end of the previous phase.  Follow the ER BAA for additional directions. 

Topic Area 4.1:
1.	May one assume that when a proposal only addresses certain parts of the  topic, the government will make suitable data samples, simulated or real, available as GFI?

ANS:  If government furnished material, information or facilities are required to carry out a proposed R&D effort, these should be clearly stated in the proposal.

Topic Area 3.2:
1.	Is there a requirement to inspect in addition to the body, the empennage, wings, engines and tail?

ANS:  For this ER BAA, the technology concept should be applicable to the entire aircraft, but for the ER Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration, it will be limited to several facsimile sections (with realistic layers of appropriate material) to be selected in Phase I. 

2.	Would there be cargo loaded in the aircraft that requires inspection? Note that specifications of the interrogating system would strongly depend on this.

ANS: For general aviation, baggage and cargo will be removed and processed separately by customs; or will be processed in advance of loading, at the port of departure.
 
3.	We understand that the final system would inspect from a Cessna to an A380? Do you intend vendors to demonstrate a system that will cover this range? Otherwise, could you please provide guidelines about the airplane size that would be used to demonstrate system? Note that the project cost will depend on this.

ANS: For the proposal, Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration will likely be applied to mid-sized airplane facsimiles that will be selected in Phase I. 

4.	Obviously the size of the exclusion should be as small as possible. However, what is the largest acceptable exclusion-zone size?

ANS: For the ER BAA PoC, this is left to the Offeror to decide. 

5.	Has DNDO selected a site where to perform the POC demonstration? Or does DNDO want the vendors to come up with the site?  If the former, how long would the system be at the demonstration site? 

ANS: For the ER BAA PoC, this is left to the Offeror to decide. 

Topic Area  3.1: 

1.                 Human Portable Systems, and to help better guide the exploratory research and development, please provide anticipated requirements and goals for the following performance and system specifications: 

•	size of inspection volume, 
•	number of sides accessible (1 or more), 
•	environmental conditions, 
•	distance to target from inspection system, 
•	minimum target mass, 
•	distribution of targets in inspection volume, 
•	amount/type of target shielding, 
•	inspection time, 
•	system setup/teardown time, 
•	battery life (if desired) and 
•	dose limitations.

ANS:   The requirements and goals of the technology concept and the PoC demonstration system should be defined by the Offeror in the proposal.  Items that provide the greatest Transformation Impact (Criterion I) should be emphasized.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY REPLACES THE ORIGINAL SUMMARY THAT WAS FIRST POSTED 5/27/2009.  THE RESPONSE DEADLINE IS EXTENDED TO 6/19/2009.

SUMMARY REQUIREMENT:
The General Services Administration (GSA) desires to lease between 11,613 rentable square feet (RSF) and 12,774 RSF of office and related space, yielding between 10,098 ANSI/BOMA Office area (formerly usable) square feet (USF) and 11,107 USF of either build-to-suit or existing modern office space.  The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  A minimum of 62 outside/surface parking spaces are required (31 employee; 31 visitor), with employee parking separate from visitor parking.

BUILDING REQUIREMENT:
The facility must be professional in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction.  The space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare will not be considered in the following instances:  (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block; or (2) if access to the location is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks (or an equivalent distance) from the proposed office space.  Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Space shall not be located within a base floodplain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  For new construction and existing space, a setback of 20 feet is required.

The requested space must be fully serviced, and in a building capable of being altered to meet the Government’s needs and security requirements as well as the Government’s requirements for fire and life safety and handicap accessibility.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Space shall be on the second floor, shall be contiguous, and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls.  Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 28 feet apart center-to-center, and 28 feet from any interior wall and be no more than two feet square; space should not be “U” or “L” shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:3.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space, extremely long or narrow runs of space, irregularly shaped space configurations, or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Elevator service must consist of a minimum of two industrial, handicap accessible elevators (only one may serve as a freight elevator).

Public transportation, if available, must be within two blocks of the space.  In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space.  Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed.  “Reasonable rates” will be determined by local pricing levels.

In those locations where on site parking is not available, parking for the disabled must be located within the same block.  In addition, GSA will contact local authorities and request the placement of a loading/unloading zone in front of the office for the disabled and other visitors.  A request to GSA will also be made on behalf of disabled employees in those locations where on site parking is not available.

Availability of public transportation, public and commercial parking, and on site parking shall be considered as award factors in evaluating offers, but not as requirements of the Solicitation for Offers (S.F.O).  Locations which meet SSA space requirements and have on site parking for visitors and employees shall be given priority consideration during the process of evaluating offers from potential lessors.

Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking requirements.  This is because many SSA contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.

Failure to meet the above parking requirements constitutes grounds for rejecting a site.

LOCATION / DELINEATED AREA:
The building offered must be located in Galveston County, TX, within the following boundaries:

North:  FM646
East:  One mile east of I-45
South:  Galveston Island (including the entire island)
West:  One mile west of I-45

LEASE TERM:
The term is for fifteen (15) years, ten (10) years firm.

Expressions of interest should include the following:
Building name and address or, for unimproved sites, provide specific location.
One-eighth scale drawing of space offered or, for unimproved sites, provide site plan and location map.
Confirm BOMA method of measurement, usable yield for available space by floor, and building common area factor.
Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted.

Owners and Authorized Agents:
Brokers and agents may represent prospective landlords, but any properties or proposals submitted by the brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.

Authorized contacts:
In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of the GSA.

Responses to this ad should be received by June 19, 2009 referencing project No. 9TX2150.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W56HZV-n-a.<br><br>Introduction:<BR>The Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) has been in the USMC inventory since 1983.  Since the initial fielding of the FOLAV there have been two major upgrades; the Service Life Extension Program LAV-A1 (SLEP) (1998-2002) and the LAV-A2 Survivability Upgrade (LAV A2 SU) (2006-2010).  While these upgrades extended the primary systems service life of the FOLAV through 2025, the upgrades did not address the variant specific 'subsystem mission suites' on the LAV-ATA2.  Basic characteristics of the LAV platform are provided in Attachment 1 of this RFI.<BR><BR>The LAV-ATA2's 'subsystem mission suite' has become difficult to support and several subcomponents are obsolete.  In fact, the M901A1 TOW has reached the point of ever increasing obsolescence limiting it to USMC inventory.  As part of additional service life extension and fleet upgrade efforts, PM-LAV is evaluating improvements to the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system. The specific purpose of this program is to improve the supportability and mission effectiveness of the LAV-ATA2 by providing the following 'mission suite upgrades':<BR>        1. An Anti-Tank weapon station with:<BR><BR>* Multiple reload, and rapid capability<BR>* Ability to facilitate multiple target engagements in high intensive fights<BR>* An effective platform for Elevated TOW Systems (ETS), and offers the LAR Battalion a precision long-range capability to destroy the enemy<BR>* A second generation thermal sight and an advanced fire control system capable of firing the current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles<BR>* Improved reliability, availability, and maintainability<BR><BR> 2. Turret Trainers for the Operational Forces and float assets for each of the<BR>      Maintenance Centers<BR>      <BR>      <BR>The following are specific objectives of this program:<BR><BR>* Provide the LAV-AT mission suite upgrades initial operational capability by May 13, 2013 and full operational capability by August 3rd 2016<BR>* Meet all threshold key performance parameters<BR>* Improve LAV-AT  readiness by greater than 10% and reduce the operational and support cost by greater than 5%<BR><BR>The deliverables/resultant products of this effort will be 115 LAV-AT modernized with the mission suite upgrades, nine LAV-AT Turret Trainers, two turrets float assets with all mission suite upgrades applied.  In addition meet all milestones and provide supporting documentation required per SECNAV Instruction 5000.2D (unless otherwise directed by MARCORPSYSCOM ACPROG authority).<BR><BR>It is anticipated that after receipt of information from the respondents of this RFI, the government will conduct a trade study followed by a downselect process to determine several leading turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system solution candidates that will undergo additional evaluation.  The evaluation will include ergonomic assessments, spaceclaim and mounting studies, human factors studies, modeling and simulation. Turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system samples may also be acquired for physical measurement, performance evaluations, and testing.  The proposed solutions will be evaluated against current and future mission profiles and the impact of the design on life cycle cost of the LAV system.  <BR>Specific areas of evaluation for the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system trade study and downselect include these requirements (T = threshold / O = Objective):<BR>* effectively acquire, engage, and destroy threat main battle tanks beyond the range of enemy tank main guns (T)								<BR>* ability to destroy bunkers and concrete buildings that harbor threat (T)<BR>* allow for search and target acquisition while stationary (T)			<BR>* allow for search and target acquisition on the move (O)<BR>* allow rapid transition from battlefield movement to target engagement (T)<BR>* acquire targets, fire, and reload while under armor protection (T)<BR>* acquire targets, fire, and reload from inside the vehicle (O)<BR>* fire from a short halt (T)<BR>* fire on the move (O)<BR>* acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament in a 3600 field of fire (T)<BR>* acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament, day or night, under obscured conditions of smoke, fog, haze and dust (T)<BR>* store and fire a minimum of 2 ready rounds in launcher and minimum of 14 stored rounds  (T)<BR>* store and fire a minimum of 4 ready rounds (O)<BR>* capable of fire multiple missiles without reloading (T)<BR>* have an automatic loader or have the capability of being retro-fit with an automatic loader (O)<BR>* accommodate ground mounting when necessary (T)<BR>* fire current and next generation USMC inventory heavy anti-armor missiles (T)<BR>* provide fire and forget anti-tank weapon system capability (O)<BR>* training commonality for current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles (O)<BR>* LAV-AT crew consists of four Marines (T)<BR>* Full mission capability with three personnel (O)<BR>* achieve a Probability of Hit of .75 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (T)<BR>* achieve a Probability of Hit of .9 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (O)<BR>* achieve compatibility with the LAV-AT secondary armament (M240E1, 7.62 mm machine gun pintle, with azimuth and elevation travel locks with a minimum 1800 arc traverse and accessible through the commander's hatch) (T)<BR>* have degraded capability to permit targets to be acquired and destroyed when the main power and /or hydraulic system of the LAV-AT have failed (O)<BR>Responses should include descriptions of sustainment characteristics such as reliability Mean Miles Between Failures (MMBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), commonality with other systems, and in theater sustainment.  Additional technical data will likely be requested from participating turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system manufacturers, including spaceclaim and interface drawings, prior test data, mass properties, and dynamic stiffness characteristics.  This information will be applied to the validated modeling and simulation environment.  Results of the evaluation will be shared with each potential supplier as may be appropriate. <BR><BR>If you are interested in participating in this LAV upgrade effort, please respond by completing the Attachment 2 questionnaire (below) and send it to:<BR>  Dan Marcantonio<BR>  Procurement Analyst<BR>  daniel.marcantonio@us.army.mil <BR>  586-574-9062<BR><BR>Please feel free to include any additional product brochures, test results, technical data, etc. that you believe is relevant to the LAV application.<BR><BR>Thank you in advance for your help on our trade study for the LAV turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system and we look forward to continued discussion on this project. <BR><BR>Attachment 1 - USMC Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) Characteristics<BR><BR> The LAV is a family of 8x8 wheeled, diesel-powered, lightly-armored vehicles combining speed, mobility and firepower to fulfill a variety of missions for the U.S. Marine Corps.  The versatile LAV brings Marines to the fight on land and in water while also providing a weapons platform for anti-tank missiles and mortars, functioning as a command and control vehicle, or performing logistical and recovery tasks.  LAVs are equipped with twin aft propellers and rudders and can attain 6.5 mph in calm waters of rivers or for fording streams.  <BR>The LAV-AT provides ballistic protection equivalent to the base chassis.  The vehicle provides the vehicle commander and gunner with full 360 visibility in the closed hatch mode via periscopes.  The primary weapon is a hydraulically powered M901 Anti-Tank TOW missile weapon station and target acquisition system.  The LAV-AT has a crew of four.<BR>The LAV entered the Marine Corps in 1983 with a service life expectation of 2005.  As of 2007, the Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) has been in service for more than 24 years and is now projected to remain in service until at least 2025.  Through programs of service life extension, upgrades to armor and armament, along with survivability and capability enhancements the LAV remains fully ready for the battlefields of the 21st century.<BR>LAV Specifications and Performance<BR>Length<BR>20.96 ft (6.39 m)<BR>Width<BR>8.20 ft (2.50 m)<BR>Height<BR>8.83 ft (2.69 m)<BR>Weight<BR>14.1 tons (12.8 m-tons)<BR>Engine<BR>Detroit Diesel 6V53T 275 Hp diesel<BR>Transmission<BR>Allison MT653 5 fwd, 1 rev<BR>Drive<BR>(8x8) Rear two axles full time, front two axles selectable<BR>Differentials<BR>Four for wheeled axles, two for water propellers<BR>Armament (LAV-AT)<BR>M901A1 Anti-Tank TOW missile weapon station<BR>A M240 7.62mm medium machine gun<BR>Two 4-barrel grenade launchers<BR>Ammunition (LAV-AT)<BR>2 ready rounds and 14 stored rounds of TOW missiles<BR>200 ready rounds, 800 stowed rounds of 7.62mm <BR>8 ready rounds and 8 stowed rounds of smoke grenades<BR>Max speed (highway)<BR>60 mph<BR>Max grade<BR>60%<BR>Max side slope<BR>30%<BR>Acceleration<BR>0-20mph, less than 10 sec.<BR>Vertical step capability<BR>18 inches<BR>Cruising range<BR>400 miles<BR>Ground clearance<BR>14 inches<BR>Air transportable<BR>C130 Hercules, CH53E Sea Stallion<BR><BR>LAV Configurations<BR>There are more than 700 LAVs in the Marine Corps 2007 inventory, fielded in one of seven different model variants or configurations:<BR>LAV-25, base model, armed with an M242 25mm chain gun<BR>LAV-AT, Antitank, equipped with TOW missile system<BR>LAV-C2, Command and Control (C2)<BR>LAV-L, Logistics vehicle, providing cargo and maintenance capacity<BR>LAV-M, Mortar 81mm Mortar carrier<BR>LAV-R, Recovery vehicle<BR>LAV-MEWSS, Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System<BR><BR><BR>Attachment 2 - Turret and Heavy Anti-Armored Weapon System Questionnaire<BR><BR>1.

<AWARDEE>The Boeing Company, JS McDonnell Blvd

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) issued the subject modification to establish new T&M rates and increase the existing time & material ceiling in order to issue additional sole source task orders under Contract N00019-03-C-0055.  The new T&M ceiling is approximately 9% of the total contract ceiling on N0019-03-C-0055,  Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS), to The Boeing Company, McDonnell Douglas Training & Support Systems (MDTSS).  The associated task orders will allow the Navy to procure specialized engineering technical services in support of RTCASS and RTCASS subsystems at the Boeing facility in St. Louis, MO. NAVAIR is contemplating issuing these task orders in CY2009-2010.

Sole Source Rationale
Technical data packages are required for the RTCASS and RTCASS subsystems, including Inter Connect Documents (ICD) in order to perform engineering technical services including, but not limited to engineering investigations, product improvements and integration of ancillary equipment.  The technical data is currently owned by the contractor and the final configuration, including subsystems and ICDs will not be finalized and accepted by the Government until the risk of integrating current ancillary candidates is diminished. This is estimated to be completed by the fourth quarter CY2010. This anticipated timeline of the finalized technical data does not meet the Government’s need to deliver RTCASS to the fleet beginning first quarter CY2009 followed by the ancillary off load effort.
