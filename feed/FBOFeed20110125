<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Strata Products Worldwide, LLC for a HazardAvert Proximity Detection System.
<p>Purpose and objective: The current prototype of the NIOSH Intelligent Proximity Detection system, installed on a Joy 14CM continuous mining machine at the lab in Pittsburgh, utilizes a four-generator, 12V proximity system. However, the range of this system is inadequate to provide complete coverage over the entire continuous mining machine. Therefore, an expanded range (six-generator, 24V) system is needed. This expanded range will allow research to continue as planned with the development and testing of the intelligent system. Strata Products Worldwide offers the only product, the HazardAvert proximity detection system, that is capable of meeting the required performance specifications. Specifically, HazardAvert is the only system that operates at the frequency that is (according to previous NIOSH research) least susceptible to the effects of metallic objects. Additionally, an initial prototype was previously developed that utilizes a less advanced version of the HazardAvert system. Software was developed for this prototype system and will be used with the planned system as well. Therefore, the selected system is the only product that will be immediately compatible with the software without significant modifications.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13181. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Strata Products worldwide, LLC, 8995 Roswell Rd. Ste. 200, Sandy Springs, GA 30350 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<p>DoDEA hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) from any curriculum vendors who would like to submit information relative to DoDEA's plan to use existing Vendor Driven Online Ordering Systems for the future Science Curriculum Buys.

<p>DoDEA plans to include in its RFQs for those Science contracts a request for vendors to submit a plan for DoDEA to use their current online ordering systems should they have a system. To that end and in light of the DoDEA Online Ordering System Vision described and dialogued at the 20 January 2011 HQ DoDEA Industry Day, DoDEA is asking all potential curriculum vendors to submit any information they feel would be valuable for DoDEA to know at this point in the pre-solicitation process. All information submitted will be kept confidential; however, information submitted may be used to craft a more effective Online Ordering System instruction for the RFQs. <br /><br /><br />Responses to this RFI are due by 11 AM Eastern Time, Tuesday, February 1, 2011 by email to Julie Brooke at Julie.brooke@hq.dodea.edu.

The Contractor is required to provide complete supply chain management to include all procurement and ordering of HM for DLA customers in accordance with the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). The solicitation will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract with Cost Reimbursement (no fee)(CR) contract line items (CLINs). The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs/ travel/training costs will be reimbursed under the CR (no fee) portion of any resultant contract.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Sirius Program on February 24, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on Sirius, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities and find potential team partners. This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.<br /> <br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />A broad consensus exists that human decision making relies on a repertoire of simple, fast, heuristic decision rules that are used in specific situations. These decision rules can bias general problem-solving in ways that produce erroneous results. When an intelligence problem invokes these biases, analysts may draw inferences or adopt beliefs that are logically unsound or not supported by evidence. Cognitive biases in analysis tend to increase with the level of uncertainty, lead to systematic errors, filter perceptions, shape assumptions and constrain alternatives.  Cognitive biases are unlikely to be completely eliminated, but research suggests that they may be mitigated by awareness, collaboration, and critical or procedural thinking processes.  <br /><br />Some research has shown that Serious Games (videogames developed for educational, therapeutic, or other serious purposes) can have positive experiential-learning transfer to real world skills or behavior changes. A Serious Game could provide an effective mechanism for exposing and mitigating cognitive bias.<br /><br />The goal of the Sirius Program is to create Serious Games to train participants and measure their proficiency in recognizing and mitigating the cognitive biases that commonly affect all types of intelligence analysis. The research objective is to experimentally manipulate variables in Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) and to determine whether and how such variables might enable player-participant recognition and persistent mitigation of cognitive biases. The Program will provide a basis for experimental repeatability and independent validation of effects, and identify critical elements of design for effective analytic training in VLEs.  The cognitive biases of interest that will be examined include: (1) Confirmation Bias, (2) Fundamental Attribution Error, (3) Bias Blind Spot, (4) Anchoring Bias, (5) Representativeness Bias, and (6) Projection Bias. <br /><br />Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with personnel such as social scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, and gaming and virtual world experts, as appropriate. IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this research. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, academic journals.<br /><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST, February 17, 2011, at the following website: https://conference.brtrc.com/Sirius_pd/Overview.aspx. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed. Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.<br />
<p><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation &amp; Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 12 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>

Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division plans to enter into a three-year un-priced Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Pioneering Evolution, LLC 413 8th Street SE FL 2, Washington DC, 20003-2365.
  It is anticipated that firm-fixed-price and cost-plus-fixed fee job orders will be issued for support of the Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare (PEO LMW) on line PM tool, the NSWC Crane on line PM tool, developing additional system capability, testing, training, business process consulting, and Enterprise Resource Planning, (ERP) consulting.  Terms and conditions will be included in the BOA and job orders will be negotiated on an individual basis. Anticipated BOA requirements will be synopsized on an annual basis.

Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government does not own data rights to the Pioneering Evolution Multi App Framework, and the delay and duplicative cost involved in this follow-on procurement to execute a competitive procurement would not be conducive to the Government meeting delivery and support requirements.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government does not intend to use Part 12 for this acquisition.  Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A formal solicitation will not be issued, however a draft BOA will be prepared.  A copy of the draft BOA will be provided upon request.  Please direct questions to Mr. Dennis G. Smith by e-mail: dennis.g.smith@navy.mil (preferred) or by phone 812-854-3863. Please reference the solicitation number when responding to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Project Description: Construction pre-solicitation for the FY10 Congressional Add MCA PN059978/329828, Analytical Chemistry Wing (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.<BR><BR>Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational. The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials. Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints. Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.<BR><BR>The proposed procurement is unrestricted. NAICS: 236220 with a business size standard of $33.5 million. Estimated cost of services is between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about November 23 2010, to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.  Please note that all Corps of Engineers acquisitions are considered sensitive, but unclassified documents and require users to have valid MPIN entered in the FBO systems to access package.<BR><BR>The media through which the Government chooses to issue this solicitation will be the Internet only.

The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about February 9, 2011 and the Proposal Due Date will be on or about March 11, 2011. The estimated value of this work is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Best Value. NAICS Code: 237990. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement.  The site is located at the BNSF Railroad crossing, immediately east of the Davis Pond Diversion Canal near Ama, La, and north of the two tracks, the existing levee alignment would transition to a floodwall section consisting of sheet pile I-wall, reinforced concrete T-wall, and steel floodgate built to El.+13.5, 13.0, and 15.0 NAVD88, respectively. The total length of floodwall is approximately 150 feet and requires an approximate 60-foot easement for the construction of the railroad floodgate structure. Work included within this project consists of  the following: Steel Swing Gate at BNSF Railroad Crossing, Government-designed temporary falsework, Government-designed temporary retaining structures/temporary flood protection, construction dewatering, concrete reinforced T-Walls, clearing and grubbing, structural excavation and backfill, turf establishment and maintenance, painting, driving steel sheet piling, driving steel h-piles, driving steel pipe piles, and other incidental work.  The railroad gate will require contractors to drive steel H-piling and steel sheet piling, pour base slabs, install false work (temporary bridging consisting of steel pipe piling and structural steel superstructure) for the rail road tracks, construct reinforced concrete floodwall stems, and install steel flood gates in very limited windows of time to facilitate keeping both tracks in service during construction, since this railroad line is reported to be the busiest in the state of Louisiana. The Contractor will be required to provide means to clear railroad ROW quickly should any breakdowns or equipment failures occur (this could mean providing redundant cranes, etc.). Any delays will incur a substantial fine by the railroad company on the construction contractor. As such, a certain level of insurance and bonding capacity will be required as follows: <BR>Contractor, Public and Railroad's Protective Public Liability and Property Damage Liability <BR>  Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability and Physical Damage to Property - $2,000,000 per occurrence. <BR>  Aggregate Limit - $6,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR>  For AMTRAK - Aggregate Limit - $12,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR><BR>Selection will be based on the following criteria, with non-cost factors being more important than price.  Factors 1, 2, and 3 are comparatively equal.  Factor 4 is less significant than factor 1, 2, and 3.  Factor 5 is less significant than factors 1, 2, 3, and 4.  (1) Past Performance Risk which includes Safety (2) Technical Approach and Key Personnel (3) Proposed Construction Duration (4) Small Business Participation Plan (5) Price. Factor 5 will not be scored, but will be subjectively evaluated for reasonableness by the board.   These evaluation factors are subject to change. Any changes to evaluation factors will be shown in the solicitation. The solicitation will include a detailed list of evaluation factors, including any sub-factors or elements, and will provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award. The Government will not provide written paper copies of the solicitation.  Telephone, written, facsimile, or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will not be honored.  Potential Offerors MUST register on FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov/ in order to receive notification(s) and/or change(s) to the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Lacresha Dillon Lacresha.Dillon@usmc.mil
<DESC>The US Marine Corps Logistics Command will be soliciting requests for quotes from business entities in support of annual and preventive maintenance of Uninterruptible Power Supply and Battery  Banks.

Scope:  The LOGCOM C4 Enterprise Support Division plays a vital role in ensuring logistics lines of business applications remain functional and able to meet the demands of the logistics community. These business application and servers are protected from power outages, surges, spikes, and brownouts by a Liebert 500KVA; Model Number: UDA63500A36A255; Part Number: 02-797657-64; Serial number: C253071/29717; and are in the Liebert Battery Cabinet Model:  U36SP500UJBNUUU, BPAJ2F2403600 for Battery FRB2-370.
  Batteries are C&D Technologies MR12-400 (UPS12-370FR) Strings: 3 Batteries per string: 40.  

Should the UPS and Batteries incur severe damage, the result would cause the UPS to be in Bypass Mode which means the datacenter which houses the servers and applications would then be susceptible to power outages, surges, spikes, and brownouts.  If any of these events (power outages, surges, spikes, and brownouts) should occur, server crashes, hardware damage, and lost data would render the entire datacenter useless.  In the event of a UPS down, services and data would not be available to our customers, and many hours of rework would be required to rebuild the services.

Items to be maintained:

UPS: Liebert 500KVA; Model Number: UDA63500A36A255; Part Number: 02-797657-64; and Serial number: C253071/29717.
 Full service, 2 Preventive Maintenance (PM)  4 Hour Response.  24/7 technical support (365 days per year).  Contractor shall cover all parts, labor, travel and onsite time.

Batteries:  C&D Technologies MR12-400 (UPS12-370FR) Strings: 3 Batteries per string: 40.  Contractor shall `provide preventive maintenance as outlined.  The batteries are in three (3) Liebert Battery Cabinet Model numbers U36SP500UJBNUUU, BPAJ2F2403600 for Battery FRB2-370.  

Solicitation M67004-11-Q-0082 will be issued to support the requirement.   This initiative will fall under FAR Part 13 procedures. 

The Solicitation will be issued as Full & Open competition with the resultant purchase order being a Firm Fixed Price order for a 1 year base period and 4 one-year options.
  The solicitation will be issued approximately 9 February 2011 via NECO.

All work will be performed at Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, GA.

<DESC>The US ARMY ARDEC, Small Arms Technology Branch, Picatinny, NJ is conducting
a market survey to identify potential sources for a Mirage Mitigation Device 
(MMD).  The device is required to wrap around the suppressor of the M110 Semi-
Automatic Sniper System (SASS) and XM2010 (M24 upgrade) weapon systems. The 
device shall mitigate suppressor heat mirage effects that reduce the snipers 
ability to accurately resolve the target and wind speeds/direction down range. 
The device shall reduce the suppressors thermal signature. The device shall 
permit sniper suppressor handling and rapid egress minimizing bodily injury 
and burn damage to clothing and carrying packs. The device must survive in 
operational military environments in accordance with MIL-STD-810. The device 
must be a Non Developmental Item (NDI) or a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) 
item. Primary interest is in a device designed for use with no modification to 
the weapons configuration including the suppressor. However, information for 
products that require minimal modification may also be provided. The MMD shall 
not cause damage to the sniper weapon system or suppressor due to overheating 
or melting of the material.

Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing 
specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other 
technical data as well as identification of current customers and rough 
indication of pricing. Any pricing data should be sent, if available and at no 
cost to the US Government.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <BR><BR>3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data. <BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS" <BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <BR><BR>6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "CONFIDENTIAL" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR>

<DESC>Introduction: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small businesses; or small business disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, $7.0M.<br />Background: The Radiation Studies Branch (RSB) is located in the Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects (EHHE), National Center for Envorinmental Health (NCEH) within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp; (CDC)under Health and Human Services (HHS). The roles and responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a nuclear/radiological emergency are described in the National Response Framework (NRF), Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an Operating Division of HHS with responsibilities for response to disasters involving nuclear/radiological incidents. Additionally, CDC's RSB, has the specific responsibility for research related to radiation exposures to members of the general public.

<DESC>Yellowstone National Park is issuing a Sources Sought notice for a potential name brand purchase.
Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use:The Grand Teton/Yellowstone Natural Soundscape Program uses automated sound monitoring instruments for year-round data collection. Since the program's 2003 beginning, the central component of these systems has been Larson Davis (LD) 824 that are being replaced by LD 831 sound level meters. The Grand Teton/Yellowstone Soundscape Program currently has six LD 824s and six LD 831s. 
Larson Davis developed a substantially improved sound level meter (LD 831) that will advance and improve the Soundscape Program's data collection efforts. The 831 meter uses substantially less power that results in fewer batteries and solar panels to power the systems. The 831 meter collects sound levels AND digital recordings that will replace the need for a laptop computer in the system substantially reducing system costs and power requirements while improving the recording quality. The integrated functions will allow more rapid and less conspicuous deployment and in areas farther from easily accessible locations (e.g., backcountry sites). 
Items to be purchased are:LD831-FF Larson Davis 831 Sound Level Meter Kit with FFPP 50mV Microphone831-OB3 Firmware, 1/1, 1/3 Octavev Bank Frequency831-LOG Firmware, Interval Logging, 20 mS to 4 hoursLD CBL 170 CableLD EXC 010 Microphone Extension CableWS-005-F Foam Widescrens Microphone
Name Brand Request Rationale:
Existing software compatibility:The NPS has developed specialize software to process data from both the original LD 824 sound level meter and the LD 831 model. All sound level meters have unique formatting and data storage requirements. These essential NPS-developed software programs will not work with other manufacturers' sound level meters and are necessary for data analysis and reporting. 
Hardware and accessories:The LD 831 sound level meter (SLM) uses numerous accessories (environmental shroud, microphones, preamplifiers, cables, power supply) that are interchangeable with both the LD 824 and LD 831 models currently in use at Grand Teton/Yellowstone. This makes the integration of an additional LD 831 simple and cost effective.
The 831 sound level meter is an important component of our soundscape program and the instrument that will eventually replace all LD 824 sound level meters in the program.
If you are a vendor who feels your product is competitive with this Larson Davis product or if you are a Larson Davis distributor instrested in the request please email Andrea_Brew@nps.gov.

<DESC>Scope of Work
For the Energy Project, 629-11-102

Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS) personnel have recently reviewed energy usage and cost at the New Orleans, 1601 Perdido Street site, for calendar years 2008 and 2009.  Specifically we looked at the cooling chilled water purchased from Entergy Thermal and the self generated low pressure steam system.  We have concluded that there are several opportunities for improvement in these systems.

The objective of this Scope of Work is to select a qualified contractor to design and implement changes in the HVAC systems that will result in a substantial reduction in annual electricity and chilled water usages and cost.  The focus of the project will be to attain these reductions through replacement of the existing electric low pressure steam boiler with a natural gas fired boiler and reduction of chilled water usage and make-up water usage through improved monitoring and management of chilled water distribution and to minimize leakage.

The contractor selected to perform the work on this project must be familiar with the types of HVAC Systems currently in operation at the facility in New Orleans and must have direct hands-on experience with the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of like systems in use at the facility.  Further, the contractor must have permanent local technical support/maintenance personnel available.  

The Project will include the following four (4) parts identified as necessary to accomplish the desired HVAC improvements.  The Task list for each project is not intended to be comprehensive or complete.  It will be the responsibility of the selected contractor to perform all of the itemized tasks as well as any additional tasks that are necessary to successfully implement each part of the project and to develop a phasing schedule to minimize impact on patient care.

Project Part C - Design and install a redundant chilled water booster pump system for the G & H buildings.

Tasks

1.	Design a redundant chilled water booster pumping system for the G & H buildings.  The system shall consist of three parallel pumps each equipped with check valves, isolation valves and variable frequency drives (VFDs).  One pump shall be the primary pump for building G, one will be the primary for building H and the third pump shall be valved in a manner such that it can serve as a backup for either buildings primary pump.  Pumps shall be selected to provide design flow to operate existing HVAC equipment as well as design flow for equipment changes anticipated over the next 10 years.  The VFDs will be controlled by the BAS which will modulate the speed to maintain design differential pressure at the highest delivery point in each building.  

2.	 Demolish and dispose of the existing pumps and equipment to be replaced.

3.	Install the new pumps and equipment including all necessary valves, strainers, air separators, piping and insulation.

If the unavailability of key personnel is not the fault of the supplier, the contracting officer may terminate by giving notice of termination. The supplier will be paid for service performed up to the date of termination. If the contracting officer finds that the supplier is at fault for the unavailability of key personnel, the agreement may be terminated for default.

<DESC>TITLE: Geospatial (GEOINT) Intelligence Material Solutions Technology Search
<p>DESCRIPTION: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Requirements and Capabilities Integration Directorate (XR) is conducting market research to identify and examine technologies and potential system solutions available to provide airborne GEOINT capabilities to the USAF in the near- and mid-term (current and next Fiscal Year Defense Plans). These capabilities are for use by USAF forces employed during both Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO's) and Global Strike (GS) operations. This Capability Request For Information (CRFI) will support requirements generation and refinement, Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) document development, and potential inputs to both the Air Combat Command (ACC) Program Objective Memorandum process and the USAF Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Flight Plan.</p>
<p>This request for information is for planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. However, estimates may be used, not attributed to a particular Respondent, as a basis to engage with appropriate USAF organizations to inform and solicit programmatic support. Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.<br /><br />Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive". Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it may be used to assist in developing programming inputs and acquisition strategies for future USAF directed acquisition programs. It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services support contractor personnel. All members of the government/contractor team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.</p>
<p>APPROACH: This CRFI is being issued to identify and examine technologies and potential system solutions available to provide airborne GEOINT capabilities to the USAF in the near- and/or mid-term (current and next Fiscal Year Defense Plans). These capabilities are for use by USAF forces employed during operations in a wide range of environmental conditions (see items requested for inclusion in white paper, 3 paragraphs below). USAF is interested in GEOINT material solution concepts for potential fielding on both manned and unmanned aircraft that are applicable to the following generic areas:</p>
<p>- Find/Detect, Fix, Target, and Track Improvised Explosive Devices</p>
<p>- Find/Detect, Fix, Target, and Track individuals within densely populated and rural areas</p>
<p>- Identify individuals within densely populated and rural areas</p>
<p>- Find/Detect, Fix, Target, and Track targets employing concealment, camouflage, and deception countermeasures</p>
<p>- Characterize targets employing concealment, camouflage, and deception countermeasures</p>
<p>- Find/Detect, Fix, Target, and Track targets in anti-access, area denial environments</p>
<p>- Persistent collection capabilities in support of national strategies</p>
<p>- Long range detection and characterization of multispectral targets</p>
<p>- Detection and characterization of small gas powered generators in a wide range of environmental conditions</p>
<p>Respondents are encouraged to provide responses that are applicable to individual or multiples of the above listed focus areas. It is left to the respondents' discretion whether to provide a response involving existing (fielded or "ready" to field), new (in development or conceptual), or a combination of each. The goal of this CRFI is to identify new or existing technology concepts that can address emerging operational needs and provide the desired capability and capacity. Wherever possible and practical, the utilization of open, digital, modular, scalable, sustainable and common architectures is encouraged to enable such technology to be used on multiple aircraft types and with multiple system interfaces.</p>
<p>The capability needs to be addressed by this CRFI are in some cases challenging. The Air Force is looking to industry to identify solution concepts that address the full range of these in an incremental manner. Therefore, companies that have partial solution concepts are encouraged to respond and address the extent to which their concepts provide answers to the challenges presented by this CRFI. This feedback provides the Air Force with insights into what is readily available and what the Technology Readiness Levels are for concepts which can meet these challenges. It also provides an indication of what operational needs are most susceptible to costs and technical performance factors.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to complete the GEOINT Call For Concepts template posted on this site. Additionally, a white paper to amplify the data on the slide is requested. The information provided between these two documents should include the following:<br />- Concept title<br />- Name of the prime contractor and any sub-contractors<br />- TRL level of the concept as of 1 Feb 11and funded plans to mature technology to higher level<br />- Size, Weight, and Power requirements of the concept<br />- List of which USAF platforms could potentially host the concept<br />- Description of the concepts technology<br />- Description of the operational capabilities delivered by the concept<br />- Description of any unique operational considerations needed to enable the concept on USAF aircraft<br />- Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate, or actual costs if known, for the following elements:<br />-- R&amp;D<br />-- Average Unit Cost (production) for an estimated range between 15 and 75 units <br />-- Annual Support Costs for both the concept and, if required, impacts to the PED system with recommended changes (if known)<br />- List of current users (organization and POC contact information) if the concept is already fielded<br />- Top level schedule to "first unit" production<br />- Concept graphic or OV-1 (preferred)<br />- Estimation of platform integration complexity to dependencies and include impacts to existing comm and data links<br />- Estimation of impacts to a host platforms configuration to include Group A impacts/requirements. Group A refers to parts or components (including software) that are permanently or temporarily installed into an aircraft to support, secure, interconnect, or accommodate modified onboard avionics, and/or a pod.<br />- For concepts that may rely on fusion or integration of data, address organizational, architectural and system standards issues required to implement the concept.<br />- Associated Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) near real time and Forensics requirements, to include characteristics required of:<br />-- Connectivity/compatibility with Distributed Ground Station (DGS)/Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS)<br />-- Data storage and/or storage networks<br />-- Exploitation support to include<br />--- Tools/algorithms<br />--- Required training<br />--- Number of analysts<br />-- Dissemination (data links, SATCOM, etc) needed to pass collected data to the ground processing systems <br />- Estimation of system performance in the following environments (OCO and GS Missions):<br />-- Urban environment<br />-- Rural environment<br />-- Mountainous terrain<br />-- Flat terrain<br />-- Night operations<br />-- Poor weather conditions</p>

Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. The purpose of this survey is to gather market information from manufacturers of critical go-to-war items that can offer insights to production constraints that have limited industry's ability to meet demand spikes associated with wartime or contingency operations. The Warstopper Program seeks this information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to industrial capacity issues for go-to-war items.</p>
<p>Questions of consideration:</p>
<p>A. Can you identify critical components, sub-components or raw materials that have limited your ability to meet surges in demand associated with contingency operations? If known, please provide sub-tier supplier information if the components identified are provided from a supply chain partner.</p>
<p>B. Are there technological improvements or automation that can be implemented at your facility that would significantly improve your capability to meet spikes in demand or provide a reduction in PLT? If so, please provide a short summary of the potential improvements and estimated increase in production capability or decrease in PLT.</p>
<p>C. Please provide a list of DLA items you are approved to produce and indicate if you currently have a contract with DLA?</p>

Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. The purpose of this survey is to gather market information from manufacturers of critical go-to-war items that can offer insights to production constraints that have limited industry's ability to meet demand spikes associated with wartime or contingency operations. The Warstopper Program seeks this information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to industrial capacity issues for go-to-war items.</p>
<p>Questions of consideration:</p>
<p>A. Can you identify critical components, sub-components or raw materials that have limited your ability to meet surges in demand associated with contingency operations? If known, please provide sub-tier supplier information if the components identified are provided from a supply chain partner.</p>
<p>B. Are there technological improvements or automation that can be implemented at your facility that would significantly improve your capability to meet spikes in demand or provide a reduction in PLT? If so, please provide a short summary of the potential improvements and estimated increase in production capability or decrease in PLT.</p>
<p>C. Please provide a list of DLA items you are approved to produce and indicate if you currently have a contract with DLA?</p>

<p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. The purpose of this survey is to gather market information from manufacturers of critical go-to-war items that can offer insights to production constraints that have limited industry's ability to meet demand spikes associated with wartime or contingency operations. The Warstopper Program seeks this information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to industrial capacity issues for go-to-war items.</p>
<p>Questions of consideration:</p>
<p>A. Can you identify critical components, sub-components or raw materials that have limited your ability to meet surges in demand associated with contingency operations? If known, please provide sub-tier supplier information if the components identified are provided from a supply chain partner.</p>
<p>B. Are there technological improvements or automation that can be implemented at your facility that would significantly improve your capability to meet spikes in demand or provide a reduction in PLT? If so, please provide a short summary of the potential improvements and estimated increase in production capability or decrease in PLT.</p>
<p>C. Please provide a list of DLA items you are approved to produce and indicate if you currently have a contract with DLA?</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>
<p><br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>
<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper. The font for text should be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Responses must be unclassified.</p>
<p>5. Request for Clarification<br />A responder may request clarification, in writing, from the Contracting Officer for any requirement that is unclear, by sending an e-mail to melissa.spishak@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this RFI in order to receive a timely response.</p>
<p>6. Submission of Documentation<br />Responses to this RFI are due to the contracting office identified below by 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, 28 February 2011. Responders shall provide one (1) electronic copy and one (1) paper copy of their response. All electronic file content must match the print versions of the submitted documents.

<p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. The purpose of this survey is to gather market information from manufacturers of critical go-to-war items that can offer insights to production constraints that have limited industry's ability to meet demand spikes associated with wartime or contingency operations. The Warstopper Program seeks this information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to industrial capacity issues for go-to-war items.</p>
<p>Questions of consideration:</p>
<p>A. Can you identify critical components, sub-components or raw materials that have limited your ability to meet surges in demand associated with contingency operations? If known, please provide sub-tier supplier information if the components identified are provided from a supply chain partner.</p>
<p>B. Are there technological improvements or automation that can be implemented at your facility that would significantly improve your capability to meet spikes in demand or provide a reduction in PLT? If so, please provide a short summary of the potential improvements and estimated increase in production capability or decrease in PLT.</p>
<p>C. Please provide a list of DLA items you are approved to produce and indicate if you currently have a contract with DLA?</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>

<p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. The purpose of this survey is to gather market information from manufacturers of critical go-to-war items that can offer insights to production constraints that have limited industry's ability to meet demand spikes associated with wartime or contingency operations. The Warstopper Program seeks this information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to industrial capacity issues for go-to-war items.</p>
<p>Questions of consideration:</p>
<p>A. Can you identify critical components, sub-components or raw materials that have limited your ability to meet surges in demand associated with contingency operations? If known, please provide sub-tier supplier information if the components identified are provided from a supply chain partner.</p>
<p>B. Are there technological improvements or automation that can be implemented at your facility that would significantly improve your capability to meet spikes in demand or provide a reduction in PLT? If so, please provide a short summary of the potential improvements and estimated increase in production capability or decrease in PLT.</p>
<p>C. Please provide a list of DLA items you are approved to produce and indicate if you currently have a contract with DLA?</p>

TELONICS INC932 E IMPALA AVEMESA AZ 85204-6699
FOR :	Argos Equipped GPS Radio-Collars (Wolf Study) required for the collection of location data and monitoring of wolves on the Alaska Peninsual and Becharof National Wildlife Refuge to meet current study objectives. These collars are needed for deployment during February - March in order to meet study objectives. Estimated cost for 10 Argos equipped GPS radio-collars including shipping is $28,230.00.

NAICS:	334220	Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing
AUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
Determination not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:Telonics Inc GPS radio-collars are currently deployed on wolves on the the Alaska Peninsula. The purchase of TGW-4580H collars from Telonics Inc will facilitate use of currently owned (i.e. previously purchased) and operated data download systems.  Data download systems currently being used are set up for TGW-4580H collars and use of other sources would necessitate the redevelopment of data download contracts, re-development of ARGOS use system agreeements and currently deployed, us of Telonics Inc collars would also maintain consistency in data collections, an extremely important component of wildlife studies and facilitates comparsions of data.  No other vendor can provide the required TGW-4580H collars which meet these requirements. In addition Telonics Inc is the only source found that uses a completely encased transmitter design which has proven to be more durable for carnivores than other designs (i.e. separated transmitter casing which is not molded to the collar).

<DESC>The Robley Rex VA Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky intends to award a sole source contract to Fleet Services & Installation to provide construction services to reconfigure the chilled water distribution system on the medical center campus.  The intent of the project is to obtain energy efficiency through the replacement of the existing primary-secondary system with a variable flow means.  Work includes adding controls, motors, variable speed drives, and pumps as necessary, to implement a variable flow model.

This is a sole source procurement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)-Other than Full and Open Competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-2.  This Special Notice is NOT  a request for competitive quotes, as the urgency of completing this work is emminent as the cooling season is fastly approaching, thus this requirement presents an Unusual and Compelling Urgency to the government.  A delay in award could result in serious injury to the medical center.

NAICS code 238220 is applicable to this solicitation and the business size standard is $14M.

The VA anticipates this requirement will be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.

<DESC>This request is for market research and informational purposes only. The government does not intend to award a contract as a result of this announcement.
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the Department of State has a broad range of criminal justice and rule of law responsibilities. INL will have Criminal Justice Program Support (CJPS) projects addressing police, justice, corrections, and other aspects of a host country's criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The INL Worldwide Protective Services (IWPS) will require personal protective services, static security and emergency response services for designated personnel and facilities for some CJPS projects. These security services are the responsibility of IWPS Contractors.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) describes the Government's approach for the IWPS acquisition and expands the opportunities for wider industry participation. The Government also expresses its interest in the participation in the solicitation process, either directly or as subcontractors, of smaller organizations with specialized capabilities and experience in various criminal justice disciplines. The purpose of this RFI is twofold: 1) Provide information to industry explaining the Government's IWPS acquisition approach; 2) Solicit comments from industry which address: acquisition approach, extent to which industry can meet the Government's requirements, contracting approach, staffing, field support, program management, etc. Where responders differ with the Government's current approach as presented in this RFI, we specifically request suggested alternatives and comments that would be equally effective in meeting the Government's objectives. This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in addressing any and all sections of the RFI and to provide suggestions for alternative approaches and solutions. Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and impacting the content of the RFP. Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided Section L of the attachment package.</p>

<DESC>The VA NW Health Network (VISN20) intends to negotiate a single source procurement for commercial PACS services in accordance with FAR Part 13 with BRIT Systems. AGFA cPACS is currently being installed throughout the Network. The Network needs an addition month of services from the incumbent contractor, BRIT Systems to maintain critical PACS services during the installation phase of the new system. BRIT Systems is the sole manufacturer and distributor of its products and services and all of BRIT Systems applications are proprietary. No other company can provide these products or support for these products.  Due to the fact BRIT Systems retains ownership of each system and software license, they are responsible for licensing and supporting this equipment.  No other party can provide license renewal or maintenance services on any of the BRIT equipment.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone inquiries will not be honored; however, interested parties may submit literature detailing how their services meet the VA requirements to the Contractor.  Responses received on or before February 01, 2011 will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p><strong>PROPOSALS DUE: 9 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST)</strong></p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price <br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition:<br />52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Aside, Alternate I<br />52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Representation <br />52.222-3, Convict Labor <br />52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies <br />52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities <br />52.222-26, Equal Opportunity <br />52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities <br />52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases <br />52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price<br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</strong> <br />This is a competitive best value evaluation in which the competing offerors will be ranked by price and then determined technically acceptable (LPTA). Certifications and past performance experience will be evaluated in order to determine if the offeror is technically "acceptable". By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Unless explicitly noted in the proposal, all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br /><strong>A. Price Evaluation.</strong> Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in attachment 5 by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The price evaluation will document (for the offers evaluated under paragraph B below) <br />the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.<br /><br /><strong>B. Technical Acceptability.</strong> Only the five (5) lowest price offeror's past performance information will be analyzed. This solicitation does not require the submission of a separate technical proposal however; maintenance on the digital secured trunking system located on Barksdale AFB must be performed by a factory trained Motorola technician using only genuine Motorola replacement parts in accordance with the warranty. In order to determine technical acceptability, training certificates are required to be included with past performance information. <br /><br /><strong>(1)Certificates</strong> must indicate training on a Motorola Astro 7.4 Digital Secured Trunking System or higher. Certificates should be submitted for the person who will be performing the actual maintenance. <br /><br /><strong>(2) Past performance</strong> The five (5) lowest price offerors will be evaluated based on (1) their past performance information submittals and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment as "Go/No Go". The evaluation of the five (5) lowest price offers past performance until an offeror is rated "Go" or until all offerors are evaluated. While the Government evaluation team and the contracting officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. <br /><br />Relevant past performance includes, but is not limited to, digital trunking system maintenance experience. Recent past performance consists of contracts, completed or in progress, performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years from date of issuance of this solicitation. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />Past performance regarding joint ventures, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major requirements or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "No Go," meaning the rating is treated unfavorably. <br />Past performance data required is: contract number, contract performance period, contract award amount, brief description of effort, and government or private issuing activity point of contract/telephone number. <br /><br />C. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><strong>SITE VISIT INFORMATION<br /></strong>A site visit will be held on <strong>Thursday, February 2, 2011 at 10:00 am</strong>. Attendees are requested to arrive at the Contractor's Gate (East Gate), located on Industrial Loop, no later than 12:45 pm to be signed onto base. A guided tour will be given to show the prospective offerors the sites where work is to be performed. This is the only time a site visit will be arranged.<br /><br /><strong>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT INCOMPLETE PROPOSALS.</strong> Offers will be evaluated on the prices as offered. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offer cannot comply with every requirement, then the offer will not be rated as technically acceptable, and therefore will not be considered. Once an offer with the lowest price has been determined to be technically acceptable, and in compliance with all directions in this solicitation, the Government will award to the offeror.<br /><br />Proposals can be faxed (in accordance with FAR provision 52.214-13 TELEGRAPHIC BIDS) to the attention of A1C Jeffery Hairston at (318) 456-2107 <strong>no later than 9 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST).</strong> Offers received after this date and time will be considered as late submissions in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated or considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation # W906T0343N008 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 29 January-30 May 2011 in the Southport, NC area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. <BR>Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5 M to $30 M.  All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.<BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>The Offeror shall follow the format and instructions below in preparing its proposal.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To facilitate proposal evaluation, the offeror shall submit three (3) copies of their Price Proposal as Volume I and three (3) copies of their Technical proposal as Volume II. These volumes must be clearly marked as "Price Proposal" (Volume I) and "Technical Proposal" (Volume II). <br />As follows:</p>
<p>Volume I- PRICE PRPOSAL - 3 Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume I) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in the Pricing Section of the Solicitation, and their proposed dollar amounts. The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred.</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractor's technical proposal.</p>
<p>Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions. Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Volume II - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL/ PLAN - Two (2) Copies</p>
<p>The overall contents of the Technical Proposal (Volume II) shall be submitted in the following stated distinct tabs.</p>
<p>TAB (A) - COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE- The offeror shall submit all pertinent information with a minimum of one (1) contract they performed, within the last five years, with a total of 2 or more buildings per contract.

For the contract, the offeror shall provide the customer's name, address, name of the contracting official and his/her telephone number. The offeror shall state what the period of performance of the contract was/is.</p>
<p>TAB (B) - PAST PERFORMANCE- The offeror will be evaluated on their performance, and that of significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, under existing or prior contracts for services.

<p>The offeror will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services. Prior experience beyond five (5) years will not be considered. Performance information collected through references will be used for both responsibility determination and for the evaluation of past performance. The Government may contact references other than those identified by the Offeror and the information received may be used to evaluate the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>TAB (C) - PLAN OF OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE- Tab "C" shall set forth the functions, responsibilities, qualifications, and authorities of the offeror's management personnel. The offeror shall provide a complete, clear, and concise organizational chart which delineates the role and responsibility of corporate management as it will pertain to the successful performance of the resulting contract.</p>
<p>The offeror shall submit a Plan of Operation containing the proposed levels of staffing, showing numbers and types of personnel. The Plan shall provide methods and procedures that will be utilized to accomplish all required services under the solicitation, and which will ensure that all start-up, training, and qualification requirements will be accomplished both before the commencement date for services and satisfactorily maintained during the term of the contract. The offeror shall provide details on how personnel will be brought on-site without interruption starting with the first day of the contract.</p>
<p>TAB (D) - PHASE IN/ OUT PLAN - The offeror shall submit a brief phase-in/ phase-out plan detailing the actions that will be taken to interface if there is a successor Contractor to ensure the continuation and continuity of all services without any interruption in the event the offeror is not awarded a follow on contract.</p>

<p>TAB (F) - QUALITY CONTROL PLAN The offeror shall submit a preliminary Quality Control Plan which demonstrates a clear and distinct understanding and appreciation of the need for quality control, and it's direct relationship to, and effect upon, all requirements covered within the Solicitation. Written inspection forms, reports, format to be used (provide samples) and an explanation of how and to whom they would be distributed, as well as who will be performing QA functions.</p>
<p>To be considered for award, the offeror's proposal must provide sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation by the DOS Evaluation Panel.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates awarding one (1) IDIQ contract under this RFP to the responsive and responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements of the solicitation and whose offer is considered to be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offeror.</p>

<p>Note: Award of this contract may be made based on the initial quotation/proposal and without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, <br />with the exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and <br />weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un- <br />acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable<br />representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated <br />as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull; OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the <br />Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,<br />the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.<br />&bull; GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in <br />achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, <br />sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some <br />weaknesses.<br />&bull; ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to<br />moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there <br />are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial <br />and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.<br />&bull; UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate<br />To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. <br />An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, <br />or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. <br />The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.<br />&bull; NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.<br />* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL<br />rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Price<br />2. Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the products meet the minimum standards and are in compliance with the grade of the products specified, based on product literature/description (i.e., products brochures and/or products catalog data).<br />All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>

The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and elmiminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation. If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a)2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.) <br />(d)(1) If the Contractor in the previous tax year had gross income, from all sources, under $300,000, the Contractor is exempt from the requirement to report subcontractor awards. <br />(2) If a subcontractor in the previous tax year had gross income from all sources under $300,000, the Contractor does not need to report awards to that subcontractor. <br />(e) Phase-in of reporting of subcontracts of $25,000 or more. <br />(1) Until September 30, 2010, any newly awarded subcontract must be reported if the prime contract award amount was $20,000,000 or more. <br />(2) From October 1, 2010, until February 28, 2011, any newly awarded subcontract must be reported if the prime contract award amount was $550,000 or more. <br />(3) Starting March 1, 2011, any newly awarded subcontract must be reported if the prime contract award amount was $25,000 or more. <br />(End of clause)</p>

     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.
 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin
 
	
	
	
	
	
 
     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]
 
     [ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.
 
     [ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
 
   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
 
       (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
 
     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
 
     (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.
 
       [  ] TIN is not required because:

A foreign entity that is treated as an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. 7874 (or would be except that the inversion transactions were completed on or before March 4, 2003), is also an inverted domestic corporation for purposes of 6 U.S.C. 395 and for this solicitation provision (see FAR 9.108).
 
     (2) Representation. By submission of its offer, the offeror represents that it is not an inverted domestic corporation and is not a subsidiary of one.

       (ii) The offeror has certified that all the offered products to be supplied are designated country end products.

 Statement of Work

1.  Occupationally exposed health care professionals are provided with film-badge and/or quarterly monitoring by solid state thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD).  Monthly evaluation of occupationally absorbed dose is calibrated in millirems or millijoules of energy per kilogram of tissue.
2.  The approved vendor must be an approved member of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
3.  Potential vendors, for dosimetry services shall not require on-line management of their dosimetry account that would require the exchange of hundreds of names, dates of birth, and social security numbers (fax & mail).
4.  Otherwise, Information Security Officer(ISO)and Information Resource Management IRM) must concur with any installation of vendor provided proprietary software to manage their dosimetry account and provide this Office with training appropriate to the on-line management of the vendors dosimetry account.  In addition, the Information Security Officer (ISO) must concur with any exchange of routine personal data: names, dates of birth, and social security numbers.  
Constant coordination with IRM and the ISO may severely reduce the timeliness of the radiation safety dosimetry program. 
5.  Monitoring fourteen Services for occupationally exposure to ionizing radiation from gamma radiation, neutron fluence rate, and x-rays is a requirement of our VHA-NHPP Permit; the VHA Master Material License; the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Title 10 Code of Regulation, Part 19; and U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.1096.
6.  Use of a range of between 356 and 391 monthly film-badge monitoring insures that approved personnel do not exceed a quarterly or annual limit of absorbed dose as prescribed by law.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
          (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
        (ii) Examples.
          (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
          (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
          (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
          (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
      (1) Listed end products. 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin
 
     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-- 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
      (2) __ Outside the United States. 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
      [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-- 
       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
        (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
      (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
        (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p><strong>PROPOSALS DUE: 9 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST)</strong></p>
<p>Offerors must comply with all instructions contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and the following addenda applies. Offerors shall submit their proposal on letterhead stationery; provide unit prices with a grand total. ORCA or Representations and Certifications will be required.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price <br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition:<br />52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Aside, Alternate I<br />52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Representation <br />52.222-3, Convict Labor <br />52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies <br />52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities <br />52.222-26, Equal Opportunity <br />52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities <br />52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases <br />52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price<br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</strong> <br />This is a competitive best value evaluation in which the competing offerors will be ranked by price and then determined technically acceptable (LPTA). Certifications and past performance experience will be evaluated in order to determine if the offeror is technically "acceptable". By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Unless explicitly noted in the proposal, all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br /><strong>A. Price Evaluation.</strong> Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in attachment 5 by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The price evaluation will document (for the offers evaluated under paragraph B below) <br />the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.<br /><br /><strong>B. Technical Acceptability.</strong> Only the five (5) lowest price offeror's past performance information will be analyzed. This solicitation does not require the submission of a separate technical proposal however; maintenance on the digital secured trunking system located on Barksdale AFB must be performed by a factory trained Motorola technician using only genuine Motorola replacement parts in accordance with the warranty. In order to determine technical acceptability, training certificates are required to be included with past performance information. <br /><br /><strong>(1)Certificates</strong> must indicate training on a Motorola Astro 7.4 Digital Secured Trunking System or higher. Certificates should be submitted for the person who will be performing the actual maintenance. <br /><br /><strong>(2) Past performance</strong> The five (5) lowest price offerors will be evaluated based on (1) their past performance information submittals and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment as "Go/No Go". The evaluation of the five (5) lowest price offers past performance until an offeror is rated "Go" or until all offerors are evaluated. While the Government evaluation team and the contracting officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. <br /><br />Relevant past performance includes, but is not limited to, digital trunking system maintenance experience. Recent past performance consists of contracts, completed or in progress, performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years from date of issuance of this solicitation. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />Past performance regarding joint ventures, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major requirements or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "No Go," meaning the rating is treated unfavorably. <br />Past performance data required is: contract number, contract performance period, contract award amount, brief description of effort, and government or private issuing activity point of contract/telephone number. <br /><br />C. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><strong>SITE VISIT INFORMATION<br /></strong>A site visit will be held on <strong>Thursday, February 2, 2011 at 10:00 am</strong>. Attendees are requested to arrive at the Contractor's Gate (East Gate), located on Industrial Loop, <strong>no later than 9:45 am</strong> to be signed onto base. A guided tour will be given to show the prospective offerors the sites where work is to be performed. This is the only time a site visit will be arranged.<br /><br /><strong>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT INCOMPLETE PROPOSALS.</strong> Offers will be evaluated on the prices as offered. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offer cannot comply with every requirement, then the offer will not be rated as technically acceptable, and therefore will not be considered. Once an offer with the lowest price has been determined to be technically acceptable, and in compliance with all directions in this solicitation, the Government will award to the offeror.<br /><br />Proposals can be faxed (in accordance with FAR provision 52.214-13 TELEGRAPHIC BIDS) to the attention of A1C Jeffery Hairston at (318) 456-2107 <strong>no later than 9 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST).</strong> Offers received after this date and time will be considered as late submissions in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated or considered.

<p>The Maritime Administration (Marad) is considering alternatives for the repair, retrofit, or replacement of the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet (SBRF) Facility Barge, formerly an ex-U.S. Navy Auxiliary Personnel Lighter (APL).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SBRF is part of Marad's National Defense Reserve Fleet located in Benicia, CA, and maintains a group of laid up ex-commercial, U. S. Navy and U. S. Coast Guard ships moored in Suisun Bay for potential re-use or ultimate disposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The APL provides for a base of operations, including:</p>
<p>Office space, Office support and storage areas, Meeting rooms, Restroom facilities, Employee break and change rooms, Maintenance shops, Industrial equipment store room, Spare parts storage, Hazardous material storage, Document archive, Mooring for fleet service craft</p>
<p>The APL<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is in need of drydocking and repair, some extensive steel work at the waterline, and complete exterior recoating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the electrical distribution system is antiquated and is a potential fire hazard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also desirable to make the facility more energy efficient, and employ means of renewable energy for electrical power, heating and cooling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In discussions amongst Marad personnel regarding these requirements, alternatives have been suggested to replace the vessel with another floating facility or a building constructed atop or adjacent to the access pier.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This announcement serves as both a notice to offerors and as the solicitation. Responses (Quotes) should be developed based upon this announcement since a formal solicitation (Request for Quotations) will not be issued. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. The NAICS Code is 511210. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with OpenText, Inc., 275 Frank Tompa Drive, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L-OA1, for a renewal of its Hummingbird BIQuery software license and support for an 11-month Base Period of 02-01-11 through 12-31-11 with two successive 12-month Option Periods. The Hummingbird BIQuery enterprise content management (ECM) software was initially acquired by NIH in 1995 as the primary reporting tool for the NIH Data Warehouse, an enterprise-wide system that brings all of NIH's administrative data and reporting requirements together in one place. The NIH Data Warehouse was initially developed as a data repository using the DB2 database system on an IBM main-frame. By 1995, managers were able to use a Windows-based graphical user interface to query the data repository in such subject areas as budget and finance, personnel, procurement, property, travel, and research grants. In 1996, due to the increasing popularity of the data repository and the requirement to increase its functionality to support NIH's heterogeneous legacy systems, NIH migrated the data in the data repository into an enterprise-wide data warehouse. The data warehouse provides management with timely, accurate business intelligence on NIH's funding, suppliers, inventories, research activities and facilities, and other areas important to NIH and its constituents. The data warehouse transforms data from disparate sources into cohesive, consistent information and provides desktop access to this information. It is optimized for answering both current and historical business questions with easy extraction of data from the central data warehouse for report generation, exportation into data marts, or downloading into desktop spreadsheets. NIH managers can run predefined queries and reports and can develop ad hoc queries and reports on administrative and scientific functions. The functions in the NIH Data Warehouse are currently grouped into the following business areas: Budget and Finance, Department of Health and Human Services Contract Information System (DCIS) Reporting, Government Purchase Card, Human Resources, Procurements and Market Requisitions, Property (Historical), Research Contracts and Grants, Staff Training, and NIH Executive Reporting. The legacy NIH Data Warehouse enterprise system is currently undergoing a migration to the latest "best practice" technologies under the new NIH nVision Data Warehouse, including the legacy reporting tool. NIH will gradually migrate the legacy business areas, including the critical Budget and Finance components, in the legacy Data Warehouse until such time that the NIH New Business System (NBS) and the new NIH nVision Data Warehouse can reach a state of stabilization. Hummingbird BIQuery is the only ECM software available in the marketplace that can successfully fulfill NIH's requirement for a reporting tool application during the migration. CIT has therefore determined that it would be impossible to convert to a new software reporting tool at this point during the migration process. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software product and support specifications which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the NIH Data Warehouse ECM reporting tool requirements. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror's Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact by 4PM 1/31/2011 . NLM Synopsis No. NLM-11-053-DAH shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: hurgeda@mail.nih.gov .

As stated in the RFQ, contractor will be responsible for including any and all costs in their quote necessary for completing the display in accordance with law, including but not limited to costs related to obtaining any necessary local, state, and federal permits and the cost of the barge needed for the display. The Government will provide reasonable assistance to contractor to expedite, as necessary, any permit requests. 
2. Contractor will coordinate with designated National Park Service contracts during the performance of the display to generally coordinate the fireworks with National Park Service provided music. For instance, the display should generally begin when the music begins and end when the music is complete. However, the fireworks need not be specifically coordinated with the music, ie. the use of Pyroditigal techniques during the show is not contemplated. 
3. The National Park Service is relying on the expertise of contractors to provide an commercially reasonable fireworks display over the allotted time period, at the lowest possible cost, as price is a significant evaluation factor. No number of shells, or shells of certain intensity, are explicitly required. 
4. The Government requires that all fireworks be staged and ignited from a barge located at a specific site in the Patapsco River east of the Park. Contractor will arrange for an adequate barge, movement of such a barge to and from site and cleanup of same after the program. No land based fireworks are contemplated. 
5. The designated Contract Specialist, Jason Pratt, may be contacted at the contact information included in the RFQ for a general overhead graphic of the location and the contemplated display. 
6. The due date for quotes is hereby extended to February 2, 2011. Quotes should be received by 12 Noon on the aforementioned date. 
7. Except as explicitly set forth above, all other terms in the previously posted RFQ hereby remain unchanged.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is N00421-11-R-0017 and is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15. The requirement will be full and open and the place of performance will be an offsite location near the&nbsp;Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, NAS Patuxent River is requesting Internet services for the following two locations: 1) Exploration IV and 2) Expedition IV, Lexington Park, MD. Services requested cover the procurement of circuit installation as well as monthly recurring charges. The circuits will temporarily feed internet connectivity to NMCI Deployable Site Transport Boundaries (DSTB) until a permanent DISA circuit and NMCI boundary can be procured. The following services requested in this SOW are the following:</p>
<p>Provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 15 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 120 users at 22299 Exploration Drive (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653. Currently a&nbsp;fiber&nbsp;infrastructure is not in place at this location.&nbsp;It will be the responsibility of the offeror to establish a fiber infrastructure at Exploration Drive (Bldg IV).</p>
<p>The second location is to provide a 1 GIG Fiber Port Internet Connection supplying 7 Mbps into a Navy provided CISCO 2811 with Dynamic IP Addresses to support 60 users at 46579 Expedition Drive, (Bldg IV) suite 300, Lexington Park MD, 20653.</p>
<p>The NMCI DSTB is configured with the following data interfaces: a) dual T-1, b) single Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), c) single Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and d) single gigabit multi-mode fiber. In order to accommodate NMCI bandwidth requirements of the users within these spaces the only solution is to utilize the gigabit fiber interface. <br /><br /><br />This action is required for the command to stay in compliance with force protection regulations governing occupancy. The command is currently in violation of these regulations in Exploration V and is realigning space allocations to new leased spaces (where these circuits will be installed).</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at 52.212-2 is applicable to this requirement and the evaluation criteria to be used in paragraph (a) are as follows: technical capability, price and past performance are in descending order of importance.

<p>OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Emergency lighting will not be required.<br /><br />6) Will new lighting be required?

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to request information for Government planning purposes only. Responses will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition. The Government is not committed to issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract as a result of this announcement. Army Contracting Center--Warren (formerly known as TACOM-Warren) is seeking qualified and capable potential vendors. Since this is a sources-sought synopsis and not a solicitation for receipt of proposals or quotations, the Government does not encourage questions concerning this market research. The scope of this market survey is to identify potential sources capable of performing all areas of required support to be considered responsive.<BR>The Government tentatively plans to award a single contract that would cover one base year and provide two 12-month options for additional performance. The planned contract scope will include Hardware and Services on a Firm-Fixed Price basis.  The Government is determining whether to issue a solicitation, which would result in a best-value award.  Evaluation factors being considered include, but are not necessarily limited to: Technical (experience, capability, management approach), and Price/ Cost. As noted above, no solicitation currently exists, and it is possible that none will be issued.<BR>The TACOM Integrated Logistics Support Center Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) Program is a set of maintenance actions based on real-time assessment of equipment condition which is obtained from embedded sensors and/or external tests and measurements using portable equipment. The goal of CBM is to perform maintenance only when there is evidence of need. The desired outcome of CBM is a force of maintainers with knowledge, skill sets, and tools for timely maintenance of complex systems through use of technologies that improve maintenance decisions and integrate the logistics processes. As a maintenance strategy, CBM is of interest because it can help optimize Army fleet maintenance programs. Using CBM can lower Government costs by decreasing false alarms and preventing unnecessary maintenance. It thus has the potential to improve operational readiness and mission reliability.<BR>The tentatively proposed CBM Program incorporates the following hardware and services:<BR><BR>Hardware - The Contractor shall provide approximately 2000 units of a CBM Digital Source Collector (DSC) capable of fulfilling the system requirements as detailed in Appendix A, which can be obtained by contacting Nancy Dulmage at nancy.dulmage@us.army.mil. <BR><BR>Services - The Contractor shall provide approximately 38 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) in support of the CBM global mission. The required support would be provided both in CONUS and OCONUS, with approximately 15 Field Service Representatives, 3 Field Technical Leads and 5 Data Analysts located at various sites CONUS. The OCONUS requirements are 4 Field Service Representatives in both Kuwait and Afghanistan with 1 Field Technical Lead and 2 Field Service Representatives in Germany with 1 Field Technical Lead. <BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>TACOM Army Contracting Command (ACC-WRN), 6501 E. 11 Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000.<BR><BR>Place of Performance: <BR>OCONUS - Afghanistan, Kuwait, Germany<BR>CONUS - 13 Installations - Eastern Lead, Midwestern Lead, Western Lead Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD , TACOM Warren, MI <BR>Planned start date: On or about June 2011.<BR><BR>Submission Requirements: Responses to this Notice shall consist of a short (5 pages or less using no less than 10 point font) capability statement detailing expertise in providing the scope of this program which includes; i) data collection and analysis services in multiple locations as detailed above, and ii) hardware to meet system requirements as detailed in Appendix A.  Responses shall include documentation of previous experience by detailing a description of the work or hardware provided including contract numbers if applicable.  Please provide any comments or suggestions on an alternative approach to that which is detailed above for consideration.   Responses shall be submitted electronically to the point of contact listed below by the closing date of 4 February, 2011 at 3:00PM EST. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Nancy Dulmage, nancy.dulmage@us.army.mil , 586-282-6249. <BR><BR>

Purpose

The Electromagnetic and Sensors Department (Q) at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is seeking information from industry relating to its need to integrate an antenna solution with an electronic counter-measure (ECM) system.  NSWCDD is primarily interested in companies with proven solutions (TRL 8+, systems composed of TRL 8+ components that have a path to TRL 8-9 are acceptable).
 Services include documentation and support. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to ensure an accurate Performance Work Statement, gather data regarding commercial industries interest, ability to meet existing customer goals and objectives, and determine the Governments acquisition strategy.   

Background

This RFI is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the customers need.  Currently, NSWCDD is tasked to integrate a high-power (approximately 100 Watts), multichannel ECM system onboard non-tactical vehicles (SUV, sedan, van, etc.).  ECM systems have large bandwidths (HF  L Band) and operate continuously as overwatch systems.
  

Preliminary Requirements

The following are preliminary requirements for this effort. NSWCDD anticipates and recognizes that some requirements may carry additional trade-offs depending on market research and the overall solution. It is highly encouraged that each submission discuss applicable trade-offs relevant to their antenna concepts. 



1.	Each proposed antenna must be able to be integrated easily onto a non-tactical vehicle.
2.	There is no limit to the number of antennas (total # of antennas in a given solution is one unit) required for the solution. 
3.	The ECM system may be networked with cell phone providers. The solution should provide maximum directionality for cell phone networks for operational use.
 For purposes of this RFI, NSWCDD desires a 30 deg Az/30 deg El beamwidth (from boresight). 
4.	In addition, the solution must provide an omni-directional pattern over the entire frequency range.
5.	The solution must be low-profile to the integrated vehicles.
6.	Each antenna must be capable of transmitting up to 150W average power

<DESC>Project Description: Construction pre-solicitation for the FY10 Congressional Add MCA PN059978/329828, Analytical Chemistry Wing (11,500 SF) and Administrative Area Addition (14,500 SF) to the Advanced Chemical Laboratory, Edgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.<br /><br />Construct a state-of-the-art advanced analytical chemistry wing for work with supertoxic chemical agents and toxins with associated data reduction space and administrative space. Construction will be phased to keep the existing labs, which contain supertoxic chemical agents, operational. The contractor will be required to work around these labs during construction. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is provided from a central plant. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; information systems; and site improvements. APG needs to construct an Advanced Chemistry Lab to meet its current mission. Current facilities are inadequate and now require impermeable surfaces, special chemical hoods with ultra-efficient carbon filtration, and extensive electrical backup systems. Safety and environmental controls are paramount to ensure that personnel and the environment are protected against these supertoxic and lethal materials. Design analysis prepared for this project indicates that significant experience with highly toxic and surety laboratory construction is necessary to support the successful completion of construction of this project within the established constraints. Additionally, the project includes significant renovation of existing laboratory and administrative spaces while maintaining daily function and mission requirements within the facility.<br /><br />The proposed procurement is unrestricted. NAICS: 236220 with a business size standard of $33.5 million. Estimated cost of services is between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. <br /><br />The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about November 23 2010, to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System. Please note that all Corps of Engineers acquisitions are considered sensitive, but unclassified documents and require users to have valid MPIN entered in the FBO systems to access package.<br /><br />The media through which the Government chooses to issue this solicitation will be the Internet only. This solicitation will not be issued in paper. No phone or fax request for copy of solicitation will be accepted. Proposals can be submitted after the solicitation announcement by mail to: <br /><br />U. S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Attn: CENAB-CT<br />Contracting Division <br />P. O.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
