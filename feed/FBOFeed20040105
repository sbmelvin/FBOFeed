<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Tampa, Florida, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract to Science Applications International Corp, (SAIC), 16701 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, CA 92127, to support the prototype of a hand held chemical vapor detection and identification system (SmallCAD). In 1999 The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) conducted a call for proposals to address DOD requirements for a hand-held chemical vapor detection and identification system.  TSWG selected Science Applications International Corp. through a competitive process to develop a prototype system. This contract will be to provide sustainment, calibration, maintenance, training; etc for the prototype systems, as well as research and development support for hardware and/or software modifications designed to meet USSOCOM user requirements. Once these objectives are met and evaluated, USSOCOM will decide on whether to procure SmallCAD systems.  The period of performance for this effort is through December 2003.
This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements.
The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice. See Note 22.

Request for Construction Documents Exhibit Solicitation 
GS-04P-04-CXC-0028
DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 
Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: 
(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and
(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and
(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,
(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.  *******************************************************************

<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit TSE International Incorporated, 5301 Shreveport-Blanchard Highway, Shreveport, LA 71107 on a sole source basis for one each Powered Reel Stand, TSE Model 18 132 x 115. The reel stand must deliver 90,000 In-Lbs of torque while handling an 18,000-pound reel measuring 132 inches in diameter and 115 inches in width.  The reel stand is designed for quick change of the reel without tools.   The reel employs a post-type level-wind, caliper brake, and can pay out or pay in the cable.  The reel stand operates on diesel fuel and is designed to withstand the weather of the Texas coastline.  The reel stand is not permanently mounted and can be moved with a forklift.  There are also lifting eyes to facilitate moving the reel stand with a crane. TSE Powered Reel Stand is the result of several difficu lt redesigns of previous models.  This model reel stand required extensive testing, redesign, and modifications to meet the Navy’s unique field repair requirement.  An alternate manufacturer will have to duplicate TSE’s design and development effort, which would significantly increase the cost of the stand. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Building 100, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 333120 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees. FSC is 2020.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment No. 0001.  RFQ 21451-0070, is hereby amended to incorporate the STATEMENT OF WORK for the Electrical Preventive Maintenance and Emergency Repair Services.  1.0, Introduction: The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Field Acquisition Office, Grand Prairie, Texas intends to award firm-fixed-unit-price/requirement type contract for the provision of electrical preventive  maintenance and emergency repair services at the Federal Correctional Institution located at Fort Dix, New Jersey 08640.

Some of the equipment is located inside the institution.  The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange a schedule with the successful contractor.  The following are the tasks that must be performed during the semi-annual and annual inspections.  2.2.1, Semi-Annual Inspection:  The following work must be completed two (2) times a year.  One inspection can be accomplished during the annual inspection, if the contractor desires to do this .  A written report will be given to the COTR outlining equipment checked and indicate that the following has been accomplished: (1)  Visually inspection primary switchgear for cleanliness.  Check all connection for indication of insulation breakdown, such cracking or burning.  Exercise manually all switching operations to ensure proper and smooth operation.  Confirm that proper size fuses are used.  (2)  Inspect overhead distribution systems, ensuring that poles, cross arms, insulators, guy wires, braces, lighting protection, etc., are in good condition.  Also, ensure that trees or other obstructions are not interfering with these systems.  (3)  Visually inspect underground cables and splices in access holes or pull boxes for insulation damage and ground and shield connections.  Visually inspect enclosure for cleanliness, signs of rodents and presence of water.  Where appropriate check drains for blockage.

Where current transformer capability is not available, alternative methods for obtaining primary loads are as follows: (a)  The power company can supply information if separate metering is available.  (b)  Secondary low voltage current readings can be taken and used to calculate the primary load.  (2)  Ensure protective devices are adjusted to reflect changes in load characteristics.  (Protective relay calibration should not be attempted without specific training and equipment).  (3) Arrange, as needed, for electrical power down time to perform the following checks and maintenance in addition to the required semi-annual inspection:  (a)  Tighten all switchgear and transformer cable and bus connections; particular attention shall be paid to primary connections.

TheCRIW/BEA joint conference title is: "A New Architecture for the US National Accounts."  This topic addresses the substance of BEA's major statistical release, the Gross Domestic Product and related statistical products.  BEA does not have the staff time to devote to logistics and administration.  

At a pre-conference in July 2003, the paper presenters assembled to give preliminary presentation and gather feedback from the other conference presenters.   In April 2004, the presenters will gather again with refined presentations prepared for the scrutiny of a large audience.  The latest research in measuring important economic statistics will be presented to an interested audience of experts in the field.   This conference and its resulting conclusions are of paramount importance to BEA, the producer of the US National Accounts, as they will set the agenda for the national accounts for decades to come. 

Project objectives:  The Contractor will provide all logistical and administrative services for conference.

Scope:

The Contractor will handle the conference administration and logistics. The provided services will include the arrangement of the meeting rooms, foreign and domestic travel arrangements, hotel accommodations, meals during the conference, audio-visual arrangements, and a tape transcript. The Contractor will include a conference charge that encompasses the organizers= personnel time spent arranging these services. The Contractor  also handles postage, shipping, duplication, printing, and phone and fax charges. No honoraria are paid to paper presenters nor organizers.

There will be between twelve and fifteen economic research papers presented, and approximately 100 attendees. All vendors must comply with FAR clause 52-204-7 and register at http://www.ccr.gov/. Reference No. DG1321-04-RQ-0029(GJH).

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type Contract to Concurrent Computer Corporation of Duluth, Georgia, for supplies necessary to procure Stimulation-Simulation Systems.  These supplies are needed to support the System for Naval Target Control (SNTC) system, which is an Over-The-Horizon (OTH) Target Control System (TCS).  The simulation system connects to and stimulates the actual Target Ground Control System (GCS), presenting the actual flight characteristics of an Aerial Target selected (BQM-34 & 74).  The system has the capability to induce failures or reduced performance to the Remote Control Operator (RCO) under instruction. Concurrent is the only manufacturer of simulation systems that are currently in use at Navy Target sites for the Aerial Target Simulation systems.  Procurement of another system would not be cost effective for the government.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Note 22. NAVAIR Synopsis No. 03-146.

V. 	Statement of Work for NDT CBT Certification (14 Nov 03)
a. Background: The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) performs contract management services for the Department of Defense and other Federal Agencies.  One of the critical contract management functions involves providing Government Contract Quality Assurance activities outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42 Contract Administration and Part 46 Quality Assurance.  Many of the activities outlined in the FAR require Government over-sight of the contractually performed inspections and tests.  One of the critical types of inspections and tests involve Nondestructive Testing (NDT).  Past practice was to certify and re-certify by examination, which was labor intensive and very expensive.  It is proposed that in the future Computer Based Training (CBT) be used to assist in NDT skills maintenance and to serve as a basis for demonstrating currency of skills (Certification Maintenance).  Commercially available CBTs have been identified that incorporates many of the competencies that are necessary for DCMA’s personnel, but additional modules and tests need to be developed to tailor the product for our purposes.
b. Description: Technical and programming services are needed to develop additional modules to augment a commercial Computer Based Training application that will be used to support Nondestructive Testing certification maintenance for NDT Specialists (Level II).  Contractor will provide this CBT service on CDs (Compact Disks) and the final delivery will be two sets of CDs (one Master and one certified copy) from which DCMA will be able to make user copies (if necessary), and 85 re-usable training CDs that cannot be copied by users.  The software must work in the DCMA Microsoft Windows environment and must be compatible with Adobe Acrobat.
c. Place of performance:  Contractor’s facility.
d. Date of Delivery:  The expected date of delivery is no longer than six (6) months from date of
award.  Offerors should provide a delivery schedule that meets or exceeds the expected date of delivery.
e. No contractor travel.  There will be a post-award meeting with representatives from DCMA at the contractor’s facility.  Date TBD.
f.  Anticipated Contract Line Items are below:
	CLIN 0001	One (1) master CD set for CBT NDT certification.  Specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.
	CLIN 0002	One (1) certified copy CD set for CBT NDT certification.  This certified copy should allow DCMA to make user copies, if necessary.  Other specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.  
	CLIN 0003	Eighty-five (85) reusable training CD sets that can not be copied.  Specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.
	CLIN 0004	Progress Reports every two months.  This CLIN will not be separately priced.
	One payment will be made when all CLINs have been delivered.
g.	 Needs/Deliverable:   
1) Progress reports at intervals not to exceed two month on product development reflecting milestone accomplishment for each deliverable with drafts.  These reports will not be separately priced under this purchase and or delivery order.  Any cost should be prorated under CLINS 0001 through 0003 prices.
2) A statement in the CBT introduction prior to the training portion that indicates the practices demonstrated in the CBT are acceptable in many industries, but some of the practices may not be acceptable based on specific contractual requirements.  DCMA’s technical personnel must review the contractual and technical requirements to determine the specific contractual requirements and allowable practices.
3) Material supplied by the contractor must cover both Types and all Methods of Liquid Penetrant techniques commonly used by all of the military services, including water washable fluorescent, fluorescent post emulsified lipophilic, fluorescent post emulsified hydrophilic (including high sensitivity penetrants and scrubber type emulsifiers), fluorescent solvent removed, and visible dye solvent removed (showing high temperature inspection of weldments, etc.).  Other areas that must be covered are all developer forms (dry powder, water suspendable, water soluble, and non-aqueous for both Type I and Type II materials), removal and removers, pre and post cleaning methods, complete processing parameters (concentrations, application methods, dwell times, drying times, temperatures, controls, calibrations, necessary equipment (and how to use it), lighting requirements), accept/reject criteria, inspections, evaluations, procedures, surface treatments & coatings, surface preparations, health hazards, new vs. used materials, and materials/practice limitations.  Quality control provisions are to be covered, examples are: system performance, system checks, brightness and visibility, penetrant removability & sensitivity, emulsifier removability, equipment & material checks (ovens, meters, black & white lights, water temperatures & pressures, penetrant material & developer contaminations, etc.), known defect standards, and markings & symbols identifying penetrant inspection.  Material will cover True, False and Non-Relevant Indications.  This information is to be provided in videos, pictures, text and audio format on the CDs.
4) A specific test question bank based on a pool of questions provided by DCMA that is capable of randomly generating 30 question tests.  The questions within the bank must be consistent with the guidelines of SNT-TC-1A.  Data bank test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).
5) A general test question bank based on a general test pool of questions provided by DCMA that is capable of randomly generating 40 question tests.  The question bank must be consistent with the guidelines of SNT-TC-1A.  Data bank test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).
6) A practical examination bank developed and supplied by the contractor that will consist of videotaped scenarios of penetrant inspections and system evaluations covering material required in 0003.  The examination bank will contain at least 4 different scenarios each of the Types and Methods listed in 0003 - water washable fluorescent, fluorescent post emulsified lipophilic, fluorescent post emulsified hydrophilic (including high sensitivity penetrants and scrubbers), fluorescent solvent removed, and visible dye solvent removed and various developer forms (dry powder, water suspendable, water soluble, and non-aqueous for both Type I and Type II materials).  The scenarios should show operating, method & equipment problems, and processing errors which the students will have to identify.  Part of the practical exam will also cover defect identification of digitized pictures of defects found by liquid penetrant (examples are: cracks in welds, forgings and castings, seams, laps, delaminations, cold shuts, porosity of both welds and castings, grinding cracks, fatigue, stress corrosion, and etc).  DCMA’s NDT technical authority will provide assistance in development of the practical examination, and the weighting of the examination questions will be dictated by DCMA.  Practical test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).
7) Add a CBT module that incorporates DCMA’s guidance on NDT as key processes, risk rating, supporting risk rational, and the use of appropriate risk handling tools.  This module will be suggestions of the likely activities used to proof the PT process, what typical activities would be accomplished when performing product audits, potential process measurement points, and suggestions on how to approach data collection and analysis for the PT process.  DCMA will write the content of this module.
8) A databank containing PDF files of Military/Government Specifications, Standards and Technical Publications on the subject of NDT.  DCMA will provide files.
9) Contractor’s material should also include information on current industry manufacturing processes, production methods and types of discontinuities that may be expected (digitized video clips, audio, pictures, and diagrams of metal production & mills; casting, welding, metal forming, forging, etc).  Module should go into detail (show actual defect types) of Inherent Material Discontinuities (Wrought and Cast), Processing Discontinuities, and Service Discontinuities.
10) Correct errors and incorporate changes in the contractor’s current database at DCMA’s direction.
h. Government Furnished Materials: DCMA will provide data, electronic files, and information which are the property of the Government.  At completion of the contract, all materials provided are to be returned to DCMA, and the contractor shall not use electronic materials or any other materials provided by DCMA outside this effort.  The contractor shall not duplicate, copy, or otherwise reproduce any furnished materials for any purposes other than those necessary to perform the contract.  The contract award is expected to have a tailored clause to allow the contractor to sell the DCMA copy, at the same price as a commercial product without the DCMA materials, to other government agencies.
i. Contractor Supplied Documentation and Software: The contractor shall ensure that all deliverables are prepared in a clear and concise manner, properly formatted, spell checked, grammatically and technically correct.  The materials required by task 0001 shall be reviewed by DCMA and comments will be provided within 10 working days after submission.

<DESC>COMBAT TALON II Amendment 003 (5 Jan 04) - Approved Acquisition Strategy The United States Special Operations Command(USSOCOM)Acquisition Executive has  approved the acquisition strategy for the Combat Talon II Program.  This  strategy includes a partnership approach with The Boeing Company, Lockheed  Martin, and L3 Communications Integrated Systems using the pre-competed  Integrated Weapon System Support Program (IWSSP)contract.  The Special  Operations Forces/Combat Search and Rescue System Program Office will return to  USSOCOM in Sep 04 for a Milestone B decision review. COMBAT TALON II Amendment 002(28 Oct 03)- As follows: The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) through a team at  Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR- ALC) is analyzing industry capabilities to convert 10 existing C-130 aircraft  into 10 MC-130 Combat Talon IIs.  An initial industry opportunity to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the Plus-10 program was held on 4 March 2003.  All contractors  attending were given a short descriptive briefing of the Plus-10 program and an  opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program requirements and to  present their capabilities and concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This initial step allowed the government team to  determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the  program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement. In general terms, the program’s intent will be to conduct an initial  modification to 10 existing C-130H2 aircraft.  The modification will convert  these ten aircraft into Talon II “like” aircraft minus the avionics required to  perform the terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) mission.  After  completion of this initial modification these ten aircraft will go directly  into the existing C-130 Avionic Modernization Program (AMP)/ Common Avionic  Architecture for Penetration (CAAP) program.  The overall objective will be  after the Plus-10 and the AMP/CAAP modification the final configuration of  these aircraft will be common, to the maximum extent possible, to the rest of  the Talon II fleet (post AMP/CAAP.)  Initial analysis by the government  indicates the systems listed in attachment 1 will be required to be installed  as part of the Plus-10 program.  This list is intended to only provide initial  guidance and is to be considered a working document that will evolve, as the  requirements are better defined.  (Please contact 1Lt Kelley Poree to request a  copy of attachment 1 as it will not be posted on the Internet).  In addition to  installing the current Talon II capability, the Plus-10 program will develop,  install and test an Autonomous Landing Capability (ALC) system.  An important  factor for this program will be to ensure a smooth and timely transition  between the Plus-10 program and the AMP/CAAP program.  Therefore, any approach  is required to clearly define how this transition can be accomplished.   Alternatives to these capabilities/ systems will not be considered as the  intent of the Plus-10 program is to provide the Air Force Special Operations  Forces (AFSOC) with MC-130H Talon II capabilities, seamless with current AFSOC  aircraft in their sustainment and support concept. ASC/LU will brief proposed acquisition strategy to the USSOCOM Acquisition  Executive in the November 2003 timeframe.  Additional information will be  available after this briefing and will be provided in a subsequent announcement. Any organization or company can obtain Combat Talon II announcements and  instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.  Questions regarding  the technical information mentioned in this announcement should be directed to  Philip Bourgoine (937)255-1791, mailto: philip.bourgoine@wpafb.af.mil.  All  other questions regarding this announcement should be directed to 1Lt Kelley  Poree, ASC/LUK (937)255-2748, mail to:  kelley.poree@wpafb.af.mil COMBAT TALON II Amendment 001(15 Oct 03)- Updated POC information (Program  Manager, Contracting Officer, and Buyer).

This is an initial  industry opportunity to meet with cognizant government  representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the Mod-10 program.  Contractors will be given a  short descriptive briefing of the Mod-10 program on 4 March  2003.  Contractors will be given an opportunity to discuss  their understanding of the program and to present their  capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.

POSITION TITLE:			Democracy and Governance Advisor
MARKET VALUE:	Ranging from $61,251 – 79,629 (Equivalent of GS-13 level).  Final compensation will be based on individual’s salary history, working experience and educational background.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
SECURITY ACCESS:		Secret
POSITION DESCRIPTION/SOW:

I. 	BACKGROUND

USAID/Tanzania (T) is a sustainable development Mission with four strategic objectives in Health/HIV/AIDS, Natural Resource Management, Democracy and Governance and Private Sector Development.  The Mission is in the last year of its current eight-year strategy and is in the process of developing a new 10-year Country Strategic Plan (CSP) that will go into effect in fiscal year 2005.  Mission management anticipates submitting the CSP for approval in Washington in April, 2004.

The Mission has identified democracy and governance as a key sector for its new strategy and has obtained approval from Washington to develop a new strategic objective as part of the new CSP.  The new SO will dovetail from the current SO: Civil society and government are more effective partners in governance.  The SO currently in effect has three intermediate results and focuses on building the capacity of key civil society organizations to advocate more effectively for key interests, and strengthening parliament.  USAID assistance in support of these intermediate results has taken a number of forms.  The DG Office has a cooperative agreement with Pact to implement a civil society capacity building activity.  The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has a sub-grant from Pact to work with NGOs to advocate for a legal framework supportive of an independent NGO sector.  The Center for Private Enterprise, another Pact sub-grantee, works with business associations to improve their public policy advocacy skills.  The State University of New York holds a contract to implement a legislative strengthening program.  This activity is co-funded by the British Department for International Development.  

The DG Office also has received additional funds to implement a five year anti-corruption initiative.  The activity is currently being designed, but the broad parameters include designing and implementing a public expenditure tracking system at the district government level, and improving the capacity of the media to report more effectively on public financial transparency.  The DG Office also has received ESF funds for civic and voter education in Zanzibar.  The activity is currently being developed in close consultation with the Embassy and other major donors.  

In the summer of 2003, USAID/T was notified by USAID/W that it would receive additional funds for the General Education in Islamic Communities initiative.  These basic education funds have been obligated through the DG Strategic Objective Agreement and are part of the DG SO.  A separate set of results and indicators are being designed for this activity which will be implemented exclusively in Zanzibar’s two main islands. 

II. 	STATEMENT OF WORK 

A. General

POSITION DESCRIPTION/SOW:

I. 	BACKGROUND

USAID/Tanzania (T) is a sustainable development Mission with four strategic objectives (SOs) in Health, Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), Democracy and Governance, and Economic Growth.  The Mission is in the final phase of implementation of its Country Strategic Plan (CSP) covering the period 1997 – 2004, and is in the process of developing a new 10-year CSP for the period 2005 – 2014 (the Mission anticipates submitting the new CSP for approval in Washington by May, 2004).

The current USAID/T ENR SO Program consists of a portfolio of activities aimed at achieving the Mission’s ENR SO “Improved Conservation of Coastal and Wildlife Resources in Targeted Areas.”  The ENR SO seeks to conserve Tanzania's unique biodiversity by advancing environmental policies, legislation and improved natural resource management (NRM) practices in selected areas.  USAID/T’s approach emphasizes partnership between government and civil society that supports and informs a participatory and transparent reform process.  Four intermediate results underpin achievement of the SO: 1) Natural resource policies applied; 2) Increased effectiveness of institutions that support natural resources conservation; 3) Improved management of targeted protected areas; and 4) Community-based natural resource management regimes functioning in target areas.  The SO serves customers at three levels: 1) conservation of Tanzania's biodiversity benefits the global environment; 2) improved conservation of critical resources for a growing national economy benefits all Tanzanians; and 3) improved NRM practices benefit rural communities living in and around targeted ecosystems by providing sustainable livelihoods.  The activity portfolio of the ENR SO currently includes several large grants, one contract, and two interagency agreements.  Two of grants include public – private partnerships under USAID’s new Global Development Alliance business model.  The Mission ENR Office includes the Team Leader, two professional Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs), and one FSN Administrative Assistant.  During the current CSP, annual expenditures of the ENR SO have averaged approximately $5 million.  The ENR SO also collaborates with and co-manages several ENR activities funded out of USAID Washington offices.  The overall ENR SO is guided by a broad-based expanded SO Team that unites USAID, key Government of Tanzania (GOT) agencies, and various NGOs.  The expanded SO Team serves a central role in the management of the ENR SO portfolio.  During the current strategy period, the ENR Program has consistently performed at a high level, and served in a leadership role among donors working in the wildlife and coastal resources sectors.

The Mission has identified ENR as a key sector for the new CSP and has obtained approval from Washington to develop a new ENR SO.  The proposed new program builds on the foundation and opportunities established by the current program, increasing the attention to improving rural livelihoods, while retaining biodiversity conservation as its core goal.  The rationale for the program rests on the linkage between environment and economic growth and poverty alleviation, and the need to establish a sustainable approach to natural resource-based economic development.  The current program has set the stage for managing an appropriate balance between conservation and development, through policy and legislative reform, capacity strengthening, and pilot activities.  The proposed program will continue investment in these areas, helping Tanzania to attain and maintain that balance, while achieving significant results in areas of both biodiversity conservation and improved livelihoods.  Funding levels for the new ENR SO are expected to be in the range of $4 million per annum.  In addition, the new strategy will seek to maximize linkages between sectors, and to leverage results through integration of cross-cutting themes and tools into program approaches.  Other development sectors expected to be part of the new strategy include health, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, and democracy and governance.  Cross-cutting themes include HIV/AIDS, governance, and gender; cross-cutting tools are public-private partnerships, information and communications technology, and capacity strengthening.

<SUBJECT>A--DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND QUALIFICATION OF AN ENHANCED ACES-II EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLY
<SOLNBR>BAA04001
<RESPDATE>011604
<ARCHDATE>01162004
<CONTACT>LEVONSON WHITE 301-744-6687 TOM BLACHOWSKI 301-744-2362
<DESC>The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIV, NSWC) is seeking proposals for development and qualification of an alternate technology for the Emergency Power Supply which is used on all variants of the ACES-II ejection seat.  The Emergency Power Supply (EPS) is a pilot-actuated, back-up component, which provides electrical power to deploy the main parachute during an ejection.  The current component is housed in an aluminum box, approximately 1.75 x 1.25 x 1.00 inches in size, which contains a mechanically actuated electrical power supply capable of generating 5.0 volts within 0.200 seconds of initiation and maintaining 5.0 volts for 0.500 seconds from that time.  The CAD Research and Development Branch is conducting a program to enhance the performance of the Emergency Power Supply while maintaining the identical form, fit, and function as the current design.  S pecifically, alternate, non-explosive, technologies are sought from the suppliers that will utilize the 10-22 pounds of mechanical pull force required to initiate the Emergency Power Supply, to generate the required output voltage to function the current parachute mortar cartridge.  These proposed alternate technologies should include the rationale for their selection for this program, any previous effort(s) conducted to evaluate these technologies in aircraft and/or CAD/PAD applications, and a phased approach to development, qualification, and implementation of the enhanced Emergency Power Supply design.  This announcement provides suppliers the opportunity to propose alternate concepts which the Government will evaluate through contractor performed Design Verification Testing and subsequent Service Release (Qualification) Testing.  Successful completion of these tests will  lead to the implementation of a new Emergency Power Supply for all variants of the ACES-II ejection seat.  Organizations wishing to participate in this program must submit a proposal to IHDIV, NSWC by 16 January 2004, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  Proposals may contain multiple tasks; however, each task must include its own deliverable, as each task may be considered separately for award.  The proposal tasks can range from proof of concept testing through sub-component development to full-scale component test efforts.  The Government intents to award one contract based upon completion of proposal evaluation.  Based upon on the availability of supplementary program funds, more than one contract may be awarded for other technology concepts.  Specific deliverables, delivery schedules, and contracts will be negotiated with successful offerers whose concept is selected for award.  All p roposals submitted under this announcement shall be considered Government property and will be treated as “Competition Sensitive” materials.  The Government may require unlimited data rights for development work performed under resulting contracts.  Proposals submitted shall include the following sections:  (a) cover page including title and both the technical and administrative points of contact, (b) a summary of the total proposal briefly describing the tasks to be performed, the deliverables, the costs, and the benefits of the project, (c) a detailed description of each task, not to exceed ten pages total for all tasks proposed (excluding cost/price data), which includes the following: (1) A Statement of Work detailing the each task, (2) a list of information and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) required, (3) a description of the deliverables and their benefit to the  project, (5) a schedule including milestones and time/cost profile, (d) a description of the offerer’s facilities, key personnel, and experience in the areas of interest (not to exceed 5 pages), (e) a SF1411 (Contract Pricing Data Sheet).

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) number 127690 is assigned and shall be referenced on any quotation.  This requirement is being conducted as a total Small Business Set Aside under the procedures of the FAR Parts 12 and 13.

The Standard Industrial Classification Code is 3699, (NAICS code is 333992), the size standard is 500 employees.  This solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Should any future information be publicized regarding this acquisition including solicitation amendments, it shall be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole-source basis with Castelo Enterprises, Inc., 9818 Ramsay Drive, Fredericksburg, Virginia  22408 for the purchase of the following:  1)  One (1) Universal Laser System with Stand, Auto Focus, 2.0 Lens Capable of holding Two Cartridges;  2)  Two (2) 70 Watt (total) Quick Change Air-Cooled Laser Cartridge with X-Y Beam Positioning Pointer;  3)  One (1) Universal Laser System Cutting Table;  4)  One (1) Universal Laser System Standard Air Assist;  5)  One (1) High Torque Rotary Fixture; and  6) One (1) day of installation/training at the FBI Academy.
