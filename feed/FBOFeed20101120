Successful contractor performance must include (1) the establishment of separate clinical registries for prehospital care, inpatient trauma care at member hospitals,and trauma centers, and for interfacility transfer; and (2) maintain collaborative relationships with the management and clinical personnel of the member EMS agencies and hospitals, making them a unique asset for the identification, enrollment and clinical data collection for subjects which USAISR wishes to study under the RemTORN project.<BR><BR>USAMRAA intends to negotiate this contract on a sole source basis with the Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council for Trauma (STRAC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. <BR><BR>This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.

 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items and services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  This notice and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511199 All other publishing & 516110 Internet & Web broadcasting.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov, in order to be considered for award.

 Description of services:  This requirement is for Social Media Monitoring.

1.  Title of Project:  Social Media Monitoring

	2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in the statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  Contractor will monitor all social media Web sites for content and postings relevant to the VHA, analyze content, and provide reports to Web Communications.    

	3.  Background:  VHA has made significant progress in establishing an interactive dialog with our customers through internet communications channels (i.e. social media).  With the increasing numbers and complexity of these sites, it has become apparent that there is a need to monitor the content posted by our customers for relevance, accuracy, and to identify unaddressed areas of Veteran's need.  VA currently has no internal monitoring system in place or available for immediate implementation.  Web Communications established a trial agreement in FY 2010 with the recommended vendor and is seeking to continue the agreement with this vendor to provide this service.
	
4.  Performance Period:  The period of performance is December 1, 2010 thru September 30, 2011.  Option year One: October 1, 2011 - September 30, 2012, Option Year Two:  October 1, 2012 - September 30, 2013, pending continued satisfactory performance.  Work at the government site shall not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the Contracting Officer (CO).
  
5.  Type of Contract:  Fixed Price

6.  Place of Performance: Work will be performed though the contractor's office.  No access to VA sensitive data or VA data bases will be granted.

 CONTRACT AWARD MEETING

The contractor shall not commence performance on the tasks in this SOW until the CO has conducted a kick off meeting or has advised the contractor that a kick off meeting is waived.

 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

	As per Statement of Work (below).
 
 SPECIFIC MANDATORY TASKS AND ASSOCIATED DELIVERABLES

  	 The contractor will provide social media monitoring and analysis on topics of interest to the Veterans Health Administration, based on a list of keywords provided by Web Communications. A dedicated account manager will undertake a daily review of content collected, and provide a weekly report to Web Communications summarizing the primary drivers of social media discussion on blogs.
 
Instant alerts will be issued for any identified blog posts or news items that could have a substantial impact on media coverage, or any potentially urgent issues.
 
Weekly reports will include links to blog posts and relevant material. Weekly reports will contain analysis of coverage, and charts/graphs of monitored topics. 

Web Communications may make changes to the list of monitored topics at any time. Any modifications to monitored topics that result in a change of overall volume may result in an additional fee, and will be discussed and agreed to by both parties. 

Requests for additional reports or projects may also result in an additional fee, and will be discussed if/when requested by Web Communications. 

The weekly report will be delivered on a day during the standard work week (Monday through Friday), on the same day each week. Weekly reports due dates that fall on a holiday will be delivered during the closest full working day to the standard due date, or at another time agreed to by both parties.

Background investigations from investigating agencies other than OPM are permitted if the agencies possess an OPM and Defense Security Service certification.

 The contractor shall prescreen all personnel requiring access to the computer systems to ensure they maintain a U.S. citizenship and are able to read, write, speak and understand the English language. 

 After contract award and prior to contract performance, the contractor shall provide the following information, using Attachment B, to the CO:

<DESC>Research to identify advanced integrated vehicle and component technology conceptsthat will allow subsonic transport aircraft to simultaneously meet the NASA subsonictransport system level goals of reduced noise, emissions and fuel burn in the 2025 (orbeyond) time frame. These advanced vehicle concepts must operate efficiently within theNextGen airspace system that is currently being developed. It is believed that to achieverequired aircraft SRL in this time frame, all critical technologies that could beconsidered enabling technology need to be at a TRL level of 6 by 2020. The results ofthis study are meant to be complementary to a number of on-going and planned governmentprograms such as the FAAs CLEEN program, NASAs SFW Project, and a number of Departmentof Defense programs.
