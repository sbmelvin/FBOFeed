<ARCHDATE>01172004
<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel 202/781-2866 Pamela Franzel, Contract Specialist, 202/781-2866/ Richard Swieter, Contracting Officer, 202/781-3946!!
<DESC>Background: The success of the war-fighting concepts of the Navy (Forward From the Sea) and the Marine Corps (Operational Maneuver From the Sea) requires the support of improved Naval Surface Fire Support capabilities.  Whether from close range or from over-the-horizon, these improved capabilities must support future amphibious operations and joint land battle scenarios.  A critical element in achieving these goals is the development of long range, low cost, lethal projectiles.  One such program currently under development to meet this need is the Extended Range Guided Munition program. Program Objective: The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors for the demonstration of alternative precision-guided munition concepts capable of being fired from the Navy MK 45 gun system by the end of September 2005. Specifically, NAVSEA seeks innova tive concepts for all weather, day/night alternative gun-launched projectiles capable of operation in the Mk 45 Mod 4 (required) and Mod 2 (desired) guns. For the top-level key lethality and performance parameters for the projectile, see the attached Proposer Information Packet (PIP), Solicitation Number BAA N00024-04-R-4302. The contractor is responsible for all aspects of the demonstration effort including, development/acquisition of propelling charge, arrangement of test facilities and activities, as well as any associated Government support. It is expected that the demonstration process will include subcomponent tests and all-up-round (AUR) tests. The subcomponent tests should be utilized to verify suitability for AUR integration and tests. The AUR flight tests should demonstrate that the design concept meets as many Key Parameters (long range, medium range, minimum range,  jammed and unjammed environments, lethality, etc.) as possible. The Navy also desires a telemetry system integral to the round to limit the number of test configurations. Mk 45 gun system interface verification tests are required with the Mod 4 gun system - this is to include round initialization tests to support system rate of fire requirements. Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System concepts must use Selected Availability Anti-Spoofing Module receivers with Black Keys. The knowledge, use, and implementation of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGs) and Allied Ordnance Publications (AOPs) in supporting the design and demonstration effort will be looked upon favorably. The contractor is not required to assess barrel wear issues attributable to the projectile and/or propellant charge; however, this is a key parameter so the Government will perform barrel wear an alysis of the Contractor's design during the demonstration effort.  Contractors must keep in mind that, even though they are not required to perform the analysis, their proposed concept will be evaluated with respect to barrel wear. A major goal of this BAA is to demonstrate low cost alternative guided projectiles.  The Navy requires an affordable projectile - one that costs $35,000 or less per unit, including the cost of the propelling charge; the unit cost objective is $15,000.  ACQUISITION INFORMATION: Offerors are free to team with any entity, including Federal and Department of Defense Laboratories. If an Offeror intends to team with a Federal entity, it should include a copy of the teaming arrangement or a signed commitment letter along with a description of the tasks the federal entity will perform and the costs associated with those tasks.  The work to be performed u nder this BAA requires access to classified data and a facility with a clearance level of Secret.  SOME INFORMATION CRITICAL TO PERFOMANCE OF WORK UNDER THIS BAA IS SECRET AND/OR NOFORN AND/OR SUBJECT TO THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT (TITLE 22, U.S.C. SEC. 2751 ET SEQ).  Accordingly, the Government will not release the associated technical data to any parties not meeting the security requirements. The Government is seeking participation from the widest number of Offerors.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or to team with others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA is set-aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.  Within the meaning of Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) at 6.102 and 35.016, this announcement and the PIP constitute the NAVSEA solicitation for this BAA. The Government intends to select for award the proposal(s) which overall represent a balanced approach to the technical concept, risk and proposed cost.  The Government considers technical to be significantly more important than cost.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal considering the following general criteria, listed in descending order of importance: a) Scientific and technical merit, b) Offeror qualifications, c) Past performance and d) Cost.  Specific criteria for each category can be found in the PIP.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, none of the proposals or a portion of a proposed effort received in response to this announcement.  The Government anticipates award of tra ditional FAR/DFAR contracts; however Offerors are free to propose other contracting methods, including Other Transactions.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals are due by 1400 EST December 18, 2003.  Offerors must obtain the BAA N00024-04-R-4302 PIP, which provides further technical and administrative detail for the BAA including specific performance requirements, evaluation criteria, and format for proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP will not be considered for award. Questions regarding this BAA or the PIP should be directed to the NAVSEA contractual point of contact, preferably through e-mail. The Government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offer ors should be alert for any BAA amendments or notices that may be published at the Federal Business Opportunities web site.

<CONTACT>Andrew Creedon 202-781-2593  William Randolph 202-781-3918
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command, (NAVSEA), Washington Navy Yard, DC, intends to issue a firm-fixed-price (FFP), full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) soliciting for the manufacture and delivery of MK 288 Mod 1 Igniter Assemblies.  The igniter assemblies are used in the propulsion system of the MK 48/ADCAP Torpedo. The igniter is an electrically initiated pyrotechnic device designed to activate the startup sequence for a MK 48/ADCAP Torpedo propulsion engine.  The igniter internal cavity contains a pyrotechnic charge hermetically sealed by a welded end closure.  The pyrotechnic material is in contact with a thin metallic wire bridging two electrical leads which exit the body head through fused glass seal circuitry.  The igniter body has external threads, a preformed packing seat, and a hex head designed for sealed installation into a standard boss port.  The igniter is fired by an electrical charge that causes rapid heating of the thin bridge wire and ignition of the pyrotechnic material, resulting in generation and expulsion of hot gas.  Based on existing funding, program profiles and Government estimates, it is anticipated that the resulting competitive contract will provide for the procurement of approximately one thousand (1,000) igniters in the Base Year, plus four one-year options to acquire as many as twelve hundred (1,200) for each option year. The Government currently anticipates that the evaluation criteria used in this competition will focus strongly on technical ability, past performance and price.

Each performance period will run 365 calendar days from date of award/exercise of option or until the maximum limit is reached, whichever occurs first.  The maximum fee limit may not exceed $1,000,000.00 per performance period.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar delivery schedules requiring the selected firm to provide services with overlapping work/delivery dates.  A minimum of $25,000.00 is guaranteed for the initial performance period and for each option period if no work is ordered after contract/option award.  Individual task orders are expected to range between $1,000.00 to $75,000.00 each.  The design scope will require architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, and minor environmental disciplines.  Due to the secure nature of some of these projects the government prefers that the mechanical, electrical, and civil disciplines be full-time permanent employees of the prime contractor.  The emphasis of the required support will be for the planning, design, preparation of specifications (materials, systems and assemblies), assessment and inspection of diesel engines, fuel tanks, electrical generators, uninterruptible power supplies, battery systems, distribution systems, protective equipment, and all ancillary facilities and structures.  Design of Special Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) or systems for installation within SCIF will be required.  Implementation of current and evolving DoD standards for Force Protection and Anti-terrorism is required.  Interfacing with existing or new security/anti-intrusion devices is required.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Lubos Navratil, Secretary, Crisis Management Staff of Central Bohemia Regional Government, Namesti Palacha 1960, 272 01 Kladno, Czech Republic, Phone: + 420-312-834-111.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to deliver technical assistance to develop an integrated emergency management system (IEMS) in the Central Bohemia Region of the Czech Republic.

The Government of the Central Bohemia Region of the Czech Republic is developing an IEMS.  The project would attempt to create a plan for cooperation between all governmental first-responders to work together.  There would be mutual sharing of databases as well as the development of networks that would allow for real-time sharing of information during a crisis.  A Regional Emergency Center (REC) would be established to coordinate the various efforts.  This center will be both a clearinghouse of information, through a dedicated Internet portal and database exchange, and a communication channel.  

The project will also involve the establishment of IEMS infrastructure for municipal emergency centers – 26 in Central Bohemia.  These will be created on a shared basis with the local fire rescue emergency centers (33).  The municipal emergency centers will act as points of communication and coordination.  They will coordinate closely with the REC.  This is a high priority task, since the newly created 26 municipalities with “extended authorities” will take over the responsibilities of the existing administrative districts. 

The objective of the technical assistance is to perform technical, environmental, economic and financial assessments of the project and to complete a conceptual design of an IEMS.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $395,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  RCS Kladno, s.r.o., a private Czech firm with substantial expertise in emergency management systems, has been pre-selected as a sub-contractor on this project.  The subcontract will be worth $51,550, however the details of the budget and the exact terms of reference for the subcontract will be based on negotiations between the U.S. firm and RCS Kladno, s.r.o.  A notional budget and terms of reference for the subcontract has been included in the bid documentation.  USTDA will hire an independent consultant to review invoices and deliverables from RCS Kladno, s.r.o.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, December 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Headquarters Standard System Group, Combat Ammunition System (CAS) Program Management Office is conducting market research to find if a commercial means of accounting for munitions can be attained.  CAS is a web-based system, accessed through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) that provides inventory accounting for all munitions stored and used by the United States Air Force at locations around the world.  CAS will incorporate both wholesale and retail functions.  The current CAS capability utilizes processes and procedures from the 1960s and hasn’t been updated to incorporate wireless technologies readily available in 2003.  It is web based, but only for the ability to store balances from all 45 prime sites at a central location.  Cost accounting methodology utilizes latest contract cost for all assets regardless of actual cost of individual items.  Wholesale functions have not yet been incorporated.   CAS is assumed to fall within three categories: (1) Stand-alone munitions such as bullets, grenades, etc; (2) Munitions that must be built up, such as a bomb and tail fins. Many different configurations can be built by mixing and matching components.  All components must be individually tracked even after build-up.  The end item must also be tracked by a common designation, and war planners must be able to do “what-if” exercises based on quantities of components. (3) Missiles; configuration data must be tracked—many missiles have internal components with individual shelf life and serialized control. Maintenance actions and movements must be tracked for the life of the missile.   CAS will be the sole accounting and tracking system for munitions.  From the time an item is planned for procurement at the depot until it is expended and reordered, CAS must account and reflect the current status.  Paperwork elimination is a primary goal and usage of the Air Force Identification Card, the PKI enabled Common Access Card (CAC), is essential.  Automated in-transit tracking is desired, using technology similar to “On-Star”, for example.  Serialized control is required for all items with unit cost exceeding $500 for accounting and maintenance (TCTO) actions.  Storage and shipment require edits to assure maximum net explosive weights and explosive material compatibilities are not violated.  Expenditure updates upon release from bomb bays/wings (when in the clear) is desirable; however the ability to scan aircraft and update launch-load records upon return is acceptable.   Continued incorporation of CAS into GCSS is required.  CAS must be able to be used anyplace in the world utilizing ruggedized equipment with either commercial or military web access.  Autonomous operations must be able to take place in the event connectivity is broken with automatic update upon reconnect. The updated CAS must be simple, take advantage of common operator knowledge and have a simplified user interface including set-up and operation.    Interested vendors should submit their capabilities information via email to gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil or mail to: HQ SSG/PK, 490 East Moore Drive, Suite 270 (Bldg. 892), Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3004.   The capabilities information should show what can be done to achieve CAS roadmap and should address any significant foreseen risks.  There are no pre-conceived restrictions on design.  The information should include a graphical prototype and a description of the concept in 10 pages or less. Please specify whether the firm is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Also, specify if the firm is U.S. or foreign-owned.  All responses should be received on or before COB 12 November 2003.  This is a request for information only.  No solicitation will be generated or contract awarded as a result of this request.   Additionally, the Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this request for information.  For specific questions, please contact Ms. Gail Sosa at 334-416-6430 or gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil.

In carrying out its responsibilities and program activities, USAID/CAR maintains a central headquarters office in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and satellite offices for liaison and communication support in each of the four other republics.   USAID/CAR is opening an Astana branch office in November/December, 2003.  

The USPSC position is located in the USAID/CAR Astana Office.  This position is unique in that it is located in the same country as the USAID Central Asia Regional Office.  In other countries in the region this position would be responsible for the overall coordination and management of the country programs.  The Country Office Coordinator for Kazakhstan is primarily responsible for coordination with various ministries of the Government at the ministerial level.   Since the regional office is based in Almaty, maintenance of these relationships has been more difficult.  Whereas the incumbent will be responsible for knowledge of all USAID and other donor programs in Kazakhstan (ensuring that there is appropriate coordination and drafting Kazakhstan-related reporting documentation), this position will not be responsible for the direct day-to-day management of USAID programs within Kazakhstan.   However, it is anticipated that this position will assume CTO responsibilities for some Kazakhstan specific activities.

B.  BASIC FUNCTION

The Country Office Coordinator for Kazakhstan reports directly to the USAID/CAR Mission Director or his designate in Almaty and provides monitoring and coordination of contractors and grantees based in Kazakhstan.   The Country Office Coordinator works closely with USAID/CAR team leaders based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in coordinating all USAID-funded activities in Kazakhstan including major programs in fiscal reform, financial reform, enterprise development, democratization, health reform, infectious disease, NGO development, PVO assistance, and the environment.   The Country Office Coordinator is expected to contribute actively and substantively to USAID program designs for Kazakhstan and to assume CTO responsibilities for some Kazakhstan specific activities.   The incumbent will be expected to interface regularly with key Kazakh Government and private sector counterparts on ensuring USAID program impact and counterpart satisfaction with assistance.

C.  MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Country Office Coordinator for Kazakhstan serves as the primary liaison official for the USG assistance program with the Government of Kazakhstan, the American Embassy office in Astana, private voluntary organizations, and international donor organizations.   The Country Office Coordinator maintains effective communication between the USAID/CAR Mission, the U.S. Embassy in Astana, USAID grantees and contractors, other donors, and the Government of Kazakhstan.

The Country Office Coordinator is responsible for knowledge of all USAID assistance to Kazakhstan and the activities of institutional contractor personnel operating in Kazakhstan.   The Country Office Coordinator may do some direct program and project monitoring as requested by USAID/CAR.

Through field observation, analysis and consultation with host government, other donors and other local entities, s/he may also identify needs for USAID assistance in areas consistent with the NIS assistance program.  The incumbent advises USAID/CAR of these needs, and, as required, develops concept papers outlining the potential USAID response in consultation with appropriate strategic objective team leaders.   The Country Office Coordinator will be consulted on allocation of annual program budgets.

 
When the U.S. Embassy permanently relocates to Astana, the Country Office Coordinator will serve as a member of the American Embassy/Kazakhstan Country (Astana) Team on behalf of the USAID/CAR Mission Director.   In this regard, the Country Office Coordinator consults closely with the Mission Director to ensure that USAID/CAR’s views are properly reflected.   In the interim, the Country Coordinator is expected to have frequent contact and work collaboratively with the Embassy’s political and economic section based in Astana.	

The Country Office Coordinator provides regular and frequent reporting to the relevant strategic objective team leaders in Almaty on progress, impacts, problems, constraints, and issues related to USAID-financed programs in Kazakhstan.   The Country Office Coordinator is expected to review and approve work plans, monitoring plans, and reports for activities financed by USAID in Kazakhstan.

The Country Office Coordinator is responsible for a variety of reporting requirements (in consultation with technical and program support offices) including preparation of USAID’s MIR 4 and Annual Report, the EUR/ACE annual report, and other miscellaneous reports and ad-hoc requests.

The Country Office Coordinator meets with other donors in Kazakhstan to ensure that programs are complementary and consistent. In addition, he/she ensures that all USAID/CAR staff are informed of other donors plans and activities in Kazakhstan.

The Country Office Coordinator is responsible for administrative management of the Astana office and personnel.   In consultation with the USAID Controller and Executive Officer in Almaty, the Country Office Coordinator ensures that all administrative and accountability requirements related to USAID operations and activities are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures.  The Country Office Coordinator maintains close coordination with Office Directors and works closely with the Public Information Officer to ensure that the USAID program in Kazakhstan is appropriately publicized.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information on technology options encompassing imaging sensors and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) capabilities that can detect and quantify damage that may occur in-flight to the Space Shuttle Orbiter’s thermal protection system (TPS).  Such damage may occur during launch or on-orbit from debris impacts and may be of any form, including cracks, delamination, gouges, holes, or even missing tiles or panels.   The concept is to detect flaws by measuring the two-dimensional and three-dimensional contour of critical vehicle surfaces. Several inspection mounting locations may be employed, including, but not limited to: (1) the external propellant tank (ET) (imaging the orbiter belly as it separates after main engine cutoff), (2) solid rocket booster (SRB), (3) on an extendable Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) arm, (4) on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) remote manipulator arm or other external mounting location, (5) inside a space station window (viewing the orbiter as it pitches around during its approach to the ISS), or (6) on a free-flyer.  The viewing geometry and relative motion will be different at each mounting location and the TPS surfaces have a variety of contours and reflective properties.	Preliminary imaging/sensor/NDE requirements are listed below. Measurement:	Detect and quantify 6 mm diameter x 6 mm deep and larger holes with Spatial (2-D) Resolution &lt; 6 mm, Depth Resolution &lt; 6 mm Minimum Imaging Speed:  0.07 m^2/s at 2 m range; 5 m^2/s at 180 m range Imaging/Sensor-Target Range & Motion (as a function of inspection location/scenario):     ·From ET/SRB (Image orbiter belly from mate (1 m) to &gt; 50 m at + 1.3 m/s) ·From SRMS/SSRMS (1 to &gt;/= 5 m range; 3-axis arm translation oscillation of +/- 6 mm at 0.67 Hz and +/- 1 deg rotation at 0.67 Hz)	 ·From ISS window  (Orbiter 360 deg rotation of 1-2 deg/s at 180 m range) ·From Free-Flyer (up to 3 m/s) Eye Safe (preferred) Minimum sensor performance under specified lighting conditions and incidence angle. Incidence angle is the angle between the line of sight from the inspection device, and the normal from the surface being examined. Small volume, low mass, low input power Interfaces: ·Electrical power ·Command and Data ·Thermal ·Structural Capable of specified performance in the respective mounting environment Flight hardware and software available and flight certifiable for use in an on-orbit space environment. Parameters to be considered include:     Launch/Landing loads up to 10g	Operation in vacuum of 10e-07 torr      Exposure to atomic oxygen	Exposure to cosmic ray radiation        Exposure to thermal extremes	EMI susceptibility Requested information, for one or more of the mounting scenarios, includes functional and physical description, size, weight, power consumption, technology readiness level, design maturity, environmental specs, thermal control requirements, and cost (non-recurring and recurring).  If you responded to posting #9-BH13-93-03-29P, and your previous response does not require revision, you need not respond to this posting. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.	A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to the point of contact listed below no later than December 5th 2003.  Please reference NNJ-BH2-H93-005P in any response.

Headquarters
FMCSA Headquarters includes 9 offices reporting to 4 Associate Administrators: Administration; Research, Technology, and Information Management; Policy and Program Development; and Enforcement and Program Delivery.  The Administrator’s staff offices for this project include the Offices of the Chief Counsel, Public and Consumer Affairs, and Civil Rights.  As stated, Senior Executive Service employees (Associate Administrators and the Assistant Administrator) are not included in this project.
 
Current Series and Position Descriptions 
The development of position descriptions will address positions in an estimated 17 classification series. The estimate of 55 standardized position descriptions, plus or minus 10%, is based primarily on grade levels that are now or are likely to be used for FMCSA jobs within those series. In some instances, multiple functional titles are being applied to jobs in the same series and grade.  The expectation is that standardization will result in fewer series and fewer titles. 

The series that will be analyzed for this effort are among 24 in use in FMCSA.  The others are in the process of standardization by FMCSA personnel specialists, are being eliminate, or the positions are being include under other, more appropriate series.  While those series will not require development of standardized position descriptions, they will factor into the establishment of competitive levels.  

REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall supervise contract personnel.  The contractor shall administer, manage and perform the tasks defined in the Requirements Description.  Contract representatives shall work closely with the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to accomplish coordination and approval of each task before completion/submission.  Projects will be defined by the COTR.  

The contractor shall prepare and report bi-weekly activities and costs (including travel) for those activities.  Copies of this report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative by the 2nd workday of the following following week. 

Deliverables that are primarily text, including interim reports and other narrative documents, will be produced in MS Word. Tables that are used for calculations or have potential to be used for calculations or for export to database software will be produced and delivered in Excel (even if copied into Word or PowerPoint). All Position Descriptions and supporting documents must be delivered in MS Word, and they must be produced in a format accessible to individuals with disabilities according to the provisions of Section 508, Subpart B of the Rehabilitation Act.  Other acceptable software applications include Access for database management and PowerPoint for presentation documents.  Presentation documents in PowerPoint must also be provided in Section 508 compliant format or accompanied by equivalent, compliant documents. Use of other software applications must be pre-approved by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative.

<DESC>Description:

Request for Information (RFI) for Concepts of Operation for the provision of meteorological observations from aircraft.  Date: 31 Oct 2003.  Contact: U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, Office of Science and Technology (OST), Tom Roberts, 301-713-1975, 124, Thomas.Roberts@noaa.gov.

Synopsis:  

Request for Information for Concepts of Operation for the collection of meteorological observations from aircraft.  OST is requesting information on operational concepts that have the potential to achieve all or many of the requirements delineated in the National Weather Service (NWS) Statement of Need summarized below.  OST is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  OST is interested in receiving information with regard to sensors and/or sensor technologies; data collection management concepts; and data collection, processing and distribution capabilities that can improve the quality, frequency, and geographic distribution of meteorological reports from aircraft.  The greater temporal, spatial and vertical resolution of these reports will allow for improved forecast accuracy and more frequently updated forecasts.  

Statement of Need:

Small-scale environmental events have profound effects on aviation safety and the economic well being of the nation.  The nations’ ability to predict short-term, small-scale (mesoscale) environmental change is restricted by meteorological observations that are incomplete in time and space.  The government must work in partnership with industry to improve the nation’s observing systems and enhance predictive models and methods of dissemination.  

The NWS has a requirement for sustaining and improving the current high-resolution data set of meteorological observation elements in the troposphere provided by the Meteorological Data Communications and Reporting System (MDCRS).  The MDCRS data set provides ascent, descent and en-route reports of wind speed and direction, temperature and pressure.  The data is transmitted to NWS National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) where it is used in high-resolution data assimilation and forecast systems.  The current MDCRS data set has three major deficiencies that the NWS wants to address with this effort.   The first deficiency is the critical absence of operational water vapor data.  Mesoscale reports of in-situ water vapor will result in a significant improvement in convective weather forecasts.  This information may allow forecasters to predict the start time of convection within 30 minutes.  The second deficiency is the lack of effective controls or mechanisms to manage and limit the collection of data relative to NWS temporal and spatial requirements.  This results in a significant level of redundant observations, especially at the hub airports, and translates into excessive and unnecessary communications costs.  The third deficiency is that the mix of aircraft is not optimal.  The NWS prefers the ascent and decent profiles more than the enroute observations.  This translates to a preference for regional carriers versus major air carriers.

Mesoscale atmospheric profiles consisting of temperature, winds and moisture are needed to forecast, warn of, and verify mesoscale convective phenomena.  For the purposes of this document mesoscale refers to data reporting in a horizontal spatial scale of ten’s of miles and a temporal scale from minutes to a few hours.   The spatial, temporal and accuracy requirements for an improved mesoscale atmospheric observing system will be provided upon request.  Please E-Mail Phillip Osborne at Phillip.Osborne@NOAA.gov for an electronic copy of the tables.

Concepts of Operation:

Responses should describe the offerors management and technical approaches to address the deficiencies described above, existing or projected performance capabilities, and the identification and availability of any pre-production prototype and/or production hardware.  Offerors that would like to submit white papers describing their abilities to meet the requirements should request the second part of the RFI package, the NWS Statement of Need. This can be obtained by submitting a letter of interest via email to the Government Contracting Office POC listed in the first paragraph. 

The performance parameters for the proposed concepts of operation should be accompanied by sufficient rationale for the Government to verify the offerors claims.  Responses to this RFI should be no more than 20 single sided pages, excluding any available test data. The Government is not interested in general company capability information and will not accept such submissions. Submissions will be accepted via e-mail only and should be sent to the addressee shown below. Questions concerning this RFI should be directed to the above-mentioned POCs via email.

<DESC>The Contract Management Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking capability statements from small business organizations with technical expertise and facilities to support the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), NIAID in achieving its goal of providing unique and quality assured biodefense-related reagents and resources to the scientific community. NIAID is seeking contractors to development, characterization and validation of in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess the safety of cell substrates and vaccine components that are being considered for use in vaccine manufacturing. The need for contemporary in vitro assays and in vivo animal models has arisen from 1) the development of vaccine candidates that can only be grown in cell substrates and/or require use of excipients or adjuvants that have not previously been used to manufacture licensed vaccines, and 2) previously unrecognized theoretical safety questions.  For example, few tests are available to specifically assess certain safety issues that are unique to new cell substrates.  These issues include tumorgenicity of the whole cell substrate, oncogenicity of the cellular DNA, and the detection of latent/occult adventitious agents in the cell substrate.  Experimental data are needed regarding these issues in order for manufacturers and regulatory agencies to meaningfully assess and analyze the safety of vaccines manufactured in these new cell substrates.  

This is a new effort; there is no incumbent contractor. These critical contracts will develop both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess current and future safety concerns that arise regarding vaccines and vaccine manufacturing and/or formulation, including 1) assessing the tumorgenic potential of cell substrates; 2) assessing the oncogenic potential of cell substrate DNA; and 3) screening for latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.

The contractors must have the capacity and capability to work with at least one of the following specific areas of in vitro assay development or in vivo animal model development: 1. Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal model(s) to assess tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  2. Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to assess and characterize tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  3.  Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal models to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA. 4. Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA. 5. Develop, characterize and validate assays for detection of novel or latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.   To the extent possible, efforts should focus on applying existing technologies, reagents, techniques, and animal strains to animal model development.  For example, proposals to develop assays for in vitro analysis of the oncogenic potential of live cells could include a more thorough development and validation effort of the currently used growth in soft agar assay.

The contracts will be awarded as cost-reimbursement effort type with the emphasis being on the contractors’ ability for the development, characterization and validation of in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess the safety of cell substrates and vaccine components that are being considered for use in vaccine manufacturing.

Any capability statement submitted must address the requirements in sufficient detail so that technical approach, including develop and validate the in vitro assays and in vivo animal models, production and quality control; ability to provide contract management, including start up, facility operations and transition, inventory control and distribution may be evaluated.
 
The Government anticipates multiple awards. It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be five years with an estimated level-of-effort of 8,500 labor hours per year. Interested Small Business organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. No submission shall exceed a maximum of 25 1-sided pages in a 12 point font. No collect calls will be accepted and no facsimile transmissions will be accepted. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 54171, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. See contact information above.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF SPAWAR CAA Process
<DESC>SPAWAR Commercial Area Announcement (CAA) Process 1.0 DESCRIPTION 1.1 The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Officer ? Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence and Space (PEO-C4I) is submitting its developed Commercial Area Announcement (CAA) process for public review and comment.  The CAA process is a means of requesting technical concept papers/product capability statements and demonstrations, as applicable for commercial state of the art technology. In some cases it will consists of an  announcement combined with a FAR Part 12 solicitation.   The purpose of this process is to expedite the acquisition of the latest commercial  and demonstrated technology. 1.2 In the CAA process, there are two potential acquisition paths, based on the maturity of the commercial technology.  After issuance of the CAA, industry will be allowed to demonstrate its technology.  Then for technology requiring development, or intense testing/demonstration  before fleet introduction, SPAWAR may issue  a Request for Proposal (RFP), in accordance with FAR Part 15, based on the program of record.  For commercial technology that has been tested in the market place and may only require minimal testing for fleet readiness, SPAWAR may issue a CAA/Request for Commercial Offering(RCO)/Request for Quotes (RFQ).  The RCO will represent an open solicitation and contracts will be awarded via RFQs in accordance with FAR Part 12 or Part 13 procedures. 1.3 The CAA will be open for one year based on an area of interest.  Topics can be added during that year.  SPAWAR will notify industry of potential opportunities through the issuance of the CAA,  the addition of  topics to the CAA, and the issuance of any subsequent RFP/RFQs. 2.0 BACKGROUND The attached brief outlining our CAA process was presented at the National Defense Industry Conference held in San Diego, CA on 24 October 2003 by Captain Basil Gray. Comments from industry on the process were solicted at the conference for SPAWAR?s consideration.  The command has implemented this process in two test cases:  (1) Headquarters for the 21st Century (HQ 21), (N00039-03-R-0006) and (2) a CAA for distributed services (N00030-R-0030).

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) on behalf of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with QRC Division of Macro International Inc. (QRC), Bethesda, MD for a progress assessment of NIH-Sponsored Behavioral and Social Sciences Research using the Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database (1993 – 2002).  The period of performance is three (03) months.

QRC shall perform queries of the CRISP database to identify grants in behavioral and social sciences research and determine the activity level in this area at the NIH from Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 to FY 2002.  The study will focus on the following five behavioral and social sciences research topics in answering the question “To what extent has NIH sponsored more behavioral and social sciences research from 1990 through 2002?”: biopsychosocial, cultural and lifestyle factors, methods, behavior change and violence.

QRC shall develop a set of SAS programs to query the CRISP database using a set of rules developed and provided by the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) at NIH to identify competing research grant awards relevant to behavioral and social sciences research.  Using the SAS programs, QRC shall search the project titles, abstracts and thesaurus terms in the CRISP system to select studies that included one or more keywords relevant to behavioral and social sciences research as outlined by OBSSR.  QRC shall then select potentially relevant CRISP records and delete appropriate records using information provided in an OBSSR algorithm.

QRC shall meet with OBSSR staff to gain a solid understanding of the specific research topics to be analyzed.  QRC shall conduct a review of the CRISP thesaurus and program documents relevant to each topic to establish a preliminary keyword list for the topic.  QRC shall develop an algorithm for each topic that includes the keywords judged to be most relevant to the topic.  The algorithm will include directions for ruling out irrelevant CRISP records and directions for identifying records that should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

QRC shall review the SAS logic and results of the CRISP queries and create an Excel spreadsheet for each topic.  Using the spreadsheet listings, QRC shall review the CRISP records selected for each topic to exclude studies that are not directly related to the particular topic.  QRC shall analyze the final set of grants relevant to each topic to determine the number of different NIH Institutes and Centers (Ics) awarding Research Project Grants (RPGs) in FY 1993 and FY 2002 and to identify the lead Ics in FY 2002.  For each topic that had an increase in the number of RPG awards from FY 1993 to FY 2002, QRC shall conduct a chi-square test to determine if the increase was significantly greater than the increase in RPG awards that did not involve the topic.  QRC shall summarize the results in formatted tables and appropriate graphs and charts.

The NIH has determined QRC to be uniquely qualified to perform this work.
 The study calls for the use of the CGAF to obtain additional information about the grants awarded and Principal Investigators in the behavioral and social sciences.  The CGAF is currently supported by the NIH Office of Extramural Research.  From its creation in 1979 through 1988, the CGAF was maintained by the National Research Council.  Since 1989, the files has been maintained and updated annually by QRC.  This data is contained in the Privacy Act system of records.  QRC has access and a unique knowledge of the database.  The staff at QRC routinely utilizes this data to perform similar analysis for the NIH community.  Furthermore, the methodology proposed for this study was developed and utilized in an evaluation study for the NIH Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH) performed by QRC.  

This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-029/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.

<DESC>(1) General Statement of Research Need 

The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD), supported by the Marine Corps Systems Command Contracts Office, is soliciting proposals that address research and development for next generation non-lethal weapons that can support critical warfighter needs.  Today’s warfighter require non lethal weapons to: deny area to personnel in an urban / suburban /aquatic environment, stop a vehicle in an urban / suburban environment, separate combatants from non-combatants, render an individual or group incapable of performing an activity, deny access to bridges, stop water surface and sub-surface vessels, clear a facility of personnel without entering, and non-lethally force an airplane to land.  Next generation non-lethal weapon proposals sought under this BAA shall dramatically increase ranges, have safe human effects while proving effective as a non-lethal weapon and have universal effects (i.e. effects that are independent of target age or gender).  For example, a non-lethal counter-personnel weapon shall be safe and effective across the span of the human population; a non-lethal counter-vehicle weapon shall be effective against all makes and models of vehicles. 
 
Submissions should describe new and/or existing technologies that can be used in existing military platforms / systems. This solicitation will not fund development of any new delivery systems; rather the focus should be on the proposed non-lethal payload, its accompanying target effects and overall effectiveness in addressing warfighter needs.  Proposals that address delivery systems or methods, without detailed consideration to the non-lethal payload, its effects and effectiveness, will not be considered for award.

As a general guideline, non-lethal counter-personnel technologies should have the following characteristics: universal effect, quick human effect onset time (less than 90 seconds), ideally has a human effect duration of between 10-60 minutes; temporarily renders target incapable (incapacitated) or unwilling (deterred or dissuaded) to continue aggressive action; and is difficult to countermeasure, and can be stored for at least 5 years.  Proposals that use chemical or biological payloads will not be considered for non-lethal counter-personnel concepts.

As a general guideline, non-lethal counter-material technologies should have the following characteristics: universal effect, minimal collateral human effects, be reversible or require minor repair (for example a vehicle or vessel that is stopped by a non-lethal means should be able to continue on its way after inspection). Proposals that use biological payloads will not be considered for non-lethal counter-material concepts. Proposals that use chemical payloads must be consistent with U.S. obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and other applicable law and regulations. 

A statement of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the technology is required (A description of TRLs and proposal format can be found at the JNLWD website www.jnlwd.usmc.mil in the Technology Investment Program tab).   

The proposals should address work to be conducted over a period not longer than two years. 
A minimum of $1.8 million is available for award in FY04 for initial efforts.  The number of proposals awarded will be determined after a review of all proposals.  A single award or multiple awards are possible.  No award will be made if the proposals do not have the potential to demonstrate significantly enhanced or advanced non-lethal weapon capabilities.

All proposals selected for funding will be required to submit quarterly status reports that include financial data and present a Director's review biannually.   At project completion a comprehensive report and out brief will be required. An evaluation team will recommend at the conclusion of each project whether to further pursue this technology.  

(2) Instructions for Preparation of Proposals
Offerors are invited to electronically submit, in either MS Word or Adobe Acrobat, with a file size no larger than 1.5MEG (this size limitation is required because of server limitations), a proposal.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SKC Pamela Nelson pamelan@roosevelt.navy.mil
