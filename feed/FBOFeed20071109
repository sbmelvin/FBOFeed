<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is seeking proposals for an Information Architecture (Software and Hardware) Design, which will enable logistics modernization for the United States Marine Corps (USMC). This Information architecture will be a core component of the Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) ONR Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program. We expect that multiple awards will be issued, with a down selection to a single design with the selected performer having the  opportunity to develop and demonstrate the Information Architecture as part of the S&RL Program. Inherent in the design will be the capability to integrate / demonstrate multiple components either from existing USMC logistics systems or S&T products developed under separate contract.
The program goal is to develop and demonstrate a flexible, distributed ?systems of systems? networked architecture - both hardware and software - capable of providing measurable advances in logistics Planning, Decision, Execution, and Assessment (PDE&A) functions. 

The following are the main Products Areas for the S&RL program. These products are listed to provide potential offerors insight into the scope of the overall S&RL program focus areas and technical efforts needed to address them for this solicitation.  The products should transition into Programs of Record (PORs) such as Global Combat Support System ? Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) or Autonomic Logistics (AL) baseline in technology spirals for early transition. 

Intelligent Sensor Systems ? Complex data sensors operating on scavenged power that are network addressable. Part of a mesh network infrastructure monitoring equipment health, operating status, location, and state to LRU level.  Smart sensor and signal processing algorithms for a variety of sensors capable of maximizing knowledge extraction at the point of collection and minimizing the bandwidth needed to propagate information (knowledge would be forwarded if deemed useful by the processing algorithm).

Intelligence Agent Technologies ? Capability to accurately assess platform health, usage, and remaining useful life for disparate equipment/system types.  Component level, system level, platform level, and enterprise level prognostics models that function in an open, distributed network environment.  Agents that generate ontologies based on correlation between unit tactical compositions, mission requirements and logistic resources required to sustain operational tempo. Emergent behaviors are quantified and leveraged in an adaptive environment.

Predictive and Adaptive Fuels Management Tool ? Planning and decision support tools to improve battlefield fuel management (options generator for dynamic allocation, automated status and location, platform consumption forecasting, rate of usage).  

Decision Support Tools ? Capability for performing predictive planning, adaptive analysis of evolving environments, real time dynamic updates, data analysis and courses of action development based on Commander?s intent.  Automated tasking and assessment tools for accurately determining measures of effectiveness.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, an agency within the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), serves as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and health promotion and health education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States.  Substantial portions of CDC resources are directed toward conducting unique surveys, epidemiologic studies, and research programs in which primarily human biologic materials are collected, characterized, tested, and a portion stored for future laboratory investigations.  In a number of instances the biologic materials obtained in these investigations cannot be replaced or obtained elsewhere.  Collectively, these materials represent a unique public health resource that may prove invaluable in future investigations.  The CDC and ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory, and Repository (CASPIR) is intended as a repository for valuable, primarily human, biological materials obtained through CDC and ATSDR programs and activities.  Well-characterized specimens/collections are stored that could be of potential use for future scientific endeavors.  These specimens/collections are inventoried and stored under controlled optimal conditions. The CDC will seek through solicitation/Request for Proposal, a contractor that will provide all labor, materials, equipment, supplies, supervision, and also perform all services required to operate and maintain the CDC and ATSDR Specimen and Data Bank (CASPIR) to ensure that valuable collections of primarily human biological materials, including blood components, tissue, bacterial isolates, DNA, and other biological and environmental specimens, obtained through CDC programs and activities are properly inventoried, securely stored, maintained, managed, and when needed, retrieved and delivered to scientists.  (Some aliquoting of specimens may be necessary.)   The anticipated performance period of these services is April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009 with four 12 month option periods.  The solicitation is scheduled to be posted online at www.fbo.gov on or around November 28, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing after the solicitation has been posted in accordance with the instructions in Section L of the solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available from CDC.  Contract award is contemplated no later than March 31, 2008.

Subject: 	Pre-solicitation Notice #623-KE-08-003, entitled "Draft Requirement of the Pharma Project in Kenya"

Dear Interested parties,
This is to inform you that USAID has released the draft statement of work for the "USAID Pharma Project" for your close review and considered comment. Comment must be provided no later than Tuesday, October 23, 2007, 4:30 pm, (Kenya time) via email to codonnell@usaid.gov, pmuthee@usaid.gov and cafrica@usaid.gov.

The draft statement of work may be found at http://www.usaid/gov/ke/ under "Business and Procurement" sublink or sent via email by the above named individuals upon request. In summary the purpose of the pending requirement is to establish and operate a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable supply-chain management system to forecast, procure, store, and distribute the drugs, supplies, and equipment needed to provide care and treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS in Kenya. At the moment, USAID foresees that the contract requirement will not entail actually procuring laboratory materials and equipment such as rapid test kits, reagents or machines. 

A lesser but equally important component of the Pharma Project will be to build the capacity of Kenyan institutions and personnel in supply chain management in order to ensure the effectiveness, quality and sustainability of HIV/AIDS interventions.

The anticipated ceiling price is over $500,000,000.00 over a maximum 5 year period of performance.

USAID plans to hold a Pre-solicitation Conference in Nairobi, Kenya on or about November 6, 2007. Details of the conference and the registration process will be communicated through an Amendment to this Pre-solicitation Notice. The complete RFP in draft form should be released no later than October 31, 2007, prior to the planned pre-solicitation conference. 

Sincerely,
Christopher D. O?Donnell

Any questions with regard to this requirement shall be addresses to the Purchasing Agent/Contract Specialist identified elsewhere on the solicitation/award document. All offers shall be evaluated for fair and reasonable price, technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, delivery schedule and adherence to the applicable clauses/provisions.  Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors? representatives must be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. ?Employee Eligibility Verification Form?). The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee?s eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Secutity/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029). Service contractor: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract. IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENVOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. 		******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

<DESC>This synopsis is being issued to amend Solictation No. NND07204397Q-DAC previously issued on June 20, 2007.  This synopsis is amended to use FAR Part 15 and not Part 12 and 13, in the procurement of this requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. NASA/DFRC has a requirement for an F-16XL Return to Flight & Supportability Study, which explores the feasibility of returning to flight F-16XL Ship #1 also identified as Air Force Tail Number F-16A 75-0749. This study involves fundamental research into sonic boom propagation through the atmosphere and boom intensity mitigation.  This study should:  (1) Determine the capability to support the F-16XL #1 Block 40 derivative Digital Flight Control System (DFLCS) to include a written statement of capability to perform hardware and software upgrades and verification and validation, identify the initial investment costs required to re-establish the flight control test stand and V&V capability, and provide a copy of the red-lined DFLCS wiring modification identified as drawing configuration number 400FTD032  (2) Provide documentation to determine the definition and perform analysis to determine the state of the Electronic Component Assembly (ECA), provide a written statement of capability to maintain and/or upgrade ECA hardware and software (3) Provide an estimate of the cost required to incorporate the ECA functionality for leading edge flap and auto-pilot into the DFLCS and provide a more production representative DFLCS that will enhance long term supportability  (4) Determine the capability to support the current Block 10/15 Avionics Suite or upgrade to a more supportable CCIP/EPATH F-16 configuration, or replace the avionics suite with a suitable COTS type system. The CCIP/EPATH configuration would not require upgrades for RADAR or weapon systems  (5) Provide support to Dryden personnel to develop a ?Linebacker? type ruggedized ground support computer and re-host the memory inspect software and any additional aircraft support software  (6) Provide consultation to Dryden as necessary to perform hardware and software modifications required for installation of the F100-PW-220/229 or F110-GE-129 engine, provide electrical schematics for the current F-16XL engine bay configuration, perform engineering analysis to determine the performance capability of the F110-GE-129 engine on F-16XL #1 with the small air inlet  (7) Assess the status of the LVDTs on the leading edge flap actuators  NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company because (1) Lockheed Martin is the manufacturer of the F-16 and was responsible for the development of the two F-16XL variants, (2) Lockheed Martin has maintained support and upgrades of all F-16 aircraft systems, and (3) the F-16 design, system integration, and many of its systems are proprietary to Lockheed Martin. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 26, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a FAR Part 13 basis and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Sandy Jackson, 8410 Clay Drive, Fort Washington, Maryland 20744 for 480 hours of support to the NINDS Division of Extramural Services (DER) in preparation of automated data products that expedite and facilitate the review of grant applications being reviewed at NANDS Council.  This automated support is provided to the DER/OD during three cycles per year.  The established business process between the DER/OD office and IRMB requires specific business knowledge of the NIH grants process and the eRA enterprise database schema to provide ?electronic books? with required turn around times as short as 4 hours.  There are currently over 40 books produced for each round.  Each of the queries that support the creation of an electronic product requires maintenance, modification, testing and quality review for each round.  Each of the data products will be updated multiple times in the workflow up to their final presentation/use at the NANDS Council.  

Her knowledge of the NINDS Council business process and enterprise data sources allows her to perform the creation of electronic Council books with minimal input from the DER/OD.  She is able to initiate the modifications to the underlying queries and begin testing months before they are due.  This business knowledge reduces the burden of interaction that the DER/OD office must have to provide requirements during their busiest times of the year.  Sandra has intimate knowledge of the enterprise data repository (IMPAC II), the meaning and location of required attributes in the appropriate tables (Oracle database instances) and the structure of the data being processed (which tables to link and how).  This allows her to extract and format the data products to meet the very tight turnaround deadlines required by the Council process, while maintaining extremely high data quality.  She also has expert knowledge of the NINDS standard desktop, Oracle, MS Access and ODBC that enable her to perform her function.

Delivery and acceptance will be at the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. Period of Performance: 01/08/2008 to 12/31/2009

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. 

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI274327 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Kathleen Gregory, Contract Specialist

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm-fixed price purchase order to John R. Eppinger Jr., 943 Woolen Mill Road, Stewartstown, PA  17363-8083.  Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304? only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Section 1815 of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that amounts paid to providers of services be based on reasonable cost for the services as determined under Section 1861(v) of the Act.    Furthermore, by regulation, each provider must submit an annual Medicare Cost Report (MCR) setting forth all costs for which the provider claims reimbursement.  The Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM) is an extensive set of interpretive guidelines and policies published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to assist contractors and providers in applying the reasonable cost reimbursement principles.  The Division of Cost Reporting (DCR) is responsible for publishing and updating the PRM and the MCR forms.  DCR must update and rewrite numerous payment policy areas in the PRM and regulations based on legislative and policy changes as articulated in regulations such as the hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and related charge compression issues in both OPPS and the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS).  Extensive revisions to the hospital MCR are also required to incorporate the policy revisions and items such as new technology cost and current industry practices.  Major revisions to the hospital MCR have not occurred since 1996.  At the present time, there is no one within CMS available who has the requisite expertise, knowledge, and skills to revise the PRM to incorporate the required policy revisions. John Eppinger possesses the experience, knowledge, and expertise that are required for this project.  He has approximately 40 years of experience with Medicare reasonable cost principles and payment policy.  During that time, John was a highly regarded senior analyst in DCR who was in constant demand by his peers and junior staff for guidance and direction on Medicare reimbursement issues.  In any given day, John responded to many calls from fiscal intermediaries, policy analysts, and outside stakeholders on a variety of topics related to Medicare reimbursement.  John worked countless hours providing guidance on numerous policy areas including reasonable cost, apportionment, periodic interim payments, and the uninsured.  He also provided technical assistant to the policy components in the Center for Medicare Management (CMM), and with the OFM relating to various provisions of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) as related to cost reimbursement and cost reporting.  The activities that John supported are extensive and his effort supported several of the themes characterized in CMS?s strategic statement including:  paying appropriately, accurately and effectively for health care; managing the evolution of our programs strategically; and partnering with our stakeholders.  The OGC and the Office of the Attorney Advisor (AA) utilized John's expertise on a regular basis.  He was the Agency expert witness on many PRRB cases.  John's comprehensive knowledge of the statutes, regulations and the PRM on the subject of cost reimbursement is invaluable asset to CMM and the Agency.  As a result of this work, Mr. Eppinger has acquired an in-depth and unique knowledge of Medicare policy.  He has vast knowledge and experience with the reasonable cost principle on which the PRM is based.  Mr. Eppinger played a critical role in the development of the PRM used by contractors and providers in applying the reasonable cost reimbursement principles.  He has expert knowledge of the extensive set of interpretive guidelines and policies in the PRM and regulations.  Mr. Eppinger is the expert in understanding how policies inter-relate and how to revise it without unintentionally adversely affecting other policies which would result in inconsistent application of our policy.
The agency is under significant pressure to make substantive changes to the MCR to expand numerous cost centers such as the supply cost center on the MCR.  It is imperative that the revisions to the hospital MCR and PRM address the latest payment policy changes so that providers are paid appropriately.  Mr. Eppinger retired on August 3, 2007 and many of his responsibilities were assumed by other CMS employees with less experience.  However, due to the complexity of the PRM, sustained time, hands-on experience, and one-on-one tutelage are prerequisite to fully learning and comprehending the intricacies of the policies related to Medicare reimbursement.  Since the PRM revisions relate to work the Mr. Eppinger performed exclusively while he was an employee at CMS, only he can train and transfer this information to his successors.  Moreover, Mr. Eppinger's experience and unique expertise continue to be needed in the review and response to PRRB decisions, litigation, and policy settlement recommendations.  Without Mr. Eppinger to train and transfer knowledge, and without his availability to ensure smooth integration of revisions to the PRM, updates to Medicare reimbursement and payment policies will be delayed indefinitely.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Program Officer shall make the determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise. The anticipated award date is no later than December 10, 2007 and the period of performance is one year from award date.  NAICS CODE 923120.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is seeking proposals for an Information Architecture (Software and Hardware) Design, which will enable logistics modernization for the United States Marine Corps (USMC). This Information architecture will be a core component of the Sense and Respond Logistics (S&RL) ONR Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program. We expect that multiple awards will be issued, with a down selection to a single design with the selected performer having the  opportunity to develop and demonstrate the Information Architecture as part of the S&RL Program. Inherent in the design will be the capability to integrate / demonstrate multiple components either from existing USMC logistics systems or S&T products developed under separate contract.
The program goal is to develop and demonstrate a flexible, distributed ?systems of systems? networked architecture - both hardware and software - capable of providing measurable advances in logistics Planning, Decision, Execution, and Assessment (PDE&A) functions. 

The following are the main Products Areas for the S&RL program. These products are listed to provide potential offerors insight into the scope of the overall S&RL program focus areas and technical efforts needed to address them for this solicitation.  The products should transition into Programs of Record (PORs) such as Global Combat Support System ? Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) or Autonomic Logistics (AL) baseline in technology spirals for early transition. 

Intelligent Sensor Systems ? Complex data sensors operating on scavenged power that are network addressable. Part of a mesh network infrastructure monitoring equipment health, operating status, location, and state to LRU level.  Smart sensor and signal processing algorithms for a variety of sensors capable of maximizing knowledge extraction at the point of collection and minimizing the bandwidth needed to propagate information (knowledge would be forwarded if deemed useful by the processing algorithm).

Intelligence Agent Technologies ? Capability to accurately assess platform health, usage, and remaining useful life for disparate equipment/system types.  Component level, system level, platform level, and enterprise level prognostics models that function in an open, distributed network environment.  Agents that generate ontologies based on correlation between unit tactical compositions, mission requirements and logistic resources required to sustain operational tempo. Emergent behaviors are quantified and leveraged in an adaptive environment.

Predictive and Adaptive Fuels Management Tool ? Planning and decision support tools to improve battlefield fuel management (options generator for dynamic allocation, automated status and location, platform consumption forecasting, rate of usage).  

Decision Support Tools ? Capability for performing predictive planning, adaptive analysis of evolving environments, real time dynamic updates, data analysis and courses of action development based on Commander?s intent.  Automated tasking and assessment tools for accurately determining measures of effectiveness. 

Numbered Notes:
13.  The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award.

<SOLNBR>RFI-BPCU1107

<CONTACT>Edwina Wilkins, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-283-2752, Fax 202-283-4429, Email edwina.a.wilkins@irs.gov
<DESC>This notice is to extend the response date from November 5, 2007 to November 19, 2007. The Internal Revenue Service is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for a Binary Print Compare Utility that meets U.S. Government Section 508 compliance standards (Visually Impaired/Blind Accessibility).  This product needs to be fully Section 508 compliant, or data should be provided as to when should be fully Section 508 compliant.  The IRS requires that all interested vendors address how their product meets or will meet each of the technical standards listed under ?Subpart B?Technical Standards 1194.21 or 1194.22 found at this site: http://www.section508.gov/ (http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Software).

Technical Requirements:

The Internal Revenue Service produces taxpayer notices in IBM Advanced Function Printing (AFP) format using several document composition tools, including Document Sciences Compuset, and IBM Elixir DesignPro Tools.  Taxpayer notices are currently produced on an IBM zSeries mainframe, running IBM z/OS operating system.

We have begun a multi-year effort to migrate taxpayer notice production to a new hardware platform: Sun UltraSPARC running Sun Solaris operating system.  Taxpayer notices will be produced on the Sun using the Document Sciences product xPression.

As we migrate the production of taxpayer notices from the IBM zSeries mainframe using legacy document composition tools to the new Sun environment utilizing Document Sciences xPression, we require a binary compare utility which will allow us to compare print files electronically.  The utility should report the differences between the files in an easily understandable format, or report that files have no differences when no differences exist.  The utility needs to provide the capability to ?mask? differences, be able to compare a ?Reference file? ? and ?Test file? ? of differing sizes, compare reference file and test file with differing encoding and /or byte ordering, compare AFP files with differing internal structures, compare non-printable fields such as Tag Logical Elements (TLEs).  The utility is not required to run on a Sun UltraSPARC running the Sun Solaris operating system; however it is deemed beneficial due to the long range vision of notice migration.

Below is a detailed explanation of each requirement:

1.	Compare AFP files generated with the same or different composition tools on the 
same or different hosts (z/OS and Solaris).  The table below summarizes possible combinations.
Reference File created on Host / using Composition tool:	Test File created on: Host /using Composition tool
z/OS / Legacy composition tools	z/OS / Legacy composition tools
Solaris/ xPression	Solaris/xPression
z/OS / mainframe composition tools	Solaris / xPression 
Solaris / xPression	z/OS /mainframe composition tools

2.  	Provide masking capabilities at the individual field, page, and document level to
allow comparison of files with the ability for the user to exclude reporting on known differences.  For example, reference and test files being compared could be composed using different fonts (arial versus helvetica), different font types (outline versus raster), different font sizes (12 point versus 8 point), or the reference file could contain a graphic image on the first page of each notice, while the test file does not contain the graphic image.  We require the ability to exclude known differences from the reporting.

3.  	Provide a method of synchronizing files, so that if the reference file and the test file contain differing numbers of records, the can be compared with an indication of which records occurred only on one file.

4.	Compare files with differing internal structures (MO:DCA print streams) This could be due to different structured fields or different MO:DCA triplets within a structured field.  For example, the reference file contains a page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field.  In addition, for the reference file, the page segment is also mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field in the active environment group for that page.  The test file contains the same page segment referred to in an ?Include Page Segment? (IPS) structured field, but in the test file, the page segment is not mapped with a ?Map Page Segment? (MPS) structured field.  The printed output looks identical.  We need to know that the rendered output is identical.  (see requirement six below for non-printable fields).  Please see the IBM document number SG31-6802-07 Data Streams and Object Architecture Mixed Object Document Content Architecture Reference  for information on MO:DCA.

5.	Compare print files with different encoding schemes (ASCII, EBCDIC, UNICODE UTF-8 and UTF-16, big-endian and little-endian byte ordering) performing the appropriate translations so that files produced on different platforms can be accurately compared.  For example a reference file is created on z/OS with EBCDIC encoding with big-endian byte ordering, and the test file is created on a Sun Solaris 64-bit system with UTF-16E.  

6.	Tag Logical Elements (TLEs) if present in the print files being compared, must also be compared, and differences reported.

Statement of Need:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if any vendors have a Binary Print Compare Utility that is Section 508 compliant and capable of fulfilling the technical requirements listed above.

Requested Response:

Your response must be limited to 5 pages.
As part of the response for each product, the responder should provide the following information for the Government?s consideration and review:

	We require each vendor to explain:
-If your product meets or exceeds each element in the technical standards listed in ?Subpart B - - Technical Standards 1194.21? Please include section number(s)   
  and  paragraph letters being addressed, and respond to section(s) appropriate to   
  the product.  This is expected to be section 1194.21 ?Software applications and 
  operating systems? paragraphs a through i, or section 1194.22 ?Web-based 
  intranet and internet information and applications? paragraphs a through p.  
  (Note that Section 508 compliance is for developers, business customers, and 
  field end-users use of the product)
  - Does the product meet each of the 6 technical requirements listed above and 
  - Does the product correctly interact with adaptive screen

 Reading software JAWS by Freedom Scientific (hhtp://www/freedomscientific.com/). 
 	
All responsible sources who can provide the specified product as stated above shall submit a written response that includes enough technical detail to allow the IRS to conduct a technical evaluation.  The response should include POC (name and telephone number); GSA contact number if applicable; Delivery date; Business size and Payment terms.  Telephonic inquires will not be accepted.  All questions must be submitted in writing and may be submitted by e-mail to:  Edwina.A.Wilkins@irs.gov.

<DESC>KC-10 Cargo Net Elevation Tool (CNET)

  The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to a lighter KC-10 cargo net with integrated hoisting system that will minimize manpower and reduce time necessary to manually raise and secure cargo net during cargo operations.  The system proposed should be low profile, lightweight and integrate with the current cargo net attach points. The new net must meet all current KC-10 G-Ratings.  
  The lifting system must not interfere with the net?s rated cargo restraint capability nor will it reduce the internal contour limitations of the cargo compartment.  Hoist can be manual or motorized but must be able to support the raised cargo net (approximately 235lbs) whenever it is not required to be fully lowered and installed for cargo operations. The new net and integrated lifting system must not weigh more than current net, approximately 235lbs.
This Request for Information (RFI) may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.

Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL AMB INFORMATION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN GROTON, CT.  This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs with regard to the planned execution of a Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. It is anticipated that this SETA effort will have a performance period of five years.  In a rough order of magnitude, it is anticipated that the effort required over the five-year period may be in the range of $50M.

In July, 2007 the USCG announced the official stand-up of its newly consolidated Acquisition Directorate (CG-9) which brought all elements of Coast Guard acquisition under one command. One of the offices under CG-9 is the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Office, CG-926 and the CG Research and Development Center (RDC). RDC is the USCG's sole facility performing research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) in support of the USCG's major missions of Maritime Law Enforcement, Maritime Safety, Marine Environmental Protection and National Security. RDC supports CG acquisition and regulatory processes and strives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CG operations and resources. RDC is also the Coast Guard's principal systems center supporting key acquisition decisions.

The USCG is seeking information on companies that have the capability to augment the capacity, acquisition experience, and technological expertise of the RDC in their role as advisor and consultant to CG-9 and their sponsors. This augmentation will result in a long-term partnership to provide support of major systems throughout the acquisition lifecycle.  

Tasking typically involves complex analyses that require multidisciplinary technical integration of expertise in the following  functional areas:   requirements, alternatives, and cost analysis; systems engineering and planning; prototype evaluation; environmental and human systems analysis; logistics; safety and security analysis; modeling and simulation; workforce and staffing analysis, test and evaluation; operations analysis; statistical analysis; acquisition strategy; manufacturing readiness; technology maturity analysis; risk analysis; market analysis, user wants and needs assessments, gap analysis; business case development; generation of data intended for a USCG solicitation and participation in proposal evaluations in an advisory capacity.  In support of tasking requirements, facilitators and facilities may be required for workshop-based sessions (e.g., collaborative requirements generation).

In addition to CG and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decision makers, target audiences for final products and presentations include high level government and non-government reviewers and organizations such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Inspectors General (IG), the United States Congress, etc. Credentials of the staff involved in the creation of these products have to clearly demonstrate expertise with analysis tools and technology, along with experience with major systems acquisition. 

When RDC activities support major acquisition efforts, the need for independence and clearly demonstrated absence of conflict of interest, real or perceived, is of critical importance. The SETA contractor will be a close confidential advisor to the RDC and the USCG. The SETA contractor will assist the RDC in evaluating proposals, performance, and products of other contractors, thereby giving them access to proprietary information about potential competitors. The SETA contractor will also have access to proprietary, source-selection sensitive, or otherwise restricted information. Because of the close confidential relationship required of the SETA contract, the RDC is concerned that this will cause other private sector firms to be reluctant in pursuing future work with the RDC, and that the release of proprietary information to the SETA contractor would have an adverse impact on competition in future CG procurements. In order to mitigate these concerns, the RDC intends to impose strong Conflict of Interest (COI) restrictions on the SETA contractor. These COI restrictions include the prohibition of the winning offeror, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors from participating (in any capacity) in any USCG major and non-major systems acquisitions, other than those activities in direct support of the SETA contract, throughout the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years. The SETA contractor, its employees, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors will be prohibited from using any proprietary information obtained in support of the SETA contract for the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years or until the information becomes part of the public domain, whichever comes latest. 

Capability statements in response to this market research shall include the following: (1) a description of the capabilities, analysis tools used,  and infrastructure components that meet the needs of the RDC activities and functional areas described above in support of major Government acquisitions (limit 6 pages); (2) a description of company history with regard to (a) how multidisciplinary experience was obtained or developed  and (b) types and/or combination of types of awarded contract vehicles (e.g. Cost Reimbursement, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Fixed Price , Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time & Materials, etc.) (limit 1 page); (3) a description of how compliance with the RDC COI requirements will be met (limit 1 page); (4) a description of the degree of teaming needed to meet the requirements listed above and to accommodate the possible surge in level of effort (limit 1 page); and (5) a statement of business size and classification with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the capability statements received.  No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be posted at the FedBizOpps website.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.  Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the USCG. Capability statements shall be sent directly to: Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil with a copy to jim.b.hazlin@uscg.mil.     Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later than 25 November 2007.  PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) OR AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), NOR IS IT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. NASA/KSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a follow-on Research & Development (R & D) study ?Simulation Tool for Spacecraft Lateral Slosh Prediction Study?. The purpose of this study is to understand lateral slosh and to refine techniques for modeling slosh in general.	A series of test, utilizing the Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR), will expand NASA?s knowledge of slosh behavior as it is influenced by the presence of diaphragm type propellant management devices (PMDs).  Particular emphasis will be placed on diaphragm shape stability for larger size tanks.  Of particular interest in this effort is obtaining answers to the following questions: 1. Under launch level random vibrations and spin-up conditions, do larger scale (23?) diaphragms assume a preferred shape? 2. What are the sensitivities in natural frequency, response amplitude and damping to differing lateral acceleration load levels? 3. What are the differences in natural frequency, response amplitude and damping resulting from diaphragm shape variability? 4. Is there a different type of test that can be performed using the Spin Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) that will yield a richer set of information that is more compatible with the Parameter Estimation methods being developed at ERAU and KSC? This procurement is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisition.  NASA/KSC intends to purchase these professional services from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX 78238.   This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably availably from only one source. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.    The primary equipment needed for the testing involved in this study is unique, specialized, one-of-a-kind NASA owned equipment located at SwRI plant in San Antonio, Texas.	The Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) is a large assembly, approximately 10?x10?x10? feet, with power and control wiring hard-wired throughout SwRI?s facility.  Interested contractors would have to travel to SwRI to perform this testing, as the SSTR cannot be relocated without incurring significant shipping and labor (disassembly/assembly) costs estimated at $61K.  SwRI has the unique expertise as the design agency, and developer of the SSTR. SwRI personnel are expert in the design, operation and test specific modification of the SSTR. This capability was recently demonstrated by SwRI in the SSTR modifications made to perform the Generic Centerline Tank Study.  Another contractor would have to duplicate costs to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.	Unacceptable delays in schedule would result due to another contractor having to duplicate the learning already achieved by SwRI.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing via e-mail or fax to Karim F. Hourani; FAX: 321-867-4848, E-MAIL: karim.f.hourani@nasa.gov not later than 3:30 p.m. local time (Eastern Standard Time) on November 26, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Internet Note ?B?.

<DESC>Background

The United States Postal Service (USPS) desires to engage in a process with companies to discuss establishing a General Purpose Stored Value Card Program.  This process requires the submission of information from interested companies followed by USPS evaluation.  Potential companies that satisfy this evaluation process may be asked to engage in discussions with representatives from the Postal Service, and may be requested to make a formal presentation in-person and final evaluations will then occur.  A business agreement, in a form provided by Postal Service, is the expected result.

Purpose

The USPS desires to sell General Purpose Stored Value Cards at approximately 15,000 locations nationwide. The USPS General Purpose Stored Value Card Program will be operated as an alliance between the USPS and a commercial partner.  The selected partner will be responsible for product design, development, production, distribution, customer service, advertising, marketing, merchandising support, application processing, card fulfillment, transaction processing, funds settlement, and store-level reporting.  The partner will assume responsibility for transactions resulting from funds loaded on cards sold by the USPS.  The partner will also be liable for replacement of any lost or stolen card. The USPS will be responsible for card sales, point of sale activation of cold cards through point of sale equipment, and reloading of such cards.

Description

The USPS General Purpose Stored Value Card program will be comprised of two types of cards:

  @  Instant Issue Card - The instant issue General Purpose Stored Value Card will be sold for any dollar amount up the limit established by the USPS and its partner - not to exceed $500.  The funds loaded on the cards will be immediately available to the purchaser.  The instant issue card will not be reloadable.

  @  Registered Card - After the initial purchase of an instant issue General Purpose Stored Value Card, customers will have the option of obtaining a personalized, e.g. registered, card by calling the partner's toll-free number and providing their name, date of birth, social security number, street address and telephone number and government issued ID number (driver's license, passport etc.).  When this option is selected, an embossed card will be sent to the customer by First-Class Mail at the expense of the partner.  Upon phone activation of the embossed card, the original card will be de-activated and the partner will transfer the remaining funds on the de-activated card to the new registered card.  The registered card will be reloadable up to the maximum value established by the USPS and its partner - not to exceed $5,000 at any time and the aggregate reloads will not exceed $20,000 during a calendar year.  Customers who obtain registered cards will receive monthly account statements by First-Class Mail at the expense of the partner.

It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

SCOPE: The USCG is searching for vendors interested and capable of assisting the USCG in implementing its Recreational Boat Testing and Factory Compliance Program (RBFCP) for the Nation?s approximately 4,000 recreational boat manufacturers.  These services shall consist of the following: (1) regular testing of recreational boats that are 20 feet or less in length, associated marine equipment, and specialized boats and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, (2) periodic inspections of boat manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with existing Federal regulations, and (3) engaging in educational outreach to recreational boat manufacturers regarding current regulations and available resources. Boats tested may be outboard (O/B), inboard (I/B), inboard/outboard (I/O), or manually powered.  The USCG does not test canoes, racing boats, airboats, or catamarans.  Regulations enforced through the RBFCP are defect notifications, boat identification, safe loading, safe powering, and level flotation for boats less than 20 feet in length.  The RBFCP also ensures compliance with the regulations for level flotation, electrical systems, gasoline fuel systems, ventilation, start-in-gear protection, and navigation lights.  Information collected from each factory inspection is recorded and maintained in the U.S. Government owned Manufacturer?s Identification Code (MIC) database.

BACKGROUND: The USCG is responsible for the oversight and enforcement of Federal Regulations for recreational boats and associated marine equipment.  The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, as codified into Title 46 United States Code Chapter 43, gave the USCG authority to establish comprehensive boating safety programs; authorized the establishment of National construction and performance standards for boats and associated equipment; created a more flexible regulatory authority concerning the use of boats and associated equipment to include all recreational vessels and expanded the Coast Guard?s jurisdiction to all United States navigable waters.  The first Federal regulations were adopted from industry standards published by the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) and other boating industry associations.  These minimum regulations covered defect notifications, boat identification, safe loading, safe powering, and level flotation for boats less than 20 feet in length.  Eventually, regulations for level flotation, electrical systems, gasoline fuel systems, ventilation, start-in-gear protection, and navigation lights were added. One element of oversight and enforcement is accomplished by physically testing boats and associated marine equipment for compliance with these Federal safety regulations.  The USCG acquires boats through a voluntary program where manufacturers provide boats free of charge to the USCG for testing.  The USCG also buys boats, both new and used, in the open-market for testing, targeting boats that are likely to fail one or more segments of the testing procedure.  A vital element of the RBFCP is to ensure that the most up to date information regarding recreational boat manufacturers is maintained in the MIC database.  This information is collected during each factory inspection and directly updated into the database.

REQUIREMENTS.

A. FACTORY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
1. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP).  The Contractor shall develop a SOP for use by the Contractor?s Compliance Associates from existing Factory Compliance Program materials. The Contractor shall specifically define categories of factory inspections including remote verification, physical verification, inspection, and education.  The level of detail of inspection/education visits are further broken down into categories that reflect the complexity of the manufacturer?s operation visited.  The Contractor shall outline methods of collection, packaging, and shipping of associated material samples collected at the direction of the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR).  The category and level of factory inspection must have a direct correlation with the effort and pricing by the contractor.  

2. FACTORY COMPLIANCE ASSOCIATE?S MANUAL.  The Contractor shall submit, for COTR approval, a comprehensive Factory Compliance Associate?s manual describing the procedures and requirements necessary to successfully perform a factory inspection while minimizing disruption to a manufacturer's operations.  The Contractor shall establish procedures to properly document findings from completed factory inspections. The completed manual will become the property of the Government.

3. BOAT MANUFACTURERS DATABASE (MIC).  Upon receipt, the Contractor shall review the Boat Manufacturers Database (hereafter referred to as the MIC database) and make recommendations for improving the database and manner in which it is maintained and updated.  The Contractor shall not institute any changes to the database without prior written COTR approval.  Upon receiving COTR approval, the Contractor shall make changes to the database.  This database shall be maintained by the Contractor, but shall remain the property of the Government.

3.1 The Contractor shall provide the Government full remote access to the MIC Database so that data entry, queries, and generate reports can be performed as needed.  The Contractor shall ensure that the MIC Database remains searchable by report number, case number, a six-digit CA identification number, factory name and Manufacturers Identification Code. 

4. COMPLIANCE ASSOCIATE TRAINING. Contractor shall submit for COTR approval a Compliance Associate certification and training program to assure Factory Inspectors are thoroughly familiar with pertinent regulations and voluntary standards.    The training shall also provide Compliance Associate?s with communication, record keeping and other skills that may be needed by Compliance Associate in order to present themselves in a professional and effective manner.  The certification training must be satisfactorily completed within thirty days of contract signing and before a Compliance Associate may conduct any factory inspections.  Before implementation, the re-certification training shall be approved by the COTR.  Documentation of each Compliance Associate?s initial certification and annual re-certification training shall be provided to the COTR.

4.1 The Contractor shall establish and implement an annual re-certification training program for Compliance Associates.  This training is to ensure that Compliance Associate?s remain current with federal laws and regulations as well as changing trends in the manufacture of recreational boats.  Training offered by organizations such as ABYC, the NMMA, Boat U.S., the American Bureau of Shipping or other sources that provide technical instruction in areas relative to boat structures and marine systems can be included as part of the re-certification training program. Before implementation, the re-certification training program shall be approved by the COTR.

5. FACTORY COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS. The Contractor shall provide all management, tools, equipment, and service required, to accomplish a minimum of 2000 factory inspections per year and provide the USCG with a case report on each inspection.  The Contractor shall schedule Factory Compliance Inspections in according to the size, complexity, and type of production, geography, and the manufacturer?s history of compliance.  Any manufacturer with a history of non-compliance will be given priority status for inspection scheduling.  Contractor shall ensure that all factories are inspected at least once within three years of the beginning of the contract (taking into account past inspections conducted on the previous contract).  Repeat inspections shall be scheduled with the approval of the COTR.

5.1 The Contractor shall develop and implement a formal means of soliciting feedback and addressing concerns of facility operators that are generated as a result of the Factory Inspection program. The Contractor shall develop a method to resolve conflicts arising from the Factory Inspection program.  The Contractor shall provide a summary of comments, conflicts and resolutions in the Factory Compliance Inspection Reports. 

5.2 The Contractor shall designate each factory inspection as a case with its own unique tracking number, which commences with the inspection and ends when all comments, conflicts, headquarter items, and other pending issues have been resolved.  The Contractor shall develop and implement a database to track the status and progress of all cases, and have a web-enabled interface that allows the USCG to access the database. 

5.3 The Contractor shall develop and implement a means of conducting telephone-only (remote) verifications.  Remote verification is typically utilized for low-volume or special order manufacturers that do not have a history of cited issues or campaigns (a campaign is a recall of a recreational boat model).

5.4 The Contractor shall develop a Factory Inspection case report format that provides essential details of each inspection and each segment of the regulations the manufacturer was subject to.  The format shall capture all aspects of current recreational boat manufacturing requirements.  The Compliance Associate shall complete this report in a draft format, which is to be completed during the factory inspections, and then enter the validated information into the computerized database no later than seven days after completion of each factory inspection. The Contractor shall keep the draft format report in a case file until it is replaced by the following report from a subsequent inspection.

5.5 The Contractor shall use a standard letter format to communicate Defect Notifications, corrections to future production boats and recalls to manufacturers.  These notifications shall include a method for constructive feedback from the manufacturer.  Each manufacturer shall have this letter mailed or delivered to their attention no later than twenty-one days after completion of each Factory Inspection.  

5.6 The Contractor shall, during the course of Factory Inspections, actively promote the voluntary boat testing program and other quality assurance programs administered by the USCG.  The Contractor may also be directed to participate in boating industry group meetings and conferences to provide details about the Recreational Boat Factory Inspection Program and any Lessons Learned during the course of the inspection program.  The Contractor may, at the direction of the COTR, be directed to disseminate information of special interest during Factory Inspections.

B. BOAT TESTING. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE NO GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT PROVIDED FOR BOAT TESTING. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL FURNISH ALL LABOR, TOOLS, MATERIALS, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR THE BOAT TESTING.

6. ASSOCIATED MATERIAL SAMPLE COLLECTION.  When requested by the COTR, the Contractor shall collect associated boat equipment material samples used by a particular manufacturer, and forward these objects to a testing facility specified by the COTR.  Purchase and other forwarding (shipping) expenses shall be cost reimbursable items.  

7. PURCHASING BOATS AND ASSOCIATED MARINE EQUIPMENT.  The Contractor shall recommend candidate boats and associated marine equipment for testing to the COTR.  The recommendation shall be based on the Contractor?s judgment that there is a high probability of non-compliance with 33 CFR 183 by the candidate boats.  The Contractor shall procure test boats and associated marine equipment after approval of the COTR.  Boats identified for purchase by the test program shall have standard equipment and accessories supplied by the manufacturer.  If optional equipment is offered which may have an impact on the compliance test results, or the probable resale value at the GSA auction, the COTR may authorize purchase of the optional equipment.

7.1 Purchased boats shall be obtained from a boat dealer, retailer, manufacturer, or, in the case of used boats, a private seller.  The Contractor shall schedule the purchase of test boats with consideration to the availability of cost effective means of transportation to the test site, availability of storage at the test site, workload at the test site, and resale market opportunities.

7.2 The Contractor shall not indicate to the seller in any way that the boat is being purchased on behalf of the USCG for compliance testing.  When circumstances of the purchase of the boat makes it necessary to disclose the purpose of the purchase, the Contractor shall examine the purchased boat to ensure that it is representative of boats available to the general public.

7.3 The preferred method of procuring test boats is to request that individual manufacturers volunteer boats for the test program.  The Contractor shall attempt to obtain a boat by requesting it be volunteered before any effort is made to purchase the boat.  When purchased, boats shall be obtained at the lowest possible price.  The COTR may authorize a higher price per purchase when necessary to obtain a boat with a high probability of failure to comply with Federal Regulations.  All purchasing records, bids, etc. shall be retained and provided to the COTR concurrent with monthly invoices for payment. 

7.4 The Contractor shall, at the direction of the COTR, purchase associated marine equipment used for recreational boating for testing.  The Contractor shall obtain all necessary documentation for associated marine equipment that clearly indicates the equipment is intended for use on a recreational boat.

8. TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF BOATS. The Contractor shall ensure that purchased boats are transported to the contractor?s test facility.  Transportation cost invoices, records, and quotations must be retained by the Contractor and provided to the COTR along with the Contractor?s invoice seeking reimbursement.

8.1. The Contractor shall ensure that volunteered boats are transported from the manufacturer to the test facility and returned to the manufacturer at the completion of testing.  Transportation shall be arranged at the lowest possible cost.  In lieu of transporting a volunteer boat, the Contractor may pay the manufacturer a fixed mileage rate and per diem for round-trip transportation of the volunteered boat from the factory to the test site.  The fixed mileage rate and per diem shall be at the current Government travel rate specified in the Federal Travel Regulations.

8.2. The Contractor shall be responsible for storage and security of boats and associated marine equipment before, during, and after testing.  The Contractor shall be accountable for all boats and associated marine equipment from arrival at the test facility to disposal and must maintain a verifiable inventory at all times.  Stored boats and associated marine equipment must be sheltered to preserve their characteristics and value.  The only suitable method for storing unsheltered boats and associated marine equipment is by shrink-wrapping with proper ventilation.  The shrink-wrap method of storage must be approved by the COTR prior to use.

9. TESTING OF BOATS, UNIQUE BOATS, AND ASSOCIATED MARINE EQUIPMENT.  The Contractor shall test all volunteered and purchased boats in accordance with the USCG?s Test Policy and Procedures Document.  The Contractor shall, at the direction of the Government, purchase and test unique recreational boats and associated marine equipment, including unique marine equipment intended to prevent drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning, propeller injury, or other injuries or casualties that may be associated with recreational boating.  In the event appropriate testing facilities are not available, sub-contracting to outside testing organizations such as UL and the SAE is acceptable.  Volunteered boats have priority for testing and retesting over purchased boats.

9.1 When a purchased or volunteered boat fails testing, the boat shall be re-tested within fifteen calendar days after corrections to the boat have been made.  Manufacturers that supply volunteer boats are responsible for all repair decisions and procedures regarding the preparation of failed boats and their re-test.  The Contractor shall not perform repairs on volunteered boats under any circumstances.  Contractor may make repairs on purchased boats if the manufacturer, after notification of test failure, fails to provide materials and labor necessary to adequately repair the boat in order to pass the re-test.  If a manufacturer is confirmed out of business, the Contractor may, at the direction of the COTR, make all necessary repairs to sell the boat at auction.  Boats undergoing re-test do not require a second 18-hour pre-soak.

9.2 When a volunteered boat fails testing, the manufacturer or person volunteering the boat may choose not to make corrections to the failed boat.  In this event, the Contractor shall forward a failed test report indicating that the boat was not re-tested at the direction of the manufacturer or owner.

9.2.1 If the manufacturer fails to respond to the Contractor?s first boat failure report and letter within thirty calendar days of mailing, the Contractor shall send out a second letter to the boat manufacturer, via Registered U.S. Mail, return receipt requested. 

10. REPAIR OF BOATS AFTER TESTING. To correct a non-compliance issue, the boat manufacturer can either provide the labor, materials, and tools to repair the boat at the Contractor?s facility, or make provisions to have the boat repaired at another facility.  The Contractor shall keep the COTR apprised of the manufacturer?s progress in repairing the boat with a paragraph in the monthly progress report.

10.1 If a boat is released to the manufacturer for repairs at another facility, the manufacturer is responsible for all costs associated with transportation of the boat.  The manufacturer must agree to return the boat to the Contractor?s facility for re-testing no later than thirty days after the boat has been repaired.  The Contractor shall obtain a signed receipt for the released boat.  The Contractor shall notify the COTR within seven calendar days after the boat has been released to the manufacturer and within seven calendar of the boat?s return.  If more than thirty days is required to repair the boat, the Contractor must notify the COTR of the expected return of the boat for re-testing.

11. POST TEST SALE OR DESTRUCTION OF BOATS. Purchased boats will be sold or destroyed after testing. 

11.1 The Government will be responsible for the reselling of the boats that have passed the compliance testing to the general public through the GSA via Open Auction sale at least one time per year.  The Contractor shall notify the COTR when the quantity of boats ready for auction reaches thirty. 

11.2 The Contractor shall provide auction facilities, including office space with telephone for GSA representatives two days preceding the auction as well as on the day of the auction.  This office space shall have only one open entrance with all other entranced locked in accordance with local fire ordinances.  The Contractor shall clean the boats three days prior to the auction.  The Contractor shall arrange for public inspection of boats two business days prior to the auction and through the day of the auction.  The Contractor shall load the boats onto the purchaser?s conveyance upon request.  Boats not sold will be retained in storage.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary clerical and administrative support associated with conducting an auction including spotting boats, recording bids, and operating the fork lift when necessary during the auction.

11.3 If elected by the COTR, the GSA may hold an online auction in lieu of a physical auction.  The Contractor shall support the online auction by making boats available for inspection in accordance with GSA guidelines. 

11.4 Boats selected for destruction shall be destroyed in a manner that prevents later use in the water.  The Contractor shall, at least ten days prior to the planned destruction date, request destruction approval from the COTR by fax or email providing details of the destruction method, place, and time.  The COTR will notify the Contractor of approval/disapproval of destruction within five calendar days of receipt of the Contractor?s destruction request.  For boats approved for destruction, the Contractor shall take one photograph of each boat before, during, and at the completion of destruction to serve as proof that the destruction was complete.  Each picture shall include a placard showing the boat number, hull identification, and date of destruction.  The Contractor shall be responsible for removal of destroyed boats to the local landfill.  The COTR reserves the right to witness any or all boat destruction work.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from ALL qualified small business firms (particularly 8(a), Women Owned, SBA Certified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 514210 ($6.5 million) which have the capability to perform the Maintenance and Fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support ? Household Components (HC).  The Contractor will be responsible for collecting editing and inputing data collected from Households.  The Contractor will also be responsible for survey weight and estimation variable development and construction as well as analytic file development, including documentation and codebooks. The contract will be performance based for an initial period of performance of three and one-half years with three one-year options.  

The primary objective of the MEPS HC is to provide high quality data that can be used to produce both point estimates as well as distributional estimates of health care use, medical expenditures, health insurance status and sources of payment for medical care.  In addition, the MEPS HC is designed to produce measures of health care quality associated with several high prevalence conditions.  The health care services use, medical expenditures, and health insurance data can also be linked to the demographic, employment, economic, and health status of survey participants.  The longitudinal feature of the MEPS HC permits analyses of transitions in health insurance coverage, health status, and other characteristics over a two year period. Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-HC which collects detailed information on health care use and payment for health care services from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.  In the MEPS HC, data are collected for each new sample (pane/ roundl) of households to cover a two-year period, and a new panel is started each year.  To produce health care estimates for a calendar year, data are combined across two distinct nationally representative MEPS HC samples.  More specifically, annual estimates are based on data from the first year of a current panel combined with data from the second year of a previous year?s panel.

Capable offerors must demonstrate they possess expertise in data collection (computer assisted and paper and pencil), statistical and analytical editing and imputation, survey weight and estimation variable development and construction, as well as analytical file development and documentation.  Respondents to this sources sought must demonstrate the following capabilities:  a) sample implementation and documentation; b) development of weights and variables for variance estimation; c) development of sampling unit data (geo-coding); d) development of materials and CAPI maintenance; e) interviewer recruitment and training for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4, and  Round 5; f) data collection for Round 1, Round  2, Round 3, Round 4, and Round 5; g) Spanish interviewer training and materials development; h) data processing; i) development of security plan; j) between round processing; k) forms control and receipt; l) data entry; m) data coding; and n) preparation and delivery of analytic files including archival versions of the full operational database, and point-in-time, full year use, full year use and expenditure, event, condition, jobs and a appendix files.  Offeror must also demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of how to develop an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC (Medical Provider Component ? to be a separate requirement) contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of CAPI applications, post data collection processing, and analytic editing and imputation tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data editing and imputation techniques proposed; the soundness of proposed weighting and variance estimation strategies and strategies to maximize survey response and minimize non-response bias; and  the soundness of the data management plan.  Examples of all of the above will be requested in the resultant RFP.   

The MEPS is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection (computer assisted and paper questionnaires) from household respondents of demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and sources of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment information.  In addition, respondents must demonstrate they have the expertise and experience in developing analytic files, including documentation of public use files, as well as survey weight and variance estimation development and construction, and analytical and statistical data editing and imputation. A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the contractor must demonstrate their capability to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.  Potential respondents are encouraged to visit the MEPS website at www.meps.ahrq.gov .  

Interested small businesses should e-mail their capability statements to Mary Haines, Contracting Officer at Mary.Haines@ahrq.hhs.gov no later than 12 noon eastern time on November 26, 2007. Organization must tailor their capability statements to this request and must include their small business designation (i.e. HUBZone, 8(a), Women Owned, etc) on the cover page.

<SUBJECT>PEO-IWS Library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise (SHARE)
<DESC>In August 2006, the Program Executive Officer, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO-IWS) established a library of combat system software and related assets for use by eligible contractors (both prime contractors and subcontractors) for developing or suggesting improvements to Navy Surface Warfare Systems.  The PEO-IWS library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise (SHARE) is presently being populated. The SHARE repository has recently been updated to Version 1.2, which incorporates several new enhancements.  These enhancements include an intuitive asset request ?wizard,? which helps users enter the request-specific information required for SHARE asset requests, and the ?My Requests? menu option that gives users the ability to monitor their asset requests as they cycle through the SHARE approval process. Additional enhancements include the ?My Approved Assets? menu option, an option that provides users the ability to view the titles for all SHARE assets for which they have been approved, and asset submission/request help files, which explain how to submit an asset and how to request an asset.   Finally, users who attempt to access the SHARE website, but who do not have an account, will now be provided the link required to initiate the account request process. As of October 2007, 60 assets and artifacts from the Aegis, Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), DDG-1000, and Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) programs are available in the SHARE library.  Recently, SHARE was populated with an updated LCS data model, DDG-1000 TSCEI 4.2.2 documentation and code (unclassified version), and the Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM) Sensor Adaptation Layer (SAL) Use Case Model.  PEO-IWS encourages all current Navy contractors and potential Navy contractors to register for access to the SHARE library to discover the assets it presently contains as well as to contribute assets that may be useful to the Navy and its contracting community in the future. Access to the library is restricted to contractors that are participating as a prime or subcontractor in active Navy contracts that include warfare or weapons system software maintenance or development.  Contractors that do not hold an active Navy warfare or weapon systems software or maintenance contract may be granted access by entering into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a Navy activity.  Access shall require ?Secret? facility and personnel clearance and a DD Form 254.  Access to, and employment of, SHARE assets shall be for Government Purposes Only.  Access is voluntary and there is no warranty associated with assets contained in the library. Those companies interested in registering for access to the library should visit and complete an on-line registration form at https://viewnet.nswc.navy.mil/pnb/share/share.nsf/.  To register for an account, click on the ?Click here to Request a VIEWNet account? link, select ?New Member? and ?SHARE? as your program of interest, and complete the form. This unclassified site provides a mechanism to discover library materials that are available within SHARE, as those materials are populated.  The site also hosts the license agreement and NDA that are required for obtaining library materials.  Library materials will be provided either on-line through access to the appropriate portion of the SHARE web site (classified or unclassified) or via delivery of physical media. The registration process for the classified portion of the site over SIPRNET (https://viewnet.nswcdd.navy.smil.mil) is the same as the unclassified portion above, except no digital certificate is required. [Note:  The unclassified site URL may not be accessible to your company due to IP filtering.  If that is the case, please contact the helpdesk at 540-663-4507 and provide them with the IP address(es) you will be using to access the site.] THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

<SUBJECT>REPAIR PARTS, AND REPAIR ALTERATIONS, FIELD CHANGES, OVERHAUL, REFURBISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE AN/SPS-67(V)5 RADAR, LESS OE-374/SPS-67(V)
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov   and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil .  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.  Offerors are encouraged to access information also available on the NSWC Crane Division web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm . NAVSURFWARCEN Crane Division desires to extend the ordering period of Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).N00024-05-G-4300 from 36 months to 60 months without raising the ceiling amount of the BOA. The scope of the BOA and the proposed modification thereto includes Repair Parts, and Repair Alterations, Field Changes, Overhaul, Refurbishment and Maintenance of the AN/SPS-67(V)5 Radar, less OE-374/SPS-67(V). A solicitation will not be issued as this is a modification to an existing BOA, which was awarded utilizing other than full and open competition procedures under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), One Source or Limited Sources to DRS Surveillance Support Systems, Inc., 6200 118TH Ave. North, Largo, FL,.  The proposed modification is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a) (2).  It has been determined that the Government requirement for these supplies and services can only be met by one manufacturer due to the contractor having unique qualifications to provide these supplies and services, since they are the design agent and sole producer of the AN/SPS 67(V) Radar System, less OE-374/SPS-67(V) Antenna Group  Thus, it is the only contractor currently identified as qualified to provide these supplies and services for this additional 24-month period.  Interested persons may identify t!  heir interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed BOA extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure subject equipment.  The POC is Deborah Frick, Code 0565ZN, at (812)-854-3707 or e-mail Deborah.frick@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number is HSCG85-08-Q-625159 is issued as a Request for Quotations.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20. The NAICS Code is 333618. The small business size standard is 1,000. This is an unrestricted procurement; all responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by the agency.  The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. The requirement is for component parts for parts for the 225 MINOR OVERHAUL KIT P/N WLP00320-002 onboard USCGC SPAR. The Form, Fit and Function of these parts must be exactly compatible with the existing WARTSILA SPLIT SHAFT SEAL and is critical to the safe operation of these cutters in extreme environments. It is the government's belief that only WARTSILA, or authorized distributors can provide these critical parts. Note: No Drawings, Specifications or schematics are available from this agency. That information is proprietary to WARTSILA LIPS INC and the Coast Guard is unable to supply any information other than part name and part number to prospective offerors. However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture these parts to OEM specifications are invited and encouraged to submit proposals. The following information must be provided to evaluate past performance: evidence of past successful manufacture to OEM specifications of all required parts, for the government, OEM, or secondary market, to include evidence of durability and that the parts met normal life cycle expectations without failures. Required parts are as follows:  CLIN 0001, 225 MINOR OVERHAUL KIT, P/N WLP00320-002, Place of delivery is USCGC SPAR, ISC, KODIAK, AK  99619.  Delivery of all items must occur not later than 24 NOV 2007 Quotations submitted in response to this solicitation must include: (1) Solicitation number HSCG85-08-Q-625159; (2) CLIN number, item name, part number, and unit/extended prices for all CLIN?s (3) proposed delivery after receipt of order in calendar days for each CLIN; (4) past performance information as required above (5) verification that each item shall be individually preserved, packaged, marked, bar-coded and shipped surface freight in accordance with best commercial practices; (6) taxpayer identification and Dun & Bradstreet (DUNS) number and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number; (7) Contractors full name, address, and telephone number.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).
