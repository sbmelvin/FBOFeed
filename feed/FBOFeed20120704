<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), develops and disseminate standards, measurements, and testing for interoperability, security, usability, and reliability of information systems, including cyber security standards and guidelines for Federal agencies and U.S. industry, supporting these and measurement science at NIST through fundamental and applied research in computer science, mathematics and statistics. ITL's standards development role is specified in the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106). The Secretary of Commerce approves standards that are developed by the NIST for Federal computer systems. These standards and guidelines are issued by NIST as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for use government-wide.
<p>NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling Federal government requirements such as for security and interoperability and there are no acceptable industry standards or solutions. For FIPS 201 and in response to Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD 12), ITL's Computer Security Division initiated a new program for improving the identification and authentication of Federal employees and Contractors for access to Federal facilities and information systems. FIPS 201, entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to satisfy the requirements of HSPD 12, approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and issued on February 25, 2005.</p>
<p>In consideration of technological advancement over the last five years and specific requests for changes from United States Government (USG) stakeholders, NIST determined that a revision of FIPS 201-1 (version in effect) was warranted. NIST received numerous change requests, some of which, after analysis and coordination with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and United States Government (USG) stakeholders, were incorporated in the Draft FIPS 201-2. In FY2011, the FIPS 201 revision draft was published and 247 pages of comments were received.</p>
<p>Continuing into FY2012, ITL's team of researchers, referred to hereafter as the PIV team, is concentrating on resolving the received comments with active interaction with the HSPD-12 stakeholders, publishing a second draft FIPS 201-2, and initiating the promulgation of the final FIPS 201 Revision 2. The PIV team is composed of six subject matter experts (SMEs), each leading and coordinating specific technical areas of the revision for FIPS 201. The technical areas include:<br />(1) Cryptographic capability of the PIV card and components;<br />(2) PIV card authentication mechanisms; <br />(3) Topology of the PIV Card; <br />(4) Change management; <br />(5) PIV card issuance and maintenance; and <br />(6) PIV card issuer accreditation and PIV card validation.</p>
<p>In order for the PIV team to be successful in its mission, NIST requires several support efforts in order to meet its publication requirements that include not only FIPS 201 Revision 2, and any future related updates but also updates to several FIPS 201 supporting Special Publications, as well as development of two new Special Publications. Completion of these tasks will allow NIST to meet an unusually large workload that will persist for one year while at the same time better focus on interaction with HSPD-12 stakeholders, and conduct the necessary procedures involved in promulgation of the final FIPS 201 Revision 2.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be for a period of one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541690 with a small business size standard of $14.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-12-RP-0071.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this acquisition.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately 15days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Sole Source Justification
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:champton@blm.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND NAME)
1.  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY (FAR 6.303-2(a)1)).  Bureau of Land Management, Vale District Office, 100 Oregon Street, Vale, Oregon 97918
2.  NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)2)). The Bureau of Land Management, Vale District Office, intends to sole source a firm fixed price services contract to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation to conduct an ethnographic study along the proposed and alternative alignments of Idaho Power Companys Boardman to Hemingway 500 kV Transmission Line Project (B2H).
Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation Cultural Resources Protection Program Department of Natural Resources 46411 Timine Way Pendleton, Oregon 97801
3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES (FAR 6.303-2(a) (3)). 
Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation will conduct an ethnographic study along the proposed and alternative alignments of Idaho Power Companys Boardman to Hemingway 500 kV Transmission Line Project (B2H). The goal of the study is to identify properties of historic, traditional, contemporary, or ongoing religious and cultural significance and importance within the as yet undefined B2H area of potential effects. Locations and information identified as traditional cultural properties are important for future management consideration under federal cultural resource protection laws by the Bureau of Land Management. This information is an important element of the tribal consultation requirements as identified in the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, as well as Executive Orders 13007 and 13175. 4.  IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY (FAR 6.303-2(a) (4)).  
This project meets the statutory exception under FAR 6.302.
Only one responsible source: when the supplies or service required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
5.  DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS (FAR 6.303-2(a) (5)).  
Knowledge of resources and resource uses, that are known only to members of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (or as incorporated in their oral histories), is known only to this source. Outside contractors would not have access to this information. This information is proprietary to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian. Given the protected nature of the data, the Government will obtain the information directly from the Tribal Ethnographer
6.  FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE FOR POTENTIAL SOURCES (FAR 6.303-2(a)6)). Publication of a notice of intent is required if the action is expected to exceed $25,000. 
This requirement was synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website via a Sources Sought notice on March 22, 2012.  The notice stated that the BLM intends to issue a purchase order to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) unless an offeror who could meet the Governments requirements responded to the notice.  Three (3) firms responded as interested vendors but the CTUIR clearly stated they would only allow their own ethnographers complete this work.
7.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)).  
The quote from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation was $140,101.80 is determined to be fair and reasonable for the completion of the four tasks as stated on the Statement of Work (SOW).  To determine whether CTUIRs quote was a fair and reasonable price, a request for a comparative quote was sent to Rucks Ethnographic Services utilizing the same SOW.  Rucks offer was $72,250.00.
The primary differences between the two quotes were:  (1) CTUIR utilized more personnel to complete the task compared to Rucks.  Rucks is utilizing one person to do the work compared to CTUIR.  CTUIR staff of seven includes specialists such as an ethnographer, a cultural anthropologist and an ethnobotantist, two cultural resource technicians, a program manager, and a principal investigator.  Since Task 3 required an ethnobotanical review the position requested for an ethnobotanist is required and justified.  (2) Fewer hours were budgeted for the study and a reduced amount of time allotted for the interview effort by Rucks in comparison to CTUIR.  Travel and interview stipends and time proposed to complete Task 2 was included in the CTUIRs cost proposal.  CTUIR hourly rates were found to be very reasonable when compared to other ethnographers rates under GSA contracts.  CTUIRs total quote for this study while greater than Rucks quote, factors in a reasonable amount of hours to thoroughly conduct the work.  
A similar contract was issued for the Shoshone Paiute Ethnographic study, L11PC00095, for 4,835,289 acres to be surveyed.  The cost per acre was $206,600.00/4,835,289 acres or $0.04 per acre.  The cost per acre using CTUIRs quote for the B2H projects is $0.03 per acre ($140,101.80/4,063,595) which compared to the Shoshone Paiute study is determined to be fair and reasonable.
8.  DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8))  A description of the market research conducted (FAR part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:
A sources sought announcement was posted on Fedbizopps.  Three (3) firms responded as aforementioned in paragraph 7.
Next, GSA E-library was searched doing an advanced search for ethnography services.  Several firms were located providing these services.  It was also determined in the market search through the internet that the number of firms or persons that do ethnographic services is small.  Research on previous BLM contracts for ethnographic services revealed only 6 awards in the past 3 years.  
9.  ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)).
The information to be gathered for this study is considered culturally sensitive to Native American communities. Tribal Elders do not freely give the information regarding properties of traditional use needed for this study. Disclosure of culturally sensitive information requires trust that the information will not be made public or misused. In addition, as per the National Historic Preservation Act and some of the other federal laws stated above, significant cultural sites are to be preserved and protected. One key component to protecting these sites is to keep them confidential. Because we are asking for information from Tribal Elders and other Tribal members and because CTUIR has their own ethnographer with an existing relationship with the Tribal Elders, this work will only be done by the CTUIR ethnographers.
10.  A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:
Three firms (STELLCO, Inc, Sylvester Lahren, and Epochs Past-West) responded to the synopsis but since this information is proprietary the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation they will not allow free and unencumbered access to the information from a private contractor or the BLM. 11.  ACTIONS, TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIER TO COMPETITION (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)).  
This is a one-time procurement and there are no actions to take.
12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION THAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE. (FAR 6.303-2 (a)(12)).   See certifications below. 
TECHNICAL AND REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION (FAR 6.303-1(b))

NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.
