AT&T's years as an international enterprise-level communications network service provider, along with their experience developing unique, proprietary methodologies, technologies and tools that detect, analyze, and present in a visual manner highly optimized for high-speed and accurate machine-assisted human analysis gives them the unique ability to provide an equivalent solution optimized for DISA's needs that can monitor and analyze the immense amounts of computer traffic and detect the millions of hacker attacks and denial of service attacks launched against DISA's Global Information Grid daily.  The Government intends to acquire this service using FAR Part 12 and 13.5.

<SOLNBR>231-OSP-005(02)

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks offers to continue operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups.

The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. The Government contemplates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with one base period and four one-year options.

Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow.org), and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (www.ibmtr.org). The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Send a pre-addressed envelope with your written request to the person above specified to obtain a paper copy of the request for proposals (RFP). Electronic copies of the RFP are not available.

<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure services,
on a sole source basis, from the Oregon Graduate Institute, School of Science and Engineering, to continue to characterize changes in flow, sediment input, salinity regimes and other physical factors, in support of the project "Estuarine Habitat and Juvenile Salmon -- Current and Historic Linkages in the Lower Columbia River and Estuary."  This research will help the Government develope future management strategies to improve the habitat opportunity for native juvenile salmon stocks.  The Government intends to negotiate solely with OGI because this is follow-on work to an existing contract to OGI.  Further, OGI scientists have worked
with the National Marine Fisheries Service for many years so have the necessary understanding of the project, and unique knowledge of the physical oceanography of the Columbia River estuary.  Any
interested concern which believes it can provide these services should send a qualifying statement to the above address by 12 April 2002.  The period of performance is expected to be five years from date of award. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract is anticipated. This is not a request for a competitive proposal.  This notice will be the only official notice of such solicitation.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the design, development, integration, and demonstration of perception-based autonomous robots that effectively operate in real-world environments and interact with humans and with other robots.  The key enabling strategy for this effort is the structured incorporation into the system of operator intervention, machine learning, and other techniques so that the system's autonomous capabilities can be iteratively and methodically improved, resulting in the evolutionary development of the revolutionary capabilities needed to support the Joint DARPA/Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) and other military transformational thrusts.  The software being developed under the Mobile Autonomous Robot Software (MARS) program will create significant, asymmetric, military advantage by enabling the pervasive employment of an entirely new class of unmanned, autonomous military systems.  By comparison, many current military systems are manned, with the human on-board the platform to provide all synchronous command and control (for both platform and payload operation).  This constraint imposes severe limitations on the acquisition, sustainment, and operational employment of these systems. The few unmanned systems currently employed are remote controlled.  This also engenders significant limitations including:  degraded system performance by inherently systemic, command and control latencies; limited operator performance by the quantity and quality of "telepresence" that can be provided to the remote operator; unreliable wireless command and control links; and extremely limited suitable spectrum bandwidth.  For the few, relatively autonomous systems, the state-of-the-art for software-enabled, autonomous control (such as waypoint flight control) is drastically inferior to the aggressive, human-enabled control exhibited by high-performance manned platforms, especially for aircraft.  This solicitation seeks proposals in the following research areas:  1. Structured software modules that will enable human operators to assist the robots through intervention so that the robot fully encounters its operating environment. As the level of robot autonomy increases, the MARS program goal is to double the average time between required operator interventions and reduce by half the average operator time required per intervention.  2. Learning and adaptation tools that impart knowledge through reinforcement, training, or emulation from operator inputs to evolve and improve autonomous perception and behavior.  3. Robot self-monitoring and the systematic assessment of perception and behavior performance in terms of quantitative metrics, in order to identify specific research objectives that carry the highest operational payoff in terms of increasing overall system performance.  4. Information exchange interfaces supporting interaction between robots and humans in various roles (teammates, bystanders, supervisors, operators, and adversaries).  5. Software components that capture an abstracted perception-based representation of a robot's "experience" as it moves through its environment, and that can use this representation to retrace the trajectory to provide retrotraverse, route replay, "go to point X", and other capabilities.  6. Sensor-based algorithms to enhance perception capabilities for sensing, interpreting, and "understanding" environmental features and humans.  7. Behavior software components and architecture structures to perform robot tasking and actions in the physical world.  MARS Robotic Vision 2020 supports the long-term MARS program concept of providing the foundational robotic system technologies necessary to achieve revolutionary capabilities that enable robotic situational awareness, "common sense," physical manipulation, and interaction, so that robots can serve as trusted team members performing tasks collaboratively alongside humans and remove humans from dangerous environments.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Proposed efforts should cover a 24-month period of performance.  The project schedule should include a kick-off meeting within a month of the award date, in-progress reviews at 6-month intervals, and multiple tests and evaluations during the final year. Up to $2.6 M may be available for the remaining FY2002 fiscal year.  Specific application/environmental domains will be concentrated on: outdoor on-road and off-road unmanned ground platforms; indoor mobile platforms; humanoids; and/or heterogeneous small ground and air platforms.  Existing platforms will be heavily leveraged, both hardware (mobility base, sensor and communications suites) and software (robot architecture and basis behaviors).  DARPA anticipates selecting up to four application/environmental domains forming the demonstration thrusts for the MARS program.  Proposers may affiliate their proposals with other submitted proposals contributing to the program goals stated above under the umbrella of a selected application/environmental domain thus forming virtual collaborative research efforts. To facilitate the evaluators understanding of the collective proposed objectives, each affiliated proposal should include the same overall application/environmental domain description and a top-level group schedule in addition to their own technical research objectives, schedules, and costs.  A summary of the current research projects and applications funded under the MARS program are available at http://www.darpa.mil/ito/research/mars/projlist.html.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA's release.  GENERAL INFORMATION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Technology Office (DARPA/ITO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Proposal, by accessing the URL below: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-15.  After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must submit the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and submitting it attached to the "original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Proposal.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/ITO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/ITO Technical - Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Details in Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word '97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-15, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy (Number) of  2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 4:00 PM (ET) Friday, May 17, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-15, MOBILE AUTONOMOUS ROBOT SOFTWARE (MARS) ROBOTIC VISION 2020 will remain open until 4:00 PM (ET) Thursday, April 3, 2003.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Thursday, April 3, 2003. While the proposals submitted after Friday, May 17, 2002, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-15 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and full proposal formats.

<CONTACT>Amelia Hayward, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-2921, Fax 732-323-2359, Email haywardag@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Metalite Aviation Lighting on a sole source basis for an Expeditionary Airfield Lighting Cable Kit (CABKIT), which will be a means of distributing power to all edge lights installed at an Expeditionary Airfield, allowing continuous support of both runway and taxiway operations.  A maximum quantity of 15 CABKITS will be procured under an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract.  The USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Program provides airfield lighting support to a myriad of airfield scenarios, such as remote landing zones, minimum operating strips, bi-directional runways with or without taxiways, and emergency back-up to permanently installed systems.  Currently, the USMC is utilizing the Expeditionary Airfield Minimum Operating Strip Lighting System (MOSLS).  MOSLS is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) system designed, manufactured and supplied by Metalite Aviation Lighting located in Birmingham, United Kingdom.  The two prime subsystems of MOSLS, the Minimum Operating Strip Lighting Kit (MOSKIT), Metalite PN S1N105017, and the Supplemental Airfield Lighting Kit, (SALKIT), Metalite PN S1N105016 both utilize the Omni-directional Runway Edge Light (OREL), Metalite PN S1N105168, as a core sub-element.  Each OREL is capable of operating from either its self-contained batteries or an external alternating current (AC) power source.  The CABKIT shall not contain its own power supply (e.g. generator), but shall be capable of distributing the proper AC power to the ORELs when connected to a variety of external power sources, to include the onboard MOSKIT generators.  The CABKIT must be completely compatible with the MOSKIT and SALKIT.  The Government does not own any engineering drawings or data rights for the MOSKIT, SALKIT, or their sub-components to include the OREL, and therefore cannot provide sufficient interface information to competitively procure the CABKIT.  Metalite Aviation Lighting, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), is the only company capable of providing the CABKIT.  A single CABKIT system shall be capable of supporting 356 ORELs, and consist of the smallest quantity possible of similar packages, each configured within an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Quadruple Container (QUADCON) shipping container.  Any single CABKIT package must possess, at a minimum, all of the capabilities to support 36 ORELs, each located 500 feet apart.  The remaining support shall be for 320 ORELs spaced 250 feet apart.  Each individual CABKIT package shall be self-sufficient for the number of ORELs it is to support.  For example, if a CABKIT is to support 100 ORELs, it must contain at a minimum, 100 interconnecting cables, 100 mating connectors (if applicable), 100 junction boxes (as applicable) etc.  An additional 500 feet of cable shall be provided with each CABKIT system in order to connect the first light to the circuit.  Cable reels shall be stowed within the CABKIT containers with the capacity of being removed or stowed by no more than two Marines.  In addition, the CABKIT shall contain a minimum of one portable cable reel stand to aid in the deployment and recovery of cables.  The CABKIT will be inspected and accepted at Source, and shipped F.O.B. destination (shipping charges borne by the contractor) to  Lakehurst,    NJ.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Responses should reference N68335-02-R-3047.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Coherent Laser Group of Santa Clara, CA, for (1) one MIRA OPO-SHG-Ring Basic Dual for NIST's existing Coherent Laser Group System to form a tuned, integrated laser light source.***Sole source determination is based on the need for this MIRA OPO-SHG-Ring Basic Dual to be completely compatible and interchangeable with NIST's existing system. The MIRO OPO SHG-Ring Basic Dual laser is used in a computer-controlled application where the software and hardware have already been developed. Deviation from Coherent Laser Group products would result in unnecessary and costly redesign of the existing hardware and software. Additionally the MIRA OPO SHG-Ring Basic Dual along with NIST's existing system will form a tuned, integrated laser light source. Keeping the elements of this system matched or tuned to each other is critical to maintaining a high level of frequency agility. Deviation away from these components would result in a reduced level of performance or in a total failure of the laser platform. Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 180 days after receipt of order.
***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515, and the size standard is 500 employees.***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 05,2002 will be considered by the Government.  ***A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUOTATION NA1341-02-Q-0315                 page 1 of 1
AMENDMENT #0003


The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to questions submitted and the response date remains the unchanged.

QUESTION:  In the original solicitation it does not mention the age of the container, however in one of your answers in the amendment 0002 it reads :If the container is fairly new (up to one year old), only chlorinated rubber will adhere....." Does This Mean that only containers accepted will be those one year old or less???? We have many containers which are built in China one time used only that were manufactured in years 2000 & 2001 thus older than one year, Are these acceptable??

ANSWER:  NIST's requirement is for containers that are considered new.  NIST's understanding is that this means that the container has been used only once to ship from its' country of origin to the United States.  As far as how long the container has been in the United States is probably insignificant, as long as it hasn't been reused for any other purpose, and is in new condition.  NIST's concern is that all the containers should resemble each other in appearance and construction, since they will be located in the same area.  

To address the painting issue one more time:  NIST's understanding is that most current manufacturer's are still utilizing chlorinated rubber paint due to the environment in which these containers are utilized.  Therefore, NIST requests containers that have been originally painted with chlorinated rubber paint.

Here are the answers to the questions.  Additionally the response date is extended to 3PM EST on 29 March 2002. 

1.    Your solicitation says that you need 9 -80GB ATA/100 drives. Do you need drives to fit into a 2U rack mount chassis, which is impossible.  [Nguyen, An]  8 internal drives and 1 spare.

2.    The 3Ware Escalade is the 7000 series ATA/133, the ATA/100 is a discontinued product.  The card accommodates either 4 drives or 8 drives.

[Nguyen, An]  I am aware of that the 7000 series are obsolete. Newer series 7810, 7850 are fine.  

3.  What is the level of raid that you are using and is it across the board for all drives that you are using?  [Nguyen, An]  RAID 5
Since you want 9 drives in each, what configuration in RAID do you want? Or is the end-user going to set up the RAID configuration? [Nguyen, An]   RAID 5

5.  Do you need a power supply?  Which power supply?  400?
[Nguyen, An]  Should be built-in by default. 400 should be good enough.  Is the power supply single or dual power supplies? [Nguyen, An]  Two is ideal, but at least one is needed.

6.  Do we need to integrate and test the unit prior to shipping? [Nguyen, An]  Of course, yes.

7.	Keyboard and mouse needed?  [Nguyen, An]  Yes...

9.	Want operators manuals for all parts inside server as stated in CLIN 0002?  [Nguyen, An]  Yes. 
  
10.  Part h. 2U Chassis - Are we assuming the 2U Rack mount is to hold 9 IDE Drives with no room for expansion?  [Nguyen, An]  Correct.

11.  If you do want more room for expansion, would you consider going with a 4U Rack mount since the most a 2U can hold is 9 drives? [Nguyen, An]  2U only.

12.  The 3Ware Escalade ATA/100 card holds up to 8 IDE Drives.
This card holds 8 drives. Am I to assume you want the 9th drive to be not RAID? Possibly to be the operating system drive? [Nguyen, An]   8 internal and 1 spare [Nguyen, An]  . OS: FreeBSD

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement


The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country.  This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.  Consistent with the urgency of this requirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative. While the initial identification of potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms capable of being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting sources relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment in December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, providing support for EDS screener training, and managing field service.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)  
The Transportation Security Administration has established the following anticipated subcontracting goals for this program (excluding the acquisition of EDS machines): 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business. 
As stated above, this announcement is seeking sources that can 1) compete at the prime contractor level and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal:  field equipment and provide training required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by December 31, 2002. 
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance sufficient to establish its capability to perform as the prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance to support the overall mission need as part of the team at the subcontractor level may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  For each of the various tasks cited above that you are capable of supporting, please provide detailed qualifications and references.  Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate.  
The capability statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov
not later than 1:00 PM EST on Tues, February 19, 2002.  All capability statements received from firms interested in participating at the subcontract level will be provided to the prospective prime contractors.  Statements exceeding the page lengths cited above or received after the due date will be discarded.  
The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS), through the Program Support Center (PSC), is seeking sources to provide monitoring of national plasma supply data.  The contractor shall monitor the capacity of the supply of plasma derivatives and their recombinant analogs to meet demand.

Background: Because of unanticipated shortages of plasma derivatives, and their recombinant analogs, members of affected patient communities and their advocates have repeatedly requested the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor the supply of plasma derivatives.  DHHS anticipates that this monitoring effort it will provide both producers and consumers of plasma derivatives with information that will be useful in anticipating and preventing product shortages, in addition to providing post marketing surveillance for the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use/overuse/ underuse of these products.  DHHS  hopes that this monitoring effort will promote additional Phase IV studies of the efficacy, and also the comparative efficacy of various treatments for these various diseases.

Specific Scientific Need:  The contractor shall recruit no less than 500 but no more than 2,000 individuals with diagnosed severe hemophilia A or B whose physician has prescribed a plasma derivative or its recombinant analog on at least a fortnightly (14-day) basis.  Due to the orphan disease status of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, the contractor shall maintain a disease specific patient registry which will allow patients to be recruited in a timely manner.   Individual participants  must be willing to report daily by internet, or by a telephone link to the internet, and provide the following information: 

1 	the amount, in milligrams or units, infused on that day; 
2 	the amount prescribed by a physician to take on that day; 
3 	the amount of product in their own possession; and
4 	a list of up to ten predetermined symptoms.   

The symptoms to be reported will be determined, and to the extent possible justified, by a Medical Advisory Board of the contractor?s choice.  

The contractor shall collect basic demographic information and baseline clinical information (which shall be updated every six months) on each study participant.

The contractor shall obtain prior approval and ongoing review of this human subject research activity from a qualified Institutional Review Board in conformity with 21 CFR 50 (found at http://www.valimation.com/Part 50_Downloads.html).  Individuals recruited by the contractor shall sign an informed consent form which has been approved by the contractor?s Institutional Review Board.  This form shall be held by the contractor and made available for inspection by the Project Officer during regular business hours for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of this contract.

Data shall be entered directly by the study participants into a central server to be provided by the contractor.  No data shall be stored on a computer which is not in the possession or control of either the contractor the government.  The contractor shall limit access to any computers as necessary to insure patient confidentiality.  Data shall be accessible in real time to the Project Officer and/or her/his designated staff.

The contractor shall employ a Study Coordinator who shall assist in the recruitment and retention of study participants. This Study Coordinator shall also review on each business day, the date that each study participant provided data for this study.  Software for this program will not be provided.  If the date is more than seven days prior to the date of review, the Study Coordinator shall attempt to make direct voice contact with the study participant on each of five subsequent business days. If  no response is received after such attempts, the Study Coordinator shall contact a third party individual (e.g. physician, parent or friend specified by the study participant) to determine why the participant is not reporting in a timely manner, and to take such steps as are possible or necessary to obtain resumed compliance.

The anticipated period of performance is a Basic period of September 30, 2002 through September 29, 2003, and four twelve month Option periods.

The closing date is April 9, 2002.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which demonstrates the ability to provide the specified services by the closing date, referencing 02T690128, attn:  Nickie McKenna, Contract Specialist.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.

<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS), through the Program Support Center (PSC), is seeking sources to provide monitoring of national plasma supply data.  The contractor shall monitor the capacity of the supply of plasma derivatives and their recombinant analogs to meet demand.

Background: Because of unanticipated shortages of plasma derivatives, and their recombinant analogs, members of affected patient communities and their advocates have repeatedly requested the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor the supply of plasma derivatives.  DHHS anticipates that this monitoring effort it will provide both producers and consumers of plasma derivatives with information that will be useful in anticipating and preventing product shortages, in addition to providing post marketing surveillance for the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use/overuse/ underuse of these products.  DHHS  hopes that this monitoring effort will promote additional Phase IV studies of the efficacy, and also the comparative efficacy of various treatments for these various diseases.

Specific Scientific Need:  The contractor shall recruit no less than 500 but no more than 2,000 individuals with diagnosed common variable or X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia whose physician has prescribed a plasma derivative or its recombinant analog on at least a fortnightly (14-day) basis.  Due to the orphan disease status of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, the contractor shall maintain a disease specific patient registry which will allow patients to be recruited in a timely manner.   Individual participants  must be willing to report daily by internet, or by a telephone link to the internet, and provide the following information: 

1 	the amount, in milligrams or units, infused on that day; 
2 	the amount prescribed by a physician to take on that day; 
3 	the amount of product in their own possession; and
4 	a list of up to ten predetermined symptoms.   

The symptoms to be reported will be determined, and to the extent possible justified, by a Medical Advisory Board of the contractor?s choice.  

The contractor shall collect basic demographic information and baseline clinical information (which shall be updated every six months) on each study participant.

The contractor shall obtain prior approval and ongoing review of this human subject research activity from a qualified Institutional Review Board in conformity with 21 CFR 50 (found at http://www.valimation.com/Part 50_Downloads.html).  Individuals recruited by the contractor shall sign an informed consent form which has been approved by the contractor?s Institutional Review Board.  This form shall be held by the contractor and made available for inspection by the Project Officer during regular business hours for a period of up to 2 years after the termination of this contract.

Data shall be entered directly by the study participants into a central server to be provided by the contractor.  No data shall be stored on a computer which is not in the possession or control of either the contractor the government.  The contractor shall limit access to any computers as necessary to insure patient confidentiality.  Data shall be accessible in real time to the Project Officer and/or her/his designated staff.

The contractor shall employ a Study Coordinator who shall assist in the recruitment and retention of study participants. This Study Coordinator shall also review on each business day, the date that each study participant provided data for this study.  Software for this program will not be provided.  If the date is more than seven days prior to the date of review, the Study Coordinator shall attempt to make direct voice contact with the study participant on each of five subsequent business days. If  no response is received after such attempts, the Study Coordinator shall contact a third party individual (e.g. physician, parent or friend specified by the study participant) to determine why the participant is not reporting in a timely manner, and to take such steps as are possible or necessary to obtain resumed compliance.

The anticipated period of performance is a Basic period of September 30, 2002 through September 29, 2003, and four twelve month Option periods.

The closing date is April 9, 2002.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which demonstrates the ability to provide the specified services by the closing date, referencing 02T690127, attn:  Nickie McKenna, Contract Specialist.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Mapping and National Wildlife Health Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Colorado are collaborating on a 3-year research project on the Geography and Pathways of WNV in the United States. Following the first year (2001) of the NWHC portion of the project involving field investigation of the role of migratory birds in disseminating WNV, about 4000 blood samples were collected from individual wild birds of nearly 120 species from 16 sites in 8 states. West Nile virus activity has expanded during the last 3 years from the original introduction site in New York City in 1999 to 12 states in the northeastern U.S. in 2000 and to 27 states throughout the eastern U.S. in 2001. Birds are the natural hosts for this virus and thus contribute to the local amplification of virus 
transmission and its geographical spread. As part of this geographical expansion was a significant increase in the number of birds and wild bird species affected by WNV. 
Because the rapid dissemination of WNV was facilitated by migratory birds, their role in the expansion and the species involved may be changing as the virus expands southward and westward. It is likely that modifications of the original experimental design are necessary to respond to the changing patterns in this disease. Therefore, results from the laboratory testing of the first year's blood specimens are critically needed in a timely manner to evaluate the selection of initial study sites and bird species to properly manage and direct the second and third years of the project.   The laboratory procedures require tissue culture production, experience in isolating and identifying viruses, newly developed serological test, specialized reagents, and advanced molecular testing equipment and procedures. A contractor with a certified biological safety level 3 facility is required. THIS NOTICE IS SEEKING SOURCES.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.  If interested, respond to this notice by April 12, 2002, via email to: edodson@usgs.gov or fax to (703) 648-7367 to attn: E. Dodson.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement The Department of Transportation  (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country. This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation   Security Act of 2001. Consistent with the urgency of this quirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative. While the initial selection of the potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on 
market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms interesting in being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting goals relating to this procurement. Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required  explosive detection equipment by December 2002. The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act. The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the 
supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, provide support for EDS screener training, and life cycle maintenance. (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and   certified firms that manufacture such devices.) The Transportation Security Administration has established the following subcontracting goals for this program: 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service  Veteran-owned small business. This announcement is seeking sources that can 1) participate as the prime contractor and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal: field equipment and human resources required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by November 17, 
2002. Any firm interested in being prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above. Any firm interested in being a subcontractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) 
that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above. For each of the various tasks cited above that you are interested in, please provide detail qualifications and references. Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate. The capability 
statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov no later than 1:00 on Thursday, February 19, 2002. All received capability statements will be provided to the prospective prime contractors. Statements exceeding two pages or received after the due date will be discarded. No additional information is available at this time. The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency. Those who are chosen, through competitive processes based on ideas and solutions, with consideration of cost and risk, will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<SUBJECT>D -- Enterprise Metadata Repository System (EMRS).
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

1.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information requested.

2.  Although "proposal" may be used in this Request for Information, your response shall be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.

3.   This request for information is issued for the purpose of: 
 
a.  Obtain technical solutions from software development experts for an Enterprise Metadata Repository System (EMRS). 

b.  Requirement:  A system requirement exists that will allow all software developers and users easy access to existing pertinent logical and physical metadata required to more rapidly develop software while ensuring that the developers are following all data standardization compliance requirements.  The EMRS is the business application supporting geologically separated units.  The EMRS will support the system users, designers, maintainers, and integrators of software applications and system developments with consistent, high quality metadata.  The EMRS has two needs to complete: 1) Identify explicit requirements of the new system to meet its goals and 2) Develop or buy an unclassified automated information system (AIS)/data repository with web-based access for all units. Access for users will be read-only for the logical, physical, and process model metadata, interface and XML data, and report generation. The EMRS must support documentation, analysis, and management of legacy information system metadata and interface infrastructure metadata; and development, standardization, and management of proposed information system metadata. The EMRS must have in-house read/write capability for six Data Management office personnel to maintain the EMRS repository metadata. The EMRS will store approximately 150 legacy, current, and future automated information systems.  Users/tenants require both standard and comprehensive ad-hoc reports with the capability to tailor output to specific project requirements.  Web-based users require on-line submission capability for proposed creation or modification of EMRS information. Required storage space is ten gigabytes on a server. EMRS web-based access must support 30 to 50 concurrent users and provide direct-access for six in-house metadata maintenance users. The EMRS must use the af.mil URL.  The EMRS must provide DOD-approved data standards, and approved and emerging user data standards, including Logical and Physical model metadata and process model metadata. The EMRS must provide automated two-way information exchange capability with applicable DoD metadata information systems, including acceptance of the monthly updated MS Access files from the DoD Data Dictionary System (DDDS) and the DoD XML Registry System. The system must also accept imported MS Excel spreadsheets from the Defense Data Architecture (DDA) models.  The system must be able to create the AETC and DOD Standard Data Proposal Package for input into the DDDS.  The system must be able to flag data elements to all associated logical data models and DDA models containing the same data elements.  This office will provide the standardized Fully Attributed Logical Data Model (FALDM) for the EMRS.  If the technical solution is to develop the system, the physical schema for the system shall be developed from the FALDM.  If the technical solution is to use existing COTS, the COTS database must be mapped to the FALDM.

<SUBJECT>58 -- PUBLIC SAFETY LAND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS PARTICIPATION IN A MODERATED PANEL DISCUSSION
<DESC>The Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) Program will sponsor its 16th regional symposium in Portland, Oregon, June 4-6, 2002.  (See www.pswn.gov or call 1-800-565-PSWN for additional information on the symposium.)  This symposium, like earlier ones, is intended to stimulate networking and firsthand information exchanges about developing interoperable public safety land mobile radio (LMR) communications systems.  Past symposiums have attracted local, state, federal, and tribal public safety officials who share information about systems planning, site acquisition, funding, spectrum, and other relevant information.  The PSWN Program envisions panel discussions at the conference to include a moderator and several subject matter experts with the capability of discussing and answering questions from the moderator as well as from the audience.  This panel will discuss the ability of manufacturers of LMR radio communications equipment to support public safety missions.  This activity is to be a moderated panel discussion that will have participation by all interested equipment vendors that manufacture radio communications equipment commonly used by public safety.  The session is planned for June 5, 2002 from 8:00-9:00 a.m.  The panel moderator will be a member of the public safety community.  The moderator will stimulate discussion among the panel participants through questions including, but not limited to, vendor products, status of research and development activities, and compliance with published standards.  A limited number of spaces are available for vendor participation.  Vendors will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  The PSWN Program believes that manufacturers of LMR equipment typically used by public safety entities will find this panel discussion applicable to their respective businesses.  The participating vendors will not be allowed to provide presentations, individual briefings, or marketing pitches, and sales rhetoric will be discouraged.  Information exchange and dialogue will take place only in the form of responses to questions posed by the moderator or symposium attendees to vendor panelists, who will each be allowed to respond in kind.  Vendor marketing materials such as banners, brochures, slick sheets, actual equipment, etc., will not be allowed in the room where the symposium is taking place or in the general vicinity of the room (e.g., registration area).  The PSWN Program will not provide transportation, per diem, or other resources or support for vendors participating in the panel discussion.  Only one representative from each participating vendor will be allowed to sit on the panel.  Equipment manufacturers desiring to send a representative to participate in the panel discussion should make their request via e-mail (preferred), by fax, or in writing to: Mrs. Carole Kirsch, PSWN Program, P.O. Box 3926, Fairfax, VA 22038, (E-mail cakirsch@earthlink.net, Phone: 703-279-2006, Fax: 703-279-2032).  Requests must specify company and participant by name, and provide the following point-of-contact information: business mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and email.  Requests should be received no later than May 3, 2002.  Participation in the panel will be confirmed by May 10, 2002.
