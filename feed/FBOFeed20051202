APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals !  received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 m ay be considered non-compliant.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer.  To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID a!  nd password into ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA’s homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.

<DESC>With this Partnership Opportunity Document, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center seeks a partner who can define a Sail Imaging Metrology System (SIMS) for the concept definition or Phase A study of the ST9 Solar Sail mission. The selected SIMS partner will work closely with the Solar Sail Concept Definition Study Team during the concept definition study and will provide inputs describing the SIMS for the Solar Sail Concept Definition Study Report. The SIMS is intended to provide: 1) a “global” image of the sail during and after deployment; 2) a high-resolution image of any specific region of the sail; and 3) measurement of static and dynamic shape of the sail.  A SIMS concept that meets minimum measurement requirements (see Table 1 attached) and tight resource allocations (see Table 2 attached) is needed. Approaches for achieving elements of the full performance measurement within resource allocations are also sought (see right-most column in Table 1 attached). Potential partners must respond with proposals for space imaging systems based upon mature hardware previously developed or currently in development.  They may indicate reliance on NASA-provided extraction of shape data from the images the SIMS provides or propose alternative methodology for determining sail shape.   Potential partners must specify the dimensions of required booms or other structure. At their option, they may also specify a particular boom or other structural solution.  The response for this POD is due by 6:00 pm EST on January 6, 2006.  An electronic PDF document may be sent at this time to Robin.Mauk@nasa.gov  This solicitation/synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.	An ombudsman has been appointed. See Internet Note “B”.	The documents for this partnership opportunity will be in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for historical paper data capture and conversion services under the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) initiative.  We will solicit the proposed acquisition under Full and Open Competition procedures.  We will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal and price quotation.

The resulting performance-based contract will enable us to accurately capture (image) and convert the paper records of more than one million active or former (not retired) Federal employees.  By procuring capture and conversion services from an existing, proven capture and conversion provider, we will be able to convert, with minimal implementation time and risk, a large volume of historical data that can be used by new systems to deliver relevant, accurate, and prompt services to retirement program participants.

We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a teaming effort.  The chosen offeror will provide services to capture and convert historical paper records into an electronic format to support our administration of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement Systems (FERS).  We will determine the total set of capabilities to be provided based upon your submissions and we will weigh the costs, benefits, and risks of your submissions.

Your submissions must include the following services, which we may purchase at our discretion:  (1) Document retrieval and tracking, (2) Document transport and preparation, (3) Document imaging and indexing, (4) Document reassembly, (5) Document disposal, (6) Data conversion, (7) Image and data storage, (8) Image and data retrieval, and (9) Image and data transfer.

We wish to purchase the services described in this solicitation under terms and conditions similar to those that typically apply to similar purchases in the private sector.  However, we have unique Federal Government constraints and we must ensure that the services we purchase meet the Federal retirement systems’ unique characteristics as we will describe in the RFP.

Place of Contract Performance:  The paper records are located at our secure storage facility in Boyers, Pennsylvania.  You will be responsible for retrieving records to be captured and converted from this facility.  We will determine the place of performance, for capture and conversion services, based on your submission.  However, the place of performance must not exceed the boundaries of the continental United States. Offshore personnel and facilities are prohibited for this procurement.

Duration of the Contract Period:  The period of performance includes a base period plus two (2) or three (3) one-year option years.  The base period will equal implementation, must not exceed 6 months, and we would prefer that implementation is completed in less than six months.  We prefer to complete the entire capture and conversion effort within the shortest period possible and that it take no more than two years.  If you believe it is advisable and have compelling reasons for using a third option year, you must describe your rationale within your RFP response.  The fourth option year is available as a contingency only, which will be negotiated by us and you, if needed.  You should not assume that a fourth year will be necessary. 

Preproposal Conference and Site Visit:  On October 20, 2005 you will have an opportunity to tour the storage facility at our Boyers, Pennsylvania location during the preproposal conference and site visit.  You are strongly encouraged to attend this preproposal conference and site visit.  This is the only opportunity available for you to tour our unique facilities.  Attending the preproposal conference and site visit will help you learn more about our storage facility and will help you prepare a stronger response to this procurement.  If you plan to attend the preproposal conference and site visit, you must email David Shively, by October 14, 2005, and include the following registration information:  (1) Your Company Name, (2) Single Company Point of Contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address), (3) Your Company Website, (4) List of Attendees (total number of your staff expected to attend the conference, first and last names, titles, social security numbers, U.S. citizenship status (yes or no), telephone, fax, email, and mailing addresses), (5) Your Business Classification Code, and (6) One-page executive summary of your Company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in MS Word format.  You will be limited to two participants at the preproposal conference and site visit.

After we receive your registration information, we will email your Company Point of Contact a preproposal conference and site visit Information/Registration Packet.  The packet will include information related to directions to our facility, hotel/lodging, transportation, special accommodations, and an example agenda for the site visit.  Note:  We will be reserving a block of hotel rooms for all site visit attendees.  The packet will provide you with instructions for notifying us of the hotel at which you are staying.

We anticipate issuing the solicitation on or about October 3, 2005.  Proposals will be due on or about November 16, 2005.  We will award to the responsible offeror whose proposal we determine provides the best value to the Government.  Our anticipated contract award date is April 1, 2006.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Nicole Humphrey, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4379
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-06-00074 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2006-06.  This procurement  is being solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.  The NAICS and small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  More than one contract may be awarded from this RFQ, via the issuance of a fixed price purchase order. STATEMENT OF WORK: Energy Efficiency Policy and  Best Practices Analysis and Outreach - BACKGROUND: There are significant cost-effective opportunities to reduce emissions from the electricity sector.  Some opportunities arise from improving the efficiency of electricity use and supply.  EPA's Climate Protection Partnership Division and Energy  STAR program exists to promote these opportunities, but continues to experience disincentives and other barriers in the electricity policy arena as the program seeks to increase energy efficiency.  End-use energy efficiency opportunities are widespread with residential, commercial and industrial  customers. While offering substantial emissions reductions and economic benefits, energy efficiency technologies and approaches have not been implemented on a wide scale in the U.S. because of financial, informational, and institutional barriers.  A major part of this requirement deals with  assessing the opportunities for addressing regulatory and informational barriers, and undertaking program activities to overcome the identified barriers. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this statement of work is to provide technical support to the Climate Protection Partnerships Division in conducting  research, financial and technical analysis and outreach on effective business cases for cost-effective utility investment in energy efficiency (EE) as a strategy to lower natural gas prices, increase system reliability, and mitigate the environmental impacts of energy.   This statement of work will  involve implementing support for, among other things, a new effort called the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which will bring together leaders from the utility industry, state and federal agencies, and other stakeholders to develop solutions that increase support for EE and clean DG.  A description  of the National Action Plan is attached to this SOW as Attachment A for additional background. SCOPE: This statement of work involves four Tasks: (1) facilitating communication between the COR and the contractor by conducting kick-off and other regular meetings; (2) conducting research and  developing business case reports to address utility incentives and decoupling policies; (3) conducting research and developing business case reports to address rate design approaches that maximize cost-effective energy efficiency; and (4) conducting research, analysis and documentation of "best  practice" model energy efficiency (EE) programs in a variety of end-use sectors and portfolio approaches.   Task 1. Communication: The contractor shall attend a kick-off meeting by phone with the COR and other experts at EPA.  In addition to the kick-off meeting, the contractor should plan on  monthly status calls with the COR to provide updates on research and analyses, as well as budget and other issues as they arise. Task 1 Schedule of Deliverables: Kick-off meeting - Within 2 weeks of contract award,  Monthly status meetings - The first week of each month thereafter Task 2.  Research and Development of Business Case Reports for Utility Incentives and Decoupling Policies Energy efficiency and clean DG have been shown to increase system reliability, reduce peak power demand, reduce consumer energy bills, and reduce environmental impacts.  However, despite these proven  benefits, a significant amount of cost-effective EE investments exist.  This is due in part to a key barrier:  typical utility incentive structures reward utilities for maximizing their sales-thereby creating a disincentive to EE.  Under this task, the contractor will receive direction from the EPA  COR to complete research and analysis requests.  The product of these requests may be used to support planning of business cases developed for Energy Efficiency Action Plan.  This may include, but is not limited to, conducting research on existing and planned utility decoupling/incentive policy  efforts, developing hypothetical decoupling and incentive scenarios that analyze financial outcomes for different utility types (public, private, restructured, regulated, etc.) and reviewing or preparing text for business case reports.  For budgeting purposes, the contractor should expect up to  five (5) research requests resulting in 10-12 page reports with technical appendices.  Upon receiving notification from the COR, along with additional background information about the specific analysis or report, the contractor shall develop a brief write-up that discusses the proposed approach to  develop the report or analysis.  After COR review and approval of the approach, the contractor shall conduct the research and develop a report that discusses the results of the research, including lessons learned and recommendations for next steps.   Task 3.  Research and Development of Business  Case Reports for Rate Design Strategies to Increase Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency.  Another key barrier to advancing cost-effective energy efficiency is the failure of customers to see the actual utility costs to provide them with electricity.  Some regions are successfully using rate designs  such as time-of-use or seasonal rates to more accurately reflect the cost of providing electricity and to encourage customers to consume less energy.    Under this task, the Contractor shall collect, review and document lessons learned from a variety of time-of-use and other time dependent pricing  experiences; develop business cases for rate design strategies; and recommend strategies that encourage greater use of energy efficiency.  For budgeting purposes, the contractor should expect up to four (4) research requests resulting in 10-12 page reports with technical appendices.  Upon receiving  notification from the COR, along with additional background information about the specific analysis or report, the contractor shall develop a brief write-up that discusses the proposed approach to develop the report or analysis.  After COR review and approval of the approach, the contractor shall  conduct the research and develop a report that discusses the results of the research, including lessons learned and recommendations for next steps.   Task 4. Research and Documentation of "Best Practice" Energy Efficiency Program Efforts.  Another key barrier given for slow adoption of energy  efficiency is a lack of knowledge about the most effective and cost-effective energy efficiency program options.  However, many states and utilities are successfully operating energy efficiency programs across end-use sectors and customer classes including residential, commercial, industrial,  low-income, and small business.  These programs employ a variety of approaches, including:  providing public information and training, offering financing and financial incentives, allowing energy savings bidding, and engaging performance contracting.   Under this Task, the Contractor shall collect,  review, and document best practices for operating successful energy efficiency programs at a portfolio level  -- addressing issues such as assessing energy efficiency potential, screening energy efficiency programs for cost-effectiveness, and developing a portfolio of approaches.  They shall also  collect, review and document best practices for successful energy efficiency programs across end-use sectors, customer classes, and a broad set of approaches.  Finally, Contractor shall document the political and administrative factors that lead to program success.  For budgeting purposes, the  contractor should expect up to ten (10) reports of 4-8 pages each documenting key EE programs.  Upon receiving notification from the COR, along with additional background information about the specific analysis or report, the contractor shall develop a brief write-up that discusses the proposed  approach to develop the report or analysis.  After COR review and approval of the approach, the contractor shall conduct the research and develop a report that discusses the results of the research, including lessons learned and recommendations for next steps.  Tasks 2-4 Schedule of Deliverables.  Specific analysis/research tasks - On an as-needed basis, after receiving direction from the COR. Draft reports - 3 weeks after receiving direction from COR, Final report - One week after receiving EPA comments, Additional research/updates to report - Upon request from the COR.

<DESC>This is the presolicitation notice for the Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT) program. The solicitation will be released on or about the week 0f 19 Dec 2005 and close on or about 18 February 2005 Jan 2006. The scope of this program is to provide the products, services, and development required to support Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT). The Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology program will sponsor new technology developments and demonstrations for solid rocket propulsion.  The desired technologies span all areas of application for solid rocket motors (SRMs), including ballistic and space boost, post boost propulsion and tactical motors.  The development activities to be undertaken will also include advanced technologies for predicting and monitoring the remaining service life of solid rocket motors as well as for the modeling and simulation functions to design and assess the performance of solid rocket motors. Research areas 1 through 5 are Applied Research or Advanced Research Technology efforts.  Proposed work under research areas 1 through 5 must address the technology developments required to achieve Phase III IHPRPT and Phase II TSSS goals.  The overarching strategy of this BAA involves the use of a 5-year open-ended solicitation spanning six (6) research areas.  The current solicitation is a call for the first 5 research areas of the BAA. The intent is to eventually award at least two (2) Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts encompassing all of the first 5 research areas. The period of performance will be 5 years. All responses to the current call for proposals relative to IDIQ contracts covering Research Areas 1 through 5 must include qualifications for the contractor’s capabilities in all five research areas.  The government is not seeking proposals for capabilities in one, some, or most research areas, but for all five. The contract proposals will be evaluated utilizing the Peer Review Process, in accordance with FAR 6.102-(d)(2). Each proposal will be evaluated for technical capabilities; specialized experience, education, and training; previous relevant technical performance; and management strategy and capabilities. Each selected proposal resulting from this initial call will result in the award of an IDIQ contract.  Each IDIQ contract shall provide a minimum guaranteed amount of $250,000.00 of work to be accomplished under that contract during the lifetime of the contract. All work will be defined in individual Task Orders issued under the various IDIQ contracts.  This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  It has been determined that limitation of foreign participation is appropriate. Foreign owned, foreign governments, or foreign nationals are prohibited from participation as a prime or sub-contractor in this effort.  In addition, the Export – Controlled Data Restrictions clause AFMC FAR 5352.227-9000, and Visit Request by Foreign-Owned or Controlled Firms clause AFMC FAR 5352.227-9002 shall be included in any resulting contract and flowed down to subcontractors at all tiers. This prohibition does not preclude the contractor or subcontractors from procuring required raw materials from foreign sources, but the foreign source is not permitted to participate in any of the technical development effort awarded under this announcement. This acquisition is full and open competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>D--ARFORGEN SYNCHRONIZATION TOOL
<SOLNBR>W911SE06ARFORGEN
<RESPDATE>121605
<ARCHDATE>02142006
<CONTACT>Yvonne M. Wimberly, 404-464-1408
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: The Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) has a requirement to establish and develop a predictive synchronization tool in order to assist the Army in generating future force needs while addressing the impact on the present force pools.  The Army Force Generation ( ARFORGEN) is a force management process that leverages modular unit designs and operational cycles to provide sustained deployment capability of operationally ready units.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify potential sources capable of satisf ying this requirement.    It is imperative that the potential offeror demonstrates the ability to meet the objectives set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and meets the milestones identified in paragraph three (3) of the PWS. Responses shall c learly indicate the product/series that the firm has developed/possesses, and discuss the data rights associated with the product/services   It is anticipated that the Government will seek a limited use rights of the delivered application.  The Government anticipates it will solicit this requirement on a Firm-Fixed Price basis.  Payments to the Contractor will be performance-based payments, based upon successful completion of the contract milestones.  Interested Offerors must respond to this announcement no later than COB on 16 Dec 2005, by providing firm, quality and quantifiable information on the acquisition approach and model to be used, and must demonstrate how milestones will be met and capabilit y of performance. PWS AS FOLLOWS: G3/5/7 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) ARFORGEN Synchronization Tool  1.  Background: Within FORSCOM, the G-3/5/7 has general staff responsibility for directing and supervising training, mobilization and deployment of FORSCOM units.  This includes collective and joint training, operations, joint operations, combat development, force managem ent and force structuring.  Additionally, the G-3/5/7 establishes training policy and oversees training of Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve units.  Further, the  G-3/5/7 directs the training readiness of all FORSCOM units to ensure their capability to deploy in support of theater contingencies worldwide.  Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) is a force management process that leverages modular unit designs and operational cycles to provide a sustained deployment capability of operationally ready units.  ARFORGEN will synchronize people, equipment, training, res ources and formations over time to satisfy the requirements regional combatant commanders will place on the Army.  The ARFORGEN process focuses on unit level readiness.  Individual units undergo a structured progression of increased readiness over time, cu lminating in full mission readiness and availability to deploy--their operational readiness cycle.  Utility of the entire force is maximized through allocation of the correct mix of resources to requirements.  The necessary manning, equipping, resourcing, and training processes are synchronized to generate ready forces from all components to achieve a sustained deployment capability and a capability to surge forces for other requirements.  To facilitate the ARFORGEN process, an automated capability is required. FORSCOM researched commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software to validate the feasibility of an automated ARFORGEN capability.  The outcome of the research was a Global Predictive Capab ility (GPC) prototype based on manufacturing COTS software.  G3/5/7 FORSCOM directed immediate enhancements of the GPC prototype to meet ARFORGEN needs.  The enhancements became the ARFORGEN Synchronization Tool (AST) prototype.  This AST prototype must be  rapidly expanded into an Army system of record to meet ARFORGEN implementation milestones which began in October 2005.  Immediate functional modifications are required by February 2006 to support the ARFORGEN worldwide Synchronization Conference scheduled  for March 2006. 2. Scope:  AST is defined herein as data input to a simulation engine, data output to a data base and the production of Gantt charts.

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT REPLACES THE SYNOPSIS THAT WAS POSTED ON JUNE 20, 2005 IN ITS ENTIRETY.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security intends to release a Request for Proposal with a Specification to acquire swimsuits in a two piece design known as a tankini style.  The swimsuit will be part of the recruit training uniform for all military USCG female personnel.  The suit shall  provide sufficient modesty and a professional appearance  appropriate for use in a military training setting.  The swimsuit shall be durable enough to provide for normal wear during training and for use during assignments beyond basic recruit training.  The top shall have a full front liner with an attached foam support cup bra with under bust elastic.  The brief shall have a full front liner panel, an encased elastic waistband and encased elastic leg openings.  The front and back joining seams (side seams) of the top and brief shall be safety stitched.  The fabric shall be navy blue and approximate the shade of the sample provided by the USCG.   The swimsuit’s fabric and content must conform to the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3787, American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) Method 135, AATCC Method 61, AATCC Method 8, AATCC Method 107, AATCC Method 15, AATCC Method 106, AATCC Method 129 and AATCC Method 16. Each offeror shall be required to certify that the basic material, lining, bra support, elastomeric fabric, and thread conform to the requirements specified.  Moreover, each bidder shall provide a copy of the results of textile testing performed by an independent laboratory in accordance with the ASTM and AATTC standards previously stated. This requirement will be procured as a commercial item using the commercial item procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The USCG will utilize a down-selection procurement process.  In Phase One of the process, the USCG will award up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts using the source selection process.  One of the awards will be totally set-aside for small businesses. Subsequent to award, delivery orders will be issued under each contract for the guaranteed minimum quantities.   In Phase Two of the process, after the contracts (basic award and initial delivery orders) are awarded in Phase One and all deliverables have been accepted (compliant with all contract requirements) by the USCG on a specified date, the deliverables will be validated against the contractor’s initial respective proposal.  At the conclusion of Phase Two, the overall single best value will be selected as the full tankini production contractor.  The goal of this process is to determine the best overall buy for the USCG.  The NAICS Code is 315239 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The USCG anticipates posting the RFP on the Federal Business Opportunities Website in December 2005.  All questions concerning the synopsis should be directed to Arita Tillman, the Contract Specialist at atillman@comdt.uscg.mil and Linda B. Dearing, the Contracting Officer at ldearing@comdt.uscg.mil

<DESC>The full solicitation is posted on www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  No solicitation will be posted on www.fbo.gov.  Interested vendors should pull the solicitation from www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  Any questions or concerns please contact the POC via e-mail.  

Additional comments

What is the preferred status of the machines, USED or NEW?  New, but used is fine if it is low hour and dealer certified.

Which is the preferred model for the dozer D6, D7 or D8?  D8

Regarding item 0002 for All Terrain 5-ton Front End Loader, I assume this is a telescopic Handler with bucket attachment, please confirm.  No.  I attached a picture of what type of equipment we are looking for.  Front end loader with forklift attachment and bucket attachment.

1. Is there any objection if we sell to you some used Bulldozer in our inventory- 2005?  No, as long as like new with manufacturer certification.

2. Can you specify the prefered tons for the Lowboy Trailers?  Needs to be able to carry the equipment in the solicitation (2 dozers, one front end loader).

3. Because of the risk of operating in Iraq at this time, let us know if you prefer a training to be arranged for the 10) operators and five (5) mechanics in Jordan?  Not an option...training is done on site. 

can you please inform us " what is the capacity of the Low Boy Trailers"?  Needs to be able to carry the equipment in the solicitation (2 dozers, one front end loader).

<DESC>THIS IS A DRAFT BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) ONLY.     The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.     This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.     The intent of this DRAFT BAA is to obtain market research on the details for the final announcement.     Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.     Information will be released in sections.     Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.

The Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.   The Air Force is initiating major efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies in missile propulsion and related inspection systems and service life assessment tools that will lead to the transition of the new technologies into propulsion systems for a prompt global strike capability, a land-based strategic deterrent, and an operationally-responsive space lift system.    

 The technology development efforts to be conducted by any contract awarded through this BAA will be conducted under the guidance of the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program and the Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) program. Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that a prospective offeror have either a government coordinated Advance Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP), or develop an ARPP prior to or in conjunction with proposal submittal, or have a documented working relationship with a company possessing a government coordinated ARPP to ensure IHPRPT and TSSS relevance of any proposed technology.  In addition, as part of ensuring IHPRPT and TSSS relevance, the offerors will be expected to define quantitatively the proportion of the overall IHPRPT and TSSS goals each component technology will contribute (i.e. the technology objective), how these individual contributions or objectives “roll-up” to assure the achievement of the overall goal, and identify the means by which achievement of the objectives will be measured. Information regarding the IHPRPT and TSSS programs in general and the ARPP process is available at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards AFB, CA.

Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this market research should contact Ken Thomason at kenneth.thomason@edwards.af.mil.     Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors need apply.  A formal industry day is not scheduled. Interested contractors may request an informal meeting to discuss these requirements. If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your visit request to Joseph Hildreth (661-275-5338) prior to your visit. Discussion topics may include: 1) clarity and content of topic description, 2) clarity and relevance of evaluation criteria, 3) amount and distribution of funding, 4) period of performance5) proposal guidance guidance, and 6) proposal timeline.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Solicitation Number HSCG40-06-Q-40486
          
             Briefly Explain: USCG Yard currently owns a Dynamometer for testing Paxman engines which was manufactured by the Kahn Company. In the past six months or so the Yard has experienced multiple problems as a result of the Dynamometer Power Module failures. The Yard have suggested an upgraded Power Module. The new Power Module will eliminate the reoccurring problems. Since the Dynamometer was manufactured by the Kahn Company they are the only company able to provide the new Power Module due to proprietary drawings, engineering data, patents, and copyrights. Due to the initial investment for the entire Dynamometer it would not be cost effective to replace the entire unit at this time for the failing Power Module. The estimated replacement for the entire unit including installation would be five to six hundred thousand dollars plus up to a year or more of downtime.
