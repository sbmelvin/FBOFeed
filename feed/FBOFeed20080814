<DESC>The Birmingham VA medical Center Research and Development Program administers VA Research Grants which have been approved for the use of animals for research.  All VA animal care and use programs are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC, International).  This station does not have an on-site animal facility for the care and feeding of research animals and must contract this service from another accredited facility in order to support approved and potential research grants.The contractor shall provide feeding / nourishment as many times a day as is the norm for that type of animal.  Contractor shall provide physical housing in a constantly clean environment as would be appropriate to have such research animals in a readily usable condition twenty-four (24) hours a day.This requirement is being solicited on a sole source basis to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Animal Resource Program as they are the only facility feasible to provide this service.  UAB has the only facility that is directly accessible to the VA Research investigator's laboratories.  VHA HANDBOOK 1200.7 states, "Transporting animals into or through areas used by patients or visitors must be avoided whenever possible.  When essential to do so, all reasonable means of minimizing health risk to patients and visitors posed by animal body fluids, waste, and aerosols need to be adopted."  Unnecessary transport over longer distances would cause undue stress to research animals and violate VA Policy in regards to the care of research animals which mandates that the general health of animals is safeguarded and that undue stress is avoided, with appropriate attention paid to environmental factors such as temperature, ventilation, and humidity.

<DESC>The Library of Congress has a requirement for collapsible braille containers. These are
collapsible containers for shipping Braille books and magazines via the United States
Postal Service. The dimensions of the containers are approximately 14 x 12   x  4 3/8.
The container shall consists of an exterior of 18oz. vinyl-coated nylon, an interior of 200
denier oxford nylon, and stiffeners of .060 extruded HDPE sandwiched between the fabrics. These materials are assembled to form a box that opens on two ends, with internal and external flaps to cover the ends.  The external flaps are secured in the closed position by hook-and-loop strips. This product is very complex to manufacture, requiring considerable skill in sewing the parts so that a well formed, rigid box is formed when both ends of the container are closed.

<DESC><p>The Library of Congress is building a state-of-the-art off-site storage facility for collections. The facility will store books, pamphlets and bound periodicals, as well as special format collections, including maps, prints, photographs, music sheets, manuscripts, microfilm and other formats. Collections stored at this facility are housed inside boxes for protection against light, dust and other factors that can damage the items.<br />Many of these collections are in very fragile and brittle condition and require additional protection prior housing inside a box. Some collections are already housed in poor quality/acidic containers, folders, sleeves or boxes. Acidic enclosures must be replaced with acid-free enclosures that meet permanence and durability and help preserve the items. For some of the special format collections, customized acid-free containers are needed to best preserve the collections inside the box according to its shape.
<p>The project will focus on rehousing approximately 200,000 books and pamphlets and approximately 16,000 oversize books from the Collections, Access, Loan and Management Division (CALM), many of which are in fragile and brittle condition.</p>
<p>The contractor personnel will assemble boxes and place each volume in the best fitting box, from among pre-determined sized. Contractor will sort volumes by condition, remove acidic enclosures and metal fasteners, house items inside acid-free envelopes, slings, folders and boxes, prepare envelopes and slings sets, prepare inventory of containers contents, search records in Library of Congress (LC) databases, label containers, duplicate labels on containers, check LC database for bibliographic information of books, input new records into the LC online database, prepare finding-aid lists, cut supplies (such as foam, boards, paper) to fit inside boxes, and prepare additional supplies (such as polyester enclosures with double-sided tape) to house collections. Tasks also include compiling statistical data and providing written weekly reports of activity with photo documentation before, during and after completion of each phase.</p>
<p>It is imperative that this project be conducted by trained professionals with experience in both handling of fragile objects and productivity due to the condition and quantity of these volumes. Work will be carried out on-site at the Library of Congress in Washington DC in a secure location and contractors have to ensure that the necessary quality and quantity of work is performed. The project shall require careful handling, ability to evaluate the condition of individual items, and knowledge of preservation/preventive conservation and archival practices. It also requires knowledge in cataloging of books and periodicals and proficiency in the use of Microsoft Office 2007, especially Word, Excel and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in the RFP.</p>

<DESC><p>The Library of Congress is the national library of the United States. Founded in 1800, it's America's oldest publicly funded cultural institution. In that role and in accordance with it's Congressional mandate, the Library's mission is to make it's resources available and useful to the Congress and the American people and to sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations. The Library of Congress has millions of items in various types of media stored across the globe. Library Services must plan the operations and support services needed to pro-actively manage the enormous physical and digital inventory featuring distributed databases over a petabyte in size. Some will be creating databases that grow by petabytes each year. The Library is also moving toward consolidating access into its systems through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) techniques. The National Audio-Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) has been designed and built to include the above requirements. In order to obtain the greatest value from this design the next step is to architect the rest of Library Services to connect to the NAVCC to create a more integrated system and achieve greater value from the collections and more efficiency throughout the organization.
<p>Library Services (LS) at the Library of Congress is seeking consulting services in order to generate the requirements for the next generation of computer systems and workflow process in 10 divisions under LS and the library-wide born digital workflow. The goal is to seamlessly connect the NAVCC with the Library, thereby creating greater value with the collections and efficiency for the organization. These requirements documents will be generated using IEEE compliant standards for the purpose of being used to generate a request for proposal to build new systems. The departments to be evaluated are: NAVCC connectivity, American Folklife Center, the Veterans History Project, the Baseline Inventory Project, Collections, Access, and Loan &amp; Management Division, Asian Division, Geography and Map Division, Manuscript Division, Music Division, Prints and Photographs Division, Rare Book and Special Collections Division and born digital workflow.</p>
<p>The consultant will analyze the current state of operations of the NAVCC and ten divisions within Library Services and the born digital workflow, conduct operational and technical audits of workflows and procedures for each group, analyze stand alone cataloging databases and systems currently in place, and determine which databases and systems are adequate and which should be augmented or replaced and recommend new technology development and a future direction for Library Services. Vendor analysis will be included in the recommendations. This effort will result in IEEE compliant documentation.</p>
<p>Proposals shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in the solicitation, Request For Proposal LCLSC08R0557.</p>

The Office of Medical Services has two clinical analyzers that have been in use for more than 15 years.  Abbott Laboratories has discontinued making reagents for these analyzers because they are introducing new technology for the following tests:
1)	Special Chemistries: hTSH and PSA2)	Immunology: Hepatitis Profile: Hep Bs Ag, Hep Bs Ab, Hep C and HIV1/2 
MED/LAB has a need to procure or lease an analyzer that would perform specific testing and would replace the existing two outdated analyzers.  The ECiQ analyzer from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (OCD) will alleviate the need to outsource specific Immunology and Special Chemistry tests that have been both time consuming and costly to the office.Upon review of the analyzers currently on the market, the ECIQ is able to provide a profile that fits the current requirements for our clearance examination.  The ECIQ will also process Special Chemistry samples for hTSH and PSA.The ECIQ is a product of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (OCD), which currently provides clinical testing materials to our Chemistry laboratory under a Reagent Rental contract.   OCD would be able to assist with interfacing the ECIQ analyzer because they have experience with interfacing our current Chemistry analyzer, the Vitro 250 with our Electronic Medical Record (e MED).  No other company has demonstrated this ability.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GED) plans to procure on a sole basis with Harvard Medical School of Harvard University; 181 Longwood Ave.; Boston, Massachusetts 02115 for laboratory services to perform average telomere length assay testing for pancreatic cancer cases and controls enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) study.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The purpose of this procurement is to determine telomere length by high through-put Q-PCR in 180 pancreatic cancer cases and 360 controls and an additional 5 to 10% blinded quality control samples (27-54 samples). The contractor shall analyze average telomere length in up to 180 samples in triplicate using a Q-PCR assay (e.g. total 1782 analyses); provide a plan for determining if the replicate values in agreement and for repeat duplicated, as needed (allow 5% sample replenishment).

Telomeres are structures at the end of chromosomes that are critical in maintaining the integrity of the genome by protecting against chromosomal break-fusion cycles in the dividing cells. Recent studies have shown the peripheral blood cell (PBC) DNA telomere length in normal somatic cells of health individuals may be predicative marker for disease, including heart disease, insulin resistance, and cancer. Until recently, telomere length measurement in large epidemiologic studies has been limited because the standard method (Southern Blotting) requires significant quantities of DNA and a substantial time investment. Telomere length measurements by real-time kinetic quantities PCR (Q-PCR) are advantageous because they are high-throughput and use a small amount of DNA, making studies of telomere length as a cancer risk factor possible in large studies.

Harvard Medical School of Harvard University and the lab or Dr. Immaculata DeVivo is the only known laboratory to the NCI that currently has an operating telomere assay that is capable of measuring average telomere length in DNA using limited amounts of DNA and with the high-throughput to analyze the needed number of samples. The other techniques available (Southern blot, FISH) require large amounts of DNA that are not available within these studies and lack high-throughput capabilities rendering these techniques unsuitable for the proposed studies. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.

<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis, the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) test of H. pylori, cag A status, and pepsinogen levels and stomach cancer risk in the Cohort Consortium with Karolinska Institute, Department of Medical Epidemiology; 281, S-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.

 The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 611310 the business size standard is 6.5 M employees.

The period of performance for this procurement is September 15, 2008 through September 14, 2009.

The purpose of the procurement is to perform Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) tests for levels of pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II, and H. pylori whole cell antibodies, and immunoblot assays for cagA status, in serum or plasma of stomach cancer cases and healthy controls in a study nested within participating cohorts in the Cohort Consortium. 

Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-established risk factor for stomach cancer.  The cagA strains of H. pylori are known to be particularly virulent and associated with a greater excess risk of stomach cancer.  Infection with gastric pathogen leads to progressive pathologic changes from atrophy to dysplasia and ultimately cancer.  Levels of pepsinogens in the stomach have are a good indicator in the presence of gastric atrophy and an informative predictor of subsequent gastric cancer development.  Together, markers of H. pylori infection and pepsinogen levels form the foundation of gastric cancer epidemiologic research.  Evaluation of other potential gastric cancer risks and mechanisms of progression must take into consideration of H. pylori infection and gastric atrophy as indicated by pepsinogen levels.

The most common test for H. pylori infection used in epidemiologic studies is the ELISA method measuring antibody titers to whole cell and cagA strains in serum or plasma.  Recently, an immunoblot method has been developed which is more sensitive in detecting cagA strains.  The ELISA assay is also used for measuring levels of pepsinogen I and II in serum or plasma.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks.

1.	Receive 2164 frozen serum/plasma samples shipped from a NCI-designated repository.  Confirm receipt of each sample and report to NCI immediately the condition of samples at arrival.  

2.	Store the samples immediately in -80C freezer until ready for assays.

3.	Measure the levels of pepsinogen I and pensiongen II on all 2164 serum/plasma samples received from NCI, using the ELISA method.  

4.	Measure antibodies to H. pylori whole cell on 1574 of the serum/plasma samples designated by NCI, using the ELISA method.

5.	Measure the status of infection by cagA strains of H. pylori on 968 serum/plasma samples designated by NCI, using the immunoblot method.

6.	Deliver the results to NCI in Excel format via email within two weeks of completion of each assay.

Karolinska Institute is a world class institute in studying gastrointestinal cancers, and Dr.Weimin Ye, who directs the laboratory at Karolinska Institute, is an international expert in stomach cancer research and analysis of H. pylori and pepsinogens.  He uses the most advanced immunoblot method in detecting infection with cagA strains of H. pylori in serum and plasma samples.  This method is not currently used in other research or commercial laboratories for large studies, as is proposed in this contract.

The formation of the NCI-lead Cohort Consortium led DCEG iinvestigators to expand the stomach cancer study to other cohorts in the Consortium.  The large pooled data will allow for more refined and definitive analysis of gastric cancer risks, including the association with H. pylori, cagA, and pepsinogens.  For comparability of results from SWHS with those of the other cohorts, the assays need to be conducted in the same laboratory to remove any laboratory variables that could be impossible to control otherwise.  Dr. Ye has extensive collaboration in China and other Asian countries, and has first hand knowledge about sample conditions and the type of H. pylori infection in Asia, which are different from those of the U.S.  This experience is critical for handling the samples in the proposed contract which includes samples from Asian countries and the U.S. There is no other laboratory known to the NCI that can perform the analysis outlined in the procurement.

<SUBJECT>DNA Methylation and Gastric Cancer Risk
<SOLNBR>NCI-80183-NG
<RESPDATE>082908
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov - Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure services regarding DNA methylation and gastric cancer risk in a Polish and Chinese Population with the Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, University of Milan; Via Festa Del Perdono 7, Milan, Italy 20122.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 611310 and the business size standard is 6.5M employees.

The purpose of this project is to perform DNA methylation analysis on DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes from stomach cancer cases and matched control subjects in the Shanghai Women's Health Study and the Polish stomach cancer study.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates chromosomal stability and gene expression and is linked to both transcriptional silencing and activation.  Abnormal DNA methylation patterns have been observed in many types of human tumors, since cells with abnormal DNA methylation acquire an overall gene expression pattern that favors proliferation and differentiation, leading to neoplastic transformation.  In young, healthy mammals, CpG island cytosine is almost universally unmethylated, and the methylation of cytosines in these regions is known as hypermethylation.  CpG island hypermethylation in the promoter regions of a gene is associated with transcriptional silencing of genes that would normally be expressed, such as tumor suppressor genes. 

A significant association between gastric cancer risk and polymorphisms has been noted in several genes.  Carriers of a variant ALDH2 allele associated with deficiency in elimination of acetaldehyde, an alcohol metabolite, are at an increased risk of gastric cancer if they drink alcohol.  Carriers of the TLR4 polymorphism linked with impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide have significantly more severe gastric atrophy and inflammation, and an increased risk of gastric cancer.  There is evidence that suggests polymorphisms in the mucin genes may be related to gastric cancer risk.  These genes encode the glycosylated glycoproteins that constitute the major components of the mucous protective layer in the stomach. CpG islands are present in a number of genes involved in these pathways, including ALDH2, TLR4, MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6, and are therefore potential targets for methylation leading to epigenetic silencing.  The purpose of the proposed contract is to examine hypermethylation in these genes is related to gastric cancer risk, and to explore whether the associations are modified by environmental factors, such as alcohol drinking and Helicobacter pylori infection.

The contractor shall:

1.	Perform bisulfite treatment of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from 700 subjects in the Polish stomach cancer study and 500 subjects in the Shanghai Womens Health Study.

2.	Perform PCR amplification and pyrosequencing for methylation analysis in the promoter region of the following genes:

-	ALDH2, TLR4, MUC1, MUC5, and MUC6 in 700 samples from the Polish stomach cancer study
-	MUC1, MUC5, and MUC 6 in 500 samples from the Shanghai Womens Health Study

3.	The methylation analysis for the Polish stomach cancer study samples shall be conducted in duplicates.

4.	The methylation analysis for the Shanghai Womens Health Study samples shall be conducted in triplicates.  

5.	Deliver results for the MUC genes within eight months after receipt of the samples and the ALDH2 and TLR4 results within 11 months after receipt of the samples.
 
6.	 Prepare a technical report on the details of the standard operative procedures
       used in bisulfite treatment, PCR amplification, and DNA methylation analysis.  

The Period of Performance shall be twelve months from the date of award.

The University of Milan, Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory is the only institution worldwide to have pyrosequencing equipment for methylation analysis dedicated exclusively to environmental health-related research. The pyrosequencing technology on bisulfite treated DNA has the sensitivity and accuracy to detect very small changes in DNA methylation, such as those that are of interest in epidemiologic studies.  The laboratory implements standardized quality control procedures that take full advantage of the pyrosequencing potential.  In particular, the QC procedures permit accurate determination whether bisulfite treatment, a critical step in DNA methylation analysis, resulted in complete cytosine conversion. The Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory has conducted analysis of DNA methylation in relation to gastric cancer risk in the Polish and the Shanghai studies.  The conduction of the DNA methylation analyses in the same lab will allow NCI to simplify the control of laboratory operations and guarantee standardized quality control procedures. The University of Milan, Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory is the only source known to the NCI that can perform the analysis outlined in the procurement.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The purpose of this
procurement is to quantify genomic 5-methyl-2&rsquo;-deoxycytidine (5meC) content in
DNA samples of (1) 40 blinded duplicate pilot samples, and (2) 500 colorectal
cancer cases, 500 matched controls, and 10% blinded duplicate quality control
samples, using a validated, sensitive, high throughput method.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Recent studies have measured
global DNA methylation levels in genomic DNA using peripheral blood, and
correlated hypomethylation status with increased cancer risk (e.g. colorectal
adenoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer) as well as carcinogen exposure
(e.g. low dose benzene).<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
hypomethylation has been associated with folate deficiency among cancer
patients and healthy controls, consistent with animal studies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Evidence also exists to suggest a relation of
global methylation status with smoking, alcohol, HPV infection, and other
environmental factors. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts a study to
evaluate genomic global DNA hypomethylation in relation to colorectal cancer
risk and its potential interrelationship with folate deficiency and other risk
factors.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is important to confirm or
refute previous case-control findings using prediagnostic samples such as those
collected in the PLCO Trial.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

High Pressure Liquid Chromatography/ Tandem Mass Spectrometry, was developed
and validated at the Johns
 Hopkins University.<span>&nbsp; </span>The approach developed at Johns Hopkins
 University is
cost-effective, because it is high throughput with relatively low labor
requirements (i.e. 30-40 study samples per run in half day work of one FTE).

Selected fellows will present their research to those in attendance, and receive feedback on their research as well as their oral presentation skills. Other fellows will present their research in poster format. This is the major format at most scientific meetings. They will learn to present their research one-on-one to those attendants who visit their poster as well as to the poster judges, normally NHLBI investigators.  Finally, we will have several presentations from invited speakers who are leaders in their field who will provide valuable information as well as the opportunity to network with our fellows.  Other activities at the retreat are designed for increasing networking and team building amongst the NHLBI fellows in attendance.

Raytheon is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the ATFLIR Pod and owns the technical data rights. 
In December 2003 the NAVFLIR was removed from the pod and replaced by a surrogate as a result of deleting the NAVFLIR requirement in the Pod. This change retrofits Pod Electronics Housings (PEHs) and Pod Adapter Units (PAUs), which will result in a uniform configuration.

Raytheon is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the ATFLIR Pod and owns the technical data rights. 
This ECP is to induce lower level design requirements at the optical supplier to eliminate the variability from pod to pod as to what secondary beams are present. This change will reduce the secondary beams to levels that are not a safety concern to the end user. This ECP develops test criteria and limits for evaluating fielded Electrical Optical Sensor Units (EOSUs), establishes marking requirements for screened and new EOSUs subassemblies and optical components, adds performance criteria to the optical components, and repairs EOSUs that do no meet test criteria.

<DESC>This notice is merely a PRE-Solicitation Notice.   (A SOLICITATION for this procurement will be published HEREAFTER, in this same FedBizOpps website.)  This procurement is a competitive 8(a) set-aside, meaning that each offeror must be certified, by the U. S.  Small Business Administration (SBA) as an 8(a) firm.  In addition, each offeror must be eligible to perform work under the size-standard associated with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  The incumbent contractor is MacroSys Research and Technology, whose offices are located  at Suite 312, 888  17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20006.  However, the Statement of Work for this new procurement does differ substantially from the Statements of Work appearing in MacroSys incumbent contract documents, so the incumbent contract documents would not be of any help to offerors competing under this new procurement.  MacroSys is eligible to compete under this new procurement.  The information set forth in this Synopsis is ALL of the information that DOT plans to release concerning this new procurement, until DOT hereafter publishes this procurements Solicitation in FedBizOpps.  Therefore, please HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS until after you have carefully studied the forthcoming Solicitation for this new procurement.  The due date shown above is only an ESTIMATED due date for DOTs receipt of proposals.  The ACTUAL due date for proposals will be specified in the SOLICITATION hereafter published in this FedBizOpps website.

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates an award of one Time-and-Materials Contract from this new  procurement.   It is anticipated that the resulting contract will have one Base Year and four Option Years, but no task orders.    

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that under each contract resulting from this procurement, some or all of the following types of contractor support services MAY be rendered to DOTs Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA):  Database Development, Maintenance, and Support, for DOTs Close Calls railroad incident reporting system;  Geospatial Technology Support and Services, for the databases used for the Close Calls system;  providing support for baseline safety culture surveys, analysis, research, and data processing, using transportation statistics; and further development and operation of the Close Calls reporting system; 

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that the following labor categories (job titles) MAY need to be provided by each 8(a) company that receives a contract from this procurement:  Project Manager;  Senior Rail Safety Evaluator;  Rail Safety Evaluator;  Senior Research Assistant;  Survey Methodologist;  Statistician; Data Analyst; Senior Systems Analyst; Systems Analyst; Senior Research Assistant; Research Assistant II; Senior IT Specialist; GIS Specialist; Technical Writer; and Computer Programmer.

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that an aggregate total of 13,300 staffing hours, per year, MAY need to be proposed by each offeror under this procurement.

It is anticipated that about 85% of the work, in all labor categories and in all years of the project, will be performed in the U. S. Department of Transportations (DOTs) headquarters buildings located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S. E., Washington, D. C. , and that about 15% of the work, in all years and in all labor categories, will be performed in other RITA-authorized office space in the Washington, D. C. metropolitan area.  There is, however, a POSSIBILITY that the contract awardee(s) and DOT MIGHT be able to agree upon a set of tele-work procedures that might be used by some or all of a contract awardees employees. 

The forthcoming Solicitation will probably require that the winning offeror (i.e,  the contractor) obtain DOTs approval of the contractors IT Security Plan for this project, within about 30 days after the awardees contract is issued.

IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR TO CLOSELY AND FREQUENTLY MONITOR THIS FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE FOR ANY AMENDED SYNOPSES THAT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE PUBLISHED REGARDING THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR THE FORTHCOMING SOLICITATION FOR THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION----AS SUCH PUBLICATIONS ALWAYS CONTAIN CRUCIAL INFORMATION.

TELEPHONE, FAX AND E-MAIL PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  INSTEAD, EACH OFFEROR MUST SUBMIT ITS PROPOSAL IN HARD COPY FORM.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through the Program
Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to The Academic Pediatric Association,
6728 Old McLean Village Drive, McLean, VA 22101

The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the APA young investigator award annual program for 2008.  The proposed contractor shall review proposals and select recipients/projects.  Each selected recipient will conduct research, present findings at an annual meeting of the Academic Pediatric Association, and seek publication.  In 2008, the award is being supported by AHRQ and HRSA (through an interagency agreement with AHRQ).  There are two foci for this contract:  1) effectiveness of child clinical preventive services with an insufficient evidence base; and 2) other research designed to improve the safety and quality, efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare in general pediatrics.  AHRQ and HRSA work with APA leadership and program staff to develop the invitation letter to fellowship programs so that it accurately reflects these foci.  In addition, AHRQ and HRSA decides during the review process which applications meet the agencies criteria and can be funded with these funds. 

Contractor Requirements:
AHRQ seeks a contractor to conduct and implement a young investigator research/evaluation program that:

-Is well-versed in the area of child health services research and has established specifically an outstanding research/evaluation program for young pediatric investigators that can enhance research knowledge and growth for potential pediatric researchers.   

-Has expertise and experience to provide significant opportunities to conduct research and evaluation focusing on one of AHRQ's priority populations (children) to achieve AHRQs mission-specific goals of improving the quality and safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.

-Has expertise and experience to provide significant opportunities to conduct research on the effectiveness of child clinical preventive services.

-Has experience in implementing a program that is vital to AHRQ and HRSA because it helps train young investigators to conduct research to improve children's health and healthcare.  AHRQ considers the APA young investigator program an integral part of its multi-faceted research education program.  
 
Scope of Work
-Working with AHRQ and HRSA to provide input on appropriate language, the contractor develops/disseminates a call for proposals for the 2008 Young Investigators Awards Program to over 2000 people within 30 days of contract award. 

-The contractor shall compile and assemble proposals and provide a complete package to AHRQ within 30 days prior to review. 

-The contractor, AHRQ, and HRSA will review/rate/rank proposals and select relevant and rigorous projects responsive to goals of overall improvement and effectiveness of child clinical preventive services, and make awards with AHRQ and HRSA approval and with contract funds within 90 days after contract is awarded.  

-The contractor submits a report summarizing awards made during the period of award, including names, degrees, institutions, titles of projects, and abstracts. 

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Joint Tactical Radio 
System (JTRS) Network Enterprise Domain (NED), intends to release Request 
For Proposals (RFP) number N00039-08-R-0028 for the procurement of 
software in-service support for the JTRS SINCGARS waveform.  This requirement 
will provide technical support, porting support, software maintenance, upgrades,

This procurement, originally synopsized 03 October 2007 on the Federal 
Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website under solicitation number N00039-
08-R-0001, was suspended indefinitely via the synopsis modification dated 05 
May 2008 to enable further assessment of requirements and acquisition 
strategy. The current synopsis reflects these updates. 

The Government anticipates a competitive award of a single Indefinite 
Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Individual delivery/task orders will 
be awarded on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis for technical and porting 
support and on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) basis for maintenance, 
upgrades, and enhancements. The basic contract will establish minimum and 
maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have one (1) one-
year base ordering period and four (4) one-year option ordering periods. This 
is a full and open competition. The final solicitation will be issued without 
further notice in June 2008 and will be available to interested parties, along 
with any amendments issued, solely on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central 
website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). 

A Bidders Mailing List will not be established, and hard copies of documents will 
not be provided. Contract award is estimated for September 2008. This 
procurement will require the large business offerors to submit a Small Business 
Subcontracting Plan demonstrating efforts to provide subcontracting 
opportunities for Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 
Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small 
Business (SDVOSB), and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) 
Small Business and other Small Business concerns. The North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. The projected proposal 
due date/time in this synopsis is an estimate only; the actual proposal due 
date/time will be established in the final RFP. Questions concerning this 
synopsis may be directed to Mr. Tom Vinson at tom.vinson@navy.mil or 
telephone (619) 524-5420.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Dr. Dan Esler of Pacific WildLife Foundation, Delta, British Columbia, for research on the recovery of the harlequin duck and Barrow's goldeneye populations following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.  This task will continue a series begun by Dr. Esler in 1995, and will add one more sampling period, for sampling results from Winter 2009.  The goal is to determine when the harlquin duck population that has been impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 is no longer showing injury.  This project was selected by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, to assist in restoring the harlequin duck population in Prince William Sound, Alaska.  Dr. Esler was contacted by the EVOS Trustee Council, through the USGS, and was requested to submit an amendment to an ongoing project to continue his data series.  Dr. Esler, in concert with two USGS Principal Investigators, responded with EVOS project proposal amendment 070808A, which was approved for funding by the Trustees at a meeting on March 17, 2008. The meeting was advertised and any members of the public who wished to object to this decision were encouraged to testify.  There were none.  Following the Council's decision to fund Dr. Esler's proposal, a Federal Court Order was filed, naming Dr. Esler as the recipient of these funds.  He is the only source known that has the specialized skills and experience required.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Contract Specialist by e-mail (rpaprocki@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCES NOTICE.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Eastern Colorado Health Care System Medical Center (VAECHS), located in Denver, Colorado intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Teague Enterprises, 2829 Cascade Place, Davis, CA, 95618-1621, to acquire the TE-10 Smoking Machine and its accessory components.  As the only research-grade smoking machine of its kind that is designed to accommodate rodent cages for use in a laboratory setting, the TE-10 Smoking Machine is the industry standard and will allow the VA to directly compare results with those of current research in the field.  The TE-10 Smoking Machine is a machine consisting of two chambers, one in which smoke from mechanically "puffed" research grade cigarettes is measured, mixed, and blown out, and one that houses cages full of mice.  Smoke is generated in the first chamber and blown into the second, exposing the mice to cigarette smoke for 6 hours/day, 5 days/wk, for 30 weeks, emulating the effects of smoking in heavy smoking humans.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with FAR 4.11 required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.

<DESC>The U.S Department of Education (ED) intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The proposed contract action is for Reading Is Fundamental (RIF).  RIF, a private, nonprofit organization, manages a network of local literacy projects designed to support and promote reading programs to help prepare young children for reading and to motivate older children to read, through the distribution of inexpensive books. RIF enters into voluntary agreements with local private nonprofit groups and organizations or with public agencies that distribute free books to children.  Since 1976, RIF has distributed over 250 million books through these agreements.  The agreements are awarded at various times during the fiscal year, but they terminate by the expiration date of the contract.

Reading Is Fundamental is located at 1825 Connecticut Avenue, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20009.  RIF will administer the distribution of the inexpensive reading materials through the voluntary cooperation of public agencies such as local education agencies, libraries, or nonprofit organizations or groups to serve populations of children with special needs (low-income children, particularly in high poverty areas; children at risk of school failure; children with disabilities; foster children; homeless children; migrant children; children without access to libraries; institutionalized or incarcerated children; and children whose parents are institutionalized or incarcerated) as stated in the legislation.  The legislative authority for this is the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, (Pub. L. 107-110), Title V, Part D, Subpart 5-Reading Is Fundamental-Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, Section 5451.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<CONTACT>Jill M Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-6394, Fax 301-975-8884, Email jill.johnson@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a sole source contract for software maintenance with SIRSI Corporation, 400 Dynix Dr., Provo, UT 84904-5650, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  The NIST Research Library requires an annual software maintenance contract to support software upgrades and to work with NIST staff to ensure proper operations on a daily basis, and proper back-ups of data.  Since this is a requirement for maintenance of proprietary software, only the creator and distributor, the SIRSI Corporation can support the annual maintenance of their product.  This company ahs the sole ability to maintain, update, and service the system software throughout its lifecycle.  Other integrated library systems vendors perform similar sole source activities for their respective systems only and do not service other vendors systems.  There is no other vendor besides SIRSI that can service this system, which is used continually by NIST staff and researchers to access the bibliographic records of the NIST Research Library.  The NIST Research Library also requires renewal support for a link resolver that is compliant with SIRSI Unicorn, and software maintenance for a SIRSI module that will enable SIRSI to provide extensive user statistics to support Research Library decisions.  SIRSI offers Central Search, Article Linker and Directors Station to meet these needs, and the NIST Research Library has invested a number of years into this software, and needs to maintain annual software maintenance on each of these packages.

The sole source determination is based on the need that the existing software is proprietary and can only be obtained from SIRSI.  The NIST Research Library requires maintenance to support software upgrades and to work with NIST staff to ensure proper operations on a daily basis, and proper back-ups of data.  Also required is a renewal support for a link resolver that is compliant with SIRSI Unicorn, and software maintenance for a SIRSI module that will enable SIRSI to provide extensive user statistics to support Research Library decisions.  The product must include the following features:  1) Must be compatible with SIRSI Unicorn; 2) Have a link resolver that is compliant with SIRSI Unicorn, and software maintenance for a SIRSI module that will enable SIRSI to provide extensive user statistics to support Research Library decisions; 3) Be a customizable interface for images, colors, test treatments, and can be adapted to complement ongoing branding efforts; 4) Have a secure interface that provides registered users with authorized access to content and services (including licensed materials), as well as the ability to personalize services provided through Unicorn; 5) Provide a space suited to highlighting events or milestones that drive library usage, promoting new titles or entire collections, or listing recommended resources and best sellers; 6) Includes a consolidated search query box to allow information seekers to find all accessible resources with one search.  Additionally, to ensure more accurate search results, includes a Did You Mean feature that acts as a spellchecker; 7) Displays citations to magazine and journal articles, reference resources, and other content from commercial databases along with all other available library and Web resources; 8) Loads a record into Unicorn with a single command; 9) Displays results instantly for immediate use; 10) Detects duplicates with staff-selected match points for increased efficiency; 11) Includes Post Holding for informing the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) of NIST holdings; 11) Stores, organizes, and accesses NIST library's or archive's non-book holdings; 12) Accesses and views full digital images from any place by anyone with a browser; 13) Searches media collections using full-text, plain English; and 14) Includes hyperlinks to media within OPAC bibliographic records. 

SIRSI Corporation appears to be uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement.  NIST intends to award a firm-fixed-price purchase order for a period of five years comprised of a base year and four one-year options.  Interested parties may identify their interest; however, they must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing, no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson, Contract Specialist, at jill.johnson@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of small business organizations.  The applicable NAICS code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Sources are sought that possess the capability to serve as an Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) for a project entitled: Global Health Activities in Developing Countries to Combat Non-Communicable Chronic Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Diseases.  This synopsis has been prepared to test the marketplace and determine if it is feasible to conduct this acquisition as a small business set-aside. The work to be performed is a new requirement. The contract is anticipated to be awarded on June 8, 2008 for a period of six years. 

The purpose of this program is to combat non-communicable chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD), in developing countries, by enabling clinical research infrastructure development and research training and by conducting research of new or improved approaches, programs, and measures to prevent or treat chronic CVPD.  Program objectives are to develop research Centers of Excellence (COEs) with faculty and staff capable of conducting independent and/or collaborative research, as well as training future chronic CVPD investigators at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels.  This program is expected to stimulate clinical, epidemiologic, health services and outcomes, health policy, translational, and behavioral research.  The COEs, to be awarded in developing countries, will be awarded under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Each COE will propose their own research study and/or clinical trial based on the technical objectives described above.

The Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) will provide administrative support services for the program such as communications, information collection and tracking, cataloging of program tools, identification and assessment of outcome measures and program statistics, preparation of reports, and logistical meeting support as required by NHLBI in collaboration with the COE investigators/staff, Scientific Advisory Board, Data Safety and Monitoring Boards (DSMB), collaborating universities, global health organizations, non-government organizations, corporations, foundations, and other NIH Institutes and Centers.  The ACC will facilitate the initiation and growth of the program.

The ACC will perform the following program requirements: 1.) Design and maintain a Manual of Operations describing all ACC activities including, but not limited to, timelines, coordination activities, data collection, data assembly, data storage, data security, data analysis, and reporting.  2.)

Provide guidance to the Centers of Excellence pertaining to Human Subject issues (examples include, but are not limited to: protocols, informed consent, data safety and monitoring, and other human subject related issues) and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approvals. 3.) Create a comprehensive electronic database to track the activities and achievements of each Center of Excellence.  The database shall enable disease and program specific queries across Centers of Excellence so that reports of the entire programs progress can be easily generated. 4.) Plan, develop, and maintain a program website.  5.) Provide organizational and logistical support and structure to the programs committees and subcommittees. Promote communication between the Centers of Excellence, NHLBI, Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs), and a Scientific Advisory Board.  Responsibilities shall include developing appropriate websites and calendars, arranging and scheduling meetings, collecting and distributing appropriate materials and reports to committee members on a timely basis prior to each meeting; taking, seeking approval for, editing, and distributing minutes, maintaining a central repository of minutes; and maintaining all other materials relating to committee functioning. 6.) Manage unanticipated problems and study related Adverse Events. 7.) Obtain ACC IRB approval of protocols, consents, and amendments for the COEs. 8.) Design and implement a plan for study close-out, analysis, and dissemination of program information.  9.) Assist in ensuring an orderly and efficient transition to any successor contractor.  10.) Create a public use dataset, and design and implement a plan for data sharing.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought: The Department of Commerce, US Commercial Services (CS), Marketing and Communications Office (MCO) has become a victim of its own success. We've worked hard to promote our office as a field resource and now demand for graphics, writing, and general marketing support is greater than our capacity to fulfill them. We spend too much time on uncoordinated, tactical execution of routine tasks, with little automation or knowledge management. Given this, we are unable to devote sufficient resources to key strategic initiatives and cannot provide optimal customer service to the CS field.
<p>Everyday, the CS Marketing Office receives multiple requests for logo files, new event flyers, reports, and other design work. These requests are time consuming and never ending. Currently, MCO staff spends up to 40 percent of their workday searching for, creating, recreating, editing, reformatting, and disseminating marketing content on behalf of its internal customers. Often, we are viewed by the CS field as a bottleneck; so many CS personnel create their own marketing content rather than collaborate with MCO. The result is that MCO marketing content is underused and misused, meaning brand compliance and consistency suffer.</p>
<p>Given the routine nature of many of these requests/tasks, a great many could and should be automated. MCO needs a digital solution that will free its staff from having to perform time-consuming, routine field/customer fulfillment tasks associated with generating and distributing marketing/brand content. This solution will empower MCO to ensure CS brand consistency, provide better customer service experiences for the CS field, and focus on more value-added activities.</p>
<p>MCO requires a contractor to provide a digital brand management solution that 1) facilitates quick, easy, and secure access to all CS brand assets for over 2,000 authorized end users worldwide, and 2) integrates and automates the workflow associated with the development, customization, approval, and deployment of these brand assets.</p>
<p>All responsible sources , please submit your email address, telephone number, and a short demonstration of your capability if interested in receiving a solicitation for the above requirement. This requirement will go out under FAR Part 12 should a solicitation result from this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>Responses or questions results from this notice may be submitted via email to Annita Wimbish at Annita.L.Wimbish@noaa.gov, no later than August 21, 2008, no later than 12:00 P.M. noon Eastern Standard Time.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed-price purchase order for 28 each marine pop-up satellite tags on a sole source basis from Wildlife Computers, Inc. (WCI), Redmond, WA based the following reasons: 1) WCI and Microwave Telemetry, Inc are the only two sources that can manufacture the product needed; 2) All design documentation is proprietary of WCI or Microwave Telemetry, Inc., and could not be re-engineered in a cost effective manner by another vendor or the Government. 3) Specifications must be met to ensure compatibility of results with earlier results of the same study; 4) WCI and Microwave Telemetry, Inc. are the only suppliers that have pop-up satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle they are put on dies, that scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system; 4) The protocols include a mechanical fail safe system that releases the tag prior to the pop-up date if the turtle sinks past 1,500 m. Also, this tag (MK-10 PAT ) has software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. They also can be programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. They also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using know-fate-mark-recapture analysis methods.
<p>Pop-Up Archival Transmitting Satellite Tags Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Weight 80 grams or less, excluding tether and attachment (to animal) material, and positively buoyant when released from tether.<br />2. Operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000m, temperatures of 0 to +60 degrees Celsius, and placed globally.<br />3. Lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10000 32 byte transmissions; tag with salt water switch and with out-of water sensor.<br />4. 16 Mbytes of non-volatile flash memory; detailed data are stored in archival tag and summary data are transmitted at release.<br />5. 12-bit analog converts to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings.<br />6. 8-bit analog to digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings.<br />7. Depth accuracy of 1% or better, measurable between 0-1000 m with a resolution of 0.5 m.<br />8. Temperature accuracy of 1% better, measurable from 0 to +60 degrees Celsius with resolution of 1.05C.<br />9. On-board real time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings and release date.<br />10. Light level measured as irradiance at a wave length of 550 nm.<br />11. Fully controllable and upgradeable onboard software; all parameters are user-programmable.<br />12. Corrodible link to tether that releases the tag when either the user programmed release date is reached or the premature release criteria is met.<br />13. Premature release features:<br />a) RD-1500 to sever tether at depth of approximately 1500 m.<br />b) User programmable software to release tag from tether (via corrodible link) when tag has been at a nearly constant depth over a period of time (programmable threshold duration) and with a variance set by the user.<br />14. Transmission at pop-up to AGOS satellite with repetition rates of 44-64 (user programmable).<br />15. Seconds of frequency tables of depth distribution and temperature distribution, depth-temperature profiles, light level and locational data, and tag status data for each sampling interval specified by the user.<br />16. Transmission to include check sum error testing.<br />17. Priority transmission of detailed data corresponding to the 15 days prior to release of tag, if premature release criteria met.<br />18. User controllable start up of tag without computer link, once the tag has been programmed by the user.<br />19. User programmable depth to trigger initialization of the software for the pre-release criteria.<br />20.

<DESC>The  Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Office of Audit Services (OAS)  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for one base year, and four option years with Dr. Alan H. Kvanli, 3837 Hunters Trail, Carrollton, TX 75007 to continue assisting the OAS in statistical auditing and methodolgies.

The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41U.S.C.253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
  
Since February 8, 1988, Dr. Kvanli has provided the Office of Audit Services (OAS) with statistical advice and assistance including development of a new multistage methodology based on the work of Rao, Hartley, and Cochran (RHC).  Dr. Kvanli wrote computer programs to select the sample items using the RHC methodology and to appraise the audit data.  This methodology was used in multistage audits, including the CMS financial statement audit, with significant reduction in audit resources.  Dr. Kvanli is thoroughly knowledgeable of all methodologies used by OAS and has unique knowledge of the RHC methodology used by OAS because he is the author of the methodology.  Dr. Kvanli is a recognized author in the area of statistical auditing and the mixed distribution problem involving audit data.

Dr. Kvanli is also the developer of the OAS Windows RAT-STATS 2007 statistical software, which is used by OAS to select statistical samples and calculate statistical estimates of savings and recommended overpayment recoveries.  When modifications are needed, Dr. Kvanli is in the unique position, being the author of the software, to make any necessary changes and enhancements.  

Since 1988, Dr. Kvanli has provided OAS with expert advice, addressing legal challenges to statistical methods, computer software, and statistical estimates.  The legal challenges to an audit can extend over many years.  Dr. Kvanli is presently involved in addressing challenges to some of the OAS audits.  Retaining Dr. Kvanli will assure his uninterrupted support in addressing ongoing challenges.  Only Dr. Kvanli with his specialized expertise can provide this support.

Dr. Kvanli is an author of the training materials for the OAS intermediate and advanced sampling courses that are taught to OAS auditors.  Only Dr. Kvanli has an in-depth understanding of these materials.  Dr. Kvanli has been a very effective instructor for OAS auditors and statistical specialists.

Dr. Kvanli has an active knowledge of OAS sampling policy having helped OAS since 1988 to address statistical policy issues as they arise.  

There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the required statistical advisory and assistance services for OAS.

Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities including detailed documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirements.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following:  (1) Demonstrate specialized experience in audit sampling, in particular multistage sampling designs in auditing and mixed distributions involving audit data. Show experience in developing computer appraisal programs to appraise audit data and in certification of computer programs.  Demonstrate experience in working effectively with auditors. (2) Vendor must have a Ph.D. and strong academic background to be a credible expert witness before the board of appeals and in courts of law in the event statistical projections are challenged.  Vendor must demonstrate proven exeperience in developing computer programs to perform simulation studies for policy evaluation and to appraise audit data.  Vendor must have access to his own microcomputer that runs Microsoft Windows for computer program development and for analysis.  Offeror must be an experienced instructor capable of communicating clearly and effectively to auditors, Statistical Specialists, and OAS statisticians. (3)Vendor must demonstrate understanding (a) of statistical methodologies and generally accepted statistical principles of statistical sampling in accordance with the required work and OAS Audit Policies and Procedures, Chapter 20-02, Sampling and Estimation Techniques in Auditing, (b) and problems and concerns of auditors in their use of sampling. (4)  Proven experience for developing sound sampling methodologies and policy.

Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source award to Dr. Kvnali.  Responses must be submitted by August 28, 2008 to the Contracting Officer's email address  No solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses submitted is solely within the discretion of the Government

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine sources with the capability and availability to meet requirements for a Continuity of Operations (COOP) purposes, such as severe weather, terrorist attack or civil unrest, US Coast Guard Sector (hereinafter SEC) New Orleans Incident Command Post (hereinafter ICP), which is a 24 hour, 7 day a week operational command center, will need to be stood up in a safe location that is away from current and potential future COOP hazards and dangers, especially hurricanes.  The US Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is the procuring office for this action.  This facility will also need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead US Coast Guard during current and post COOP operations.  The US Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the first right to use the facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 3 or greater hurricane to hit the New Orleans area resulting in evacuation of New Orleans, LA.  At least 72 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 3 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit, this will require the USCG to stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  Sector New Orleans will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The ICP location needs to be located in Natchez, Mississippi.  Nextel Reception (which is the Coast Guard cellular phone service)  Area should have both Sprint wireless and Centennial Wireless coverage.  Hospitals must be nearby in addition to other basic amenities (commercial airport, shopping centers, sport facilities) that are able to support SEC New Orleans (a 500-person command) if the Coast Guard cannot return to their office in downtown New Orleans.  Office space/conference rooms will be needed for the ICP to be set up and run by the U.S. Coast Guard Sector New Orleans Hurricane Evacuation Team.  Office space/conference rooms to house a day/night, 24-hour watch.  One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 4,000 square feet and another boardroom style space that must be no smaller than 300 square feet.  The 4,000 square feet office space/conference room must be available for pre-installed communication upgrades that will accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 40 phone/fax lines and 40 internet connections spread out in the room.  We will also need the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows.  The 4,000 square foot office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 2 cable lines.  The facility should be able to provide tables and chairs for at least 150 people.  Parking will be needed for 200 vehicles.  Contract to include trash pick up of conference room and general cleaning of floors and available restrooms.  Meal services to provide three well balanced and nutritious meals per day and a midnight rations (finger food) service.  The convention center to manage all meal-related business such as staff to charge and collect monies for each meal for each member passing through buffet style serving line, accountability of meals served, set up, pick up, sanitation, meal preparation, eating facility, tables, chairs, utensils, napkins, menu preparation, etc, as if running a full time restaurant exclusively for U. S. Coast Guard personnel and related subcontractors or partners as deemed authorized by the USCG.  Approximately 95 hotel rooms will be needed as soon as it is known that normal operations will be impossible in the New Orleans area.  It is requested the United States Coast Guard have the first right to 95 rooms.  Two of the total 95 rooms must be suites for high ranking military personnel.  An airport with a runway at least 6500 X 150 feet must be within 10 miles of the ICP location.  All office space/conference rooms must be within the same facility and hotel accommodations need to be within close proximity (walking distance) (less than  miles).  This requirement is necessary since US Coast Guard military and civilian personnel will be working long shifts throughout the day and night.  It is the Coast Guards intent to issue an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) to obtain services.  Interested sources should provide the following information via to the address below.  Name of Company and Address, Point of Contact and phone number, Business Size (small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business or women-owned small business concerns). The NAICS code is 721110. The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing August 2008.  No other sources sought notice will be provided.  Interested vendors should respond to this notice by Close of Business June 4, 2008.  Competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research.  At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  This notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the Sigma tandem parachute system is United Parachute Technologies (UPT). The Sigma tandem parachute system is the only tandem parachute system that is currently being used by DoD parachute teams (the Golden Knights, the 101st Airborne Parachute Team (Screaming Eagles), and the Ft Benning Parachute Team (Silver Wings)).</p>
<p>The DoD-sanctioned proponent for sport parachute equipment is the US Army Parachute Team (Golden Knights) and they have only approved the Sigma for military parachute teams. Sigma tandem parachute systems are such a specialized piece of parachute equipment that would require months of testing by the DoD at significant expense and lost productivity that it doesn't justify purchasing tandem systems that are not consistent with other DoD parachute teams. The Golden Knights are the only DoD certified tandem instructors on the Sigma tandem system. They will provide instructor training for members of the CPT. Sigma tandem parachute systems are not comparable/interchangeable with other tandem systems due to different designs and safety/emergency procedures. If any other tandem parachute system is purchased, the CPT will not be able to utilize the training that will be provided by the Golden Knights. The approximate cost for that training is estimated at a minimum of $3,000. The CPT changes personnel approximately every 18 to 24 months and training would need to be accomplished for the newly assigned instructors. Due to the Golden Knights being able to train the CPT personnel will also save the government significant future training costs.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Professional Responsiblity, Technical Operations Group has a sole source requirement for a Forensic Recovery of Evidence Data Center (FREDC). A search of the Internet did not produce any open-market providers. No vendors were found on GSA. This is a highly specialized and customized piece of computer equipment made by only one company, Digital Intelligence.

This system is comprised of the FREDC Forensic File Server Module, a Recovery of Evidence Device Module, a retractable keyboard and 19 inch LCD Display Module, a KVA UPS Module, an Ethernet Switch Module and a FREDC RAID Array Module. Also included is an 8TB RAID Array Module, a DLT Robotic Tape Library, Rackmount Network Switch, Rackmount Network Patch Panel, and a KVM over IP Remote Access Module.

This system is currently in use by other Federal agencies and law enforcement entities. It would be highly desirable and cost effective to maintain continuity of equipment within Government agencies. The attached Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition more fully explains the details of this equipment and why it is being considered a sole source procurement. This notice is being posted in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).

<DESC>Notification to USSOCOM Prime Contractors (Other than Small Business Concerns) on the implementation of the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS)

Please be advised that the Department of Defense (DoD) will use the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) for the October 2008 subcontracting reporting period.  Prime contractors (Other than Small Business Concerns), along with their subcontractors, are required to submit subcontract reports using the eSRS for the October 2008 and all subsequent reporting periods. 

Prime contractors are to modify all subcontracts subject to the flow down requirements of FAR 52.212-5, 52.219.9 and 52.219-25. This requires each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan to provide the prime contract number, their own DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the Government Contracting Officer or Contractor Official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the reports, to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans so their subcontractors can file Individual Subcontracting Report (ISR) and Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) reports.

Instructions and tranining on eSRS can be found at http://www.esrs.gov.  Contractors are advised to review the training materials located on this website prior to submitting a report. Training presentations can also be found on the DPAP website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/electronic_subcontracting_reporting_system.html.  

If you have an unclassified contract with USSOCOM that includes a subcontracting plan, you are required to file your reports using eSRS instead of sending in the hard copy Standard Forms 294 or 295.  DoD  and USSOCOM will cease to accept SF 294s and 295s after the end of the FY 08 reporting period.

The contractor for this proposed Sole Source contract is: Buffalo Computer Graphics Inc. Cage Code 0AK34. This is a Sole Source Procurement. 
Below is: Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition, Statement of Work for this requirement.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
 Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: 
1)	Agency	and	Contracting	Activity:  

The US Coast Guard, Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition. 
2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  

The USCG intends to sole-source its requirement to upgrade an existing PCS-100INS Radar Simulator unit with all current version of BCG PCS-100INS software and add to it, the BCG Coast Guard AIS Blue Force Tracking (BFT)/ Sensitive but Unclassified Tactical Information Exchange and Display System (STEDS) simulation package.  This BCG AIS BFT/STEDS software application was developed specifically for the Coast Guard by BCG under contract to C2CEN and is a unique item to the Coast Guard.  C2CEN purchased two of these simulators approximately 12 months ago  the unit being upgraded will be the third such BCG AIS BFT/STEDS simulator owned by C2CEN.  
In addition to upgrading the simulator, this procurement includes three one week periods of on-site engineering support.  BCG will provide engineering support, integration modifications, and interoperability testing on the AIS BFT/STEDS portion of the simulation software package of all three BCG AIS BFT/STEDS simulators owned by C2CEN.  This support will be procured on a weekly basis for on-site work at C2CEN.

3)	Description	of	Supplies	Services  : 

The proposed acquisition consists of the following: 
a.  Buffalo Computer Graphics (BCG) PCS-100INS Simulator for AIS VDL annex 1 & 2 upgrade (AIS BFT/STEDS).  1ea
b.  Three weeks (5 days ea.) onsite BCG Engineering Support to be performed at C2CEN in Portsmouth, VA.  3wk

4)	Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii) entitled Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. 
5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: 

The BCG AIS BFT/STEDS simulator upgrade being purchased was designed and built by BCG specifically for C2CEN in support of the Coast Guards initiative to develop a scaleable Electronic Chart System (ECS) and Electronic Chart System and Integrated Navigation System (ECINS) solution.  The ECS/ECINS development effort, known as Vega, is fundamentally driven by the Coast Guards need for a proprietary ECS and ECINS AIS BFT/STEDS solution.  Following is a summary of CGHQ requirements which make this procurement	necessary:

a.  The Coast Guard AIS VDL Annex 1 Blue Force Tracking (BFT) system will be developed by CG C2CEN and deployed as a built in capability of the L3 Protec-M (version 2) AIS transponder installed on all Coast Guard cutters and boats.  AIS BFT/STEDS annex 1 employs standard AIS message 6 and 8 to transport encrypted STEDS	data. 
 
b.  The Coast Guard AIS VDL Annex 2 Blue Force Tracking (BFT) system will be developed by CG C2CEN and deployed as a built in capability of the L3 Protec-M (version 2) AIS transponder installed on all Coast Guard cutters and boats.  AIS BFT/STEDS annex 2 employs standard AIS message 25 and 26 to transport encrypted STEDS	data.

The Buffalo Computer Graphics (BCG) PCS-100INS Simulator with the AIS BFT/STEDS VDL annex 1 & 2 upgrade installed represents the only means currently available to conduct engineering and acceptance testing on the Vega application and the L3 AIS transponder firmware.  

6)  Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable:  

Market research was conducted 05-07 July 2008 to determine if any other commercial off-the-shelf systems and engineering services could be used to perform the required upgrade and engineering support.  Due to the Coast Guard specific AIS BFT/STEDS VDL Annex 1 & 2 implementation, no other source was identified or could be deemed suitable for use in support of the Vega AIS BFT/STEDS software development and testing effort.

7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

Fairness of price is based on past purchases of similar simulator upgrades and analysis of professional engineering services listed in the GSA 871 PES Schedule.

8)  Description of Market Research: 

Market research was conducted 05-07 July 2008 to determine if other commercial off-the-shelf systems and engineering services could be used to perform the required upgrade and engineering support.  Due to the Coast Guard specific AIS BFT/STEDS VDL Annex 1 & 2 implementation, no other source was identified or could be deemed suitable for use in support of the Vega software development and testing effort.
  
9)	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:
There are no other facts to provide. 
10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition:  
No other interest has been expressed.   
11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: 

As long as no other vendors produce AIS Annex 1 & 2 BFT and STEDS simulation software that meets the specific Coast Guard AIS VDL Annex 1 & 2 BFT and STEDS requirements, Buffalo Computer Graphics will be allowed to provide the required product.  The USCG will watch market developments closely to ensure that any simulator systems developed by other vendors are considered for use in the Vega software development and testing project.  


End of Sole Source Justification.

The Contracting Officer, James A. Lassiter has approved this Justification.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.</p>

<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price and Past Performance. Past performance is apporoximately equal to Price when being evaluated. The Contractor will send Attachment 4, Past and Present Performance Survey to companies for which they've done similar work.

<p>Accordingly, Anixix is the only firm capable of providing the maintenance and support for current computer security without the U.S. Government experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

These procedures include, but are not limited to, ensuring established mandatory notification requirements and time limits have been adhered to; releasing vehicles claimed by the rightful owners or lien holders upon payment of assessed charges and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; and disposing of unclaimed or abandoned vehicles by sale.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term owner shall include the owner of a vehicle, his or her heirs, next of kin, or legal representative.<BR>a.     An owner has 120 days from the date notification of vehicle impoundment (DD Form 2507) was mailed to him or her, as the last known owner, to claim the vehicle.  If the vehicle remains unclaimed after 120 days, but a lien holder is known, the vehicle will be released to the lien holder, subject to the lien holder paying all associated impoundment and handling fees. <BR>b.     If, after 120 days from the date notification of vehicle impoundment (DD Form 2507) was mailed to the last known owner, the vehicle is unclaimed and no lien holder is known, the Fort Carson Installation Commander, or his designated representative, shall appoint a board, comprised of one or more commissioned or non-commissioned officers, to conduct an inquiry and establish findings as per DoD 4160.21-M, Chapter 4, paragraph B.40.<BR>c.

If, after 45 days, the owner does not claim the vehicle, the vehicle may be sold.<BR>d.     If the owner gives up his or her rights to the vehicle at any time in the process, by signing the appropriate section of DD Form 2507 and returning it, and no lien holder exists, following Board concurrence, the vehicle may be disposed of by sale.<BR>11.2.  If an impounded vehicle is determined to be stolen; the Provost Marshal shall notify the Colorado Crime Information Center and the owner of the location of such motor vehicle within 72 hours after receiving notice that such vehicle is a stolen vehicle.  The Vendor will release the vehicle to the owner without delay and unless directed otherwise by competent authority.<BR>11.3  Abandoned vehicles that have been towed by the Vendor which are found later to have evidentiary value will be transferred to proper contractual coverage, outside this Agreement, through notification to the Vendor by the PMO or the Contracting Officer.<BR>12. FEE AND CHARGES:<BR>12.1   The proceeds from the sale of an abandoned vehicle found on Fort Carson first shall be used to cover the costs of collecting, storing, transporting, and selling said abandoned vehicle.  The total costs incurred for said collection, storage, handling, and sale shall not exceed 20 percent of the gross sales price.<BR>12.2 The Vendor shall be permitted to charge for the winching and waiting services when winching is necessary as a result of the location of the vehicle, or when the Vendor has been summoned to perform services and is unable to do so immediately due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the need to await completion of rescue squad operations.  Time shall begin when the Vendor arrives at the scene of an accident and concludes either when the winching operation is complete or when the Vendor is able to begin other named services.  Time shall be rounded to the nearest one-half hour.  At no time will Vendor be allowed to begin time if an error has occurred on its part; i.e., must depart and return due to wrong equipment, vehicle or personnel.<BR>12.3 The Vendor shall be permitted to charge an administrative fee per action to include a possible abandonment processing fee and postage certified notification letters to the lien holder or owner and the DMV of the appropriate state.<BR>12.4	The Vendor shall determine his/her fees for each vehicle based on the Fees/Charges Schedule. <BR>12.5  The Vendor will estimate a realistic price for sales of vehicles using dealers Blue Book values as a guideline.<BR>13.  Upon the final sale or other disposition of a vehicle, the funds collected that exceed the permissible towing and impoundment charges assessed against the vehicle shall be forwarded by the Vendor in accordance with paragraph 6.3, above.  Associated records shall be provided to permit individual identification of the original owner/lien holder,  if known, on all sales.  By signing this Agreement, the Vendor acknowledges its understanding and agreement that monies generated from disposal of unclaimed vehicles may, on occasion, be insufficient to cover all fees.<BR>14.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  Documents applicable to this Agreement are identified below.  The Vendor shall adhere to those documents unless otherwise specified in this Agreement.  Supplements and/or amendments to the publications may be issued during the life of the agreement and shall be considered to be in full force and effect as of the effective date of the supplement and/or amendment unless it requires additional performance effort by the Vendor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is set-aside 100% for small business. We have a requirement to provide a Case Management and Tracking System to report and track Department of Defense (DoD) Labor and Employee Relations (LER) Cases at both Departmental and Component levels for the Civilian Personnel Management Services (CPMS).  A copy of the full Statement of Work, Evaluation Criteria, and Product Requirements Document can be obtained at our web page http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm. The potential contractor shall be required to provide an enterprise-wide, web-based tracking application that will provide an effective mechanism for all Components and Defense Agencies to manage and track all types of cases, a comprehensive repository for case information, on-line filing, electronic file management, and a full-featured report generation module to meet a variety of reporting requirements and program evaluation needs.  The contractor shall provide commercial off-the-shelf software which provides an automated, web-based case management and tracking system and relational database to include a reports module.  Any potential contractor, in consultation and approval of CPMS, shall purchase, configure, and deliver the necessary hardware for 24/7 access and operation of the System.  The contractor needs to provide a user guide in the form of a web linked document and/or appropriate Help screens embedded in the systems functionality.  The contractor shall provide a train-the-trainer (T3) session(s) to facilitate user understanding and maximize use of the System.  The contractor, in consultation with CPMS, will develop materials necessary to market the availability and capability of the System to all user groups, leadership, and employees.  Once this portion of the requirement is completed, consulting services and support will be required.  The full range of consulting services required from the contractor has not been determined; however, CPMS anticipates that such services may include, but not limited to, the following:  The contractor shall meet with the CPMS-identified user group to determine if and to what extent changes/configuration to the software system may be required to accommodate multiple DoD business rules and processes.  At this point, CPMS plans to use the existing help desk support for the System, but the contractor shall be required to provide at least an 8-hour per day, 5 day per week (Monday  Friday) window for receipt of technical support for DoD systems administrators.  The contractor will also be expected to perform all systems maintenance and installation, testing and deployment of software upgrades. Except for initial hardware configuration, which may take place at a location of the contractors choosing, all other work under this delivery order as described above, will be performed at DoD CPMS Headquarters, Rosslyn, Virginia.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and awarded as a firm-fixed price with base year plus 4 option years. Provide a cost for the base year and each option year. Award shall be made using the Best Value approach with the evaluation criteria in Section C of the statement of work attachment. The result of the award will be posted in FedBizOpps under Award Notices. Questions pertaining to the Award Notice must be submitted in writing. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the potential acquisition is 541511, with size standard of $25 million.  All offerors who provide goods or services to the DOD must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov ), as well as, the Wide Area Work Flow system (WAWF) (https://wawf.eb.mil ) in order to receive the award if you are selected. If you are not in the CCR at the time we are ready to make the award, you will be disqualified. The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.

Within an established framework that provides high-level prevention, care and treatment activities, incumbent must interact with a widely diverse staff in a large, well-developed office environment. Incumbent is expected to develop creative solutions to problems that arise and must be able to recognize when a given framework is inadequate. In-depth analysis and determination of best options is a significant feature of the work. Ability to develop innovative interventions and work creatively is an important aspect of this position.</p>
<p>Problems encountered by incumbent may vary significantly among a range of projects, and considerable judgment and analysis is required to reach appropriate resolutions. Incumbent must, for example, assist the MOH and partners who encounter difficulties implementing administrative procedures required by PEPFAR. Must have excellent "people skills" and the ability to convince others of a particular course of action. Most common problems encountered: late submissions of requests for supplies or services by technical staff, thereby creating a crisis within the admin office; when office electricity goes off; or when an office vehicle has been involved in an accident. Must be able to understand a variety of complicated factors in a large problem situation and to weigh all related issues. Most difficult problems encountered: When U.S. Embassy and CDC policy conflict and a clear way forward is not apparent; when there is need to respond quickly to changing situations and urgent situations, as when, for example, the office floods over the weekend .</p>
<p>Overall work, in terms of budget and major objectives to be accomplished, is planned one year in advance. Training for office staff is planned quarterly. Day-to-day work is planned one week in advance, but the professional and technical nature of this position requires the ability to adjust priorities frequently, so as to enable response to unanticipated requests requiring short turnaround. The planning of activities will be constantly adjusted based on feedback from the PEPFAR partners.<br />Office facilities management is long-term and may require a period of months to years to identify, assess potential, and gain approval at local, headquarters and central (Washington) levels, from the aspect of cost, availability, security and location.</p>
<p>Incumbent is expected to proactively seek opportunities for program improvements that may include the development and implementation of new or revised strategies and interventions. Incumbent is expected to keep abreast of new developments and innovations in the field and is expected to contribute new ideas and adapt techniques and procedures, as required by CDC and PEPFAR. <br />To manage the office effectively, incumbent must be able to improve procedures, find better contractors and more cost-effective vendors. Incumbent must seek new ways to make operations more efficient and cost-effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Communications:</p>
<p>Internally, incumbent has daily working-level contacts with almost all CDC program staff. Also has routine daily contact with each of the U.S. Embassy offices and often with multiple persons within an office. Communications are on a professional, business level and may be intended for the purpose of gathering information, clarifying issues, negotiating a position to be taken by CDC, or gaining agreement for a procedural change. Internally discusses proposals and issues with CDC staff and comes to agreement on approach to be taken. Serves as liaison with Embassy staff to coordinate and arrange details, as needed. The clarity of the specifics and the preciseness of expression are highly important to the position's successful performance and often, complex information must be conveyed in a convincing and meaningful fashion to individuals such as Country Directors of USG agencies, as well as senior staff at the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>Externally, as a point of contact for administrative operations, incumbent maintains regular, ongoing contact with all external partners and serves as the CDC technical liaison on relevant panels and committees. This contact includes communication with high- and mid-level representatives of the MOH and other partner organizations. These contacts involve sharing information on guidelines for administrative operations. Incumbent has daily contact with a vide variety of Mozambican vendors and contractors. The success of these collaborative activities is highly dependent on the ability of incumbent to develop effective working relationships so as to positively impact CDC- and USG-funded cooperative agreement activities.</p>
<p>Incumbent is required to demonstrate well developed oral communication skills on a regular and ongoing basis, in both English and Portuguese. Successful performance of the position's duties requires highly developed skills for the transfer of routine information, explaining the concepts and importance of administrative procedures. Incumbent must be able to communicate technical information to senior staff on the USG team as well as with partner organizations. Complex explanations must be presented clearly and concisely, and incumbent must be able to restate the same information from different perspectives. Incumbent often is requested to provide complex and detailed explanations, to assure complete understanding among various audiences. This ability is essential for partners who may not grasp the initial explanation of a new and complex set of guidelines or procedures. Incumbent must exhibit tact and diplomacy in discussing the results of sensitive personnel matters, and in dealing with different individuals and levels of understanding, about the meaning of results obtained. Incumbent often is faced with providing detailed explanations about operational program management information to assure complete understanding, or in some cases to take specific decisions or courses of action, without having the authority to compel them to do so.</p>
<p>The job holder is expected to write documents and reports of proposals, situations or events, describing important details with pertinent insight. These either may be original documents on complex subjects that require original thought, or accounts of events that have already transpired. Some reports may be needed regularly or on a periodic basis. Memos must be generated regularly to request services and supplies and must clearly describe in great detail the product and the need. Written justification is an important part of the procedure and must be factual and convincing. Incumbent also may develop written procedures, manuals, or guidelines that will be used by office staff. Some documents, such as cables, receive widespread distribution to other posts, CDC Atlanta and the U.S. State Department in Washington; thus, these must be written at a high level. These written communications may be in English or Portuguese for use by CDC/GAP staff as well as implementing partners, and may contain technical, conceptual and complex details.</p>
<p><br />Working Environment:</p>
<p>Position is in the CDC office, Maputo, with regular visits to MOH, U.S. Embassy and to offices of contractors and vendors.</p>
<p>Job is primarily sedentary, but may be somewhat stressful in terms of long hours, meetings in the evenings or weekend work requirements and short deadlines.<br />Unusual work pattern demands - Long hours, multiple tasks, and weekends on call.</p>
<p><br />Other:</p>
<p>The incumbent in this position must have a very high energy level and the personality to be able to adjust quickly to a number of changing situations.</p>

<p><br />Intellectual Skills:</p>
<p>As an expert in HIV/AIDS research and evaluation, incumbent is required to operate in a highly complex informational environment. Incumbent is expected to have a mastery and specialty expertise in public health research, specifically in design, implementation, and measurement of program evaluations and other operational research projects. Incumbent must use information to develop, disseminate and evaluate highly complex evaluation and other national and international research based on applicable policies, regulations and precedents to assure that research programs are accurate and cost beneficial. These policies, procedures, precedents, etc., come in the form of manuals, technical guidance and informal and formal training. Incumbent also must use information to identify and propose solutions which are characterized by their breadth, importance, and severity; and/or implement complex program policies and strategies to meet new conditions and improve or overcome deficiencies. Incumbent must be sensitive to local and national social and political issues that might affect the successful implementation of evaluations and other research programs.</p>
<p>The work is highly complex, and involves the ongoing analysis of many different and unrelated processes and methods, often requiring the consideration of specific complications, physical settings and other limitations particular to the country, agency or program, to achieve the desired result. Conclusions and determinations made by the incumbent often result in official positions being taken and/or the obligation of substantial program resources, and may be scrutinized by various governmental agencies, partners, stakeholders and the general public. The work involves analysis of highly complex ethical and scientific issues; negotiation between CDC-Kenya and the various national and international agencies, programs and/or partners, and the highest levels of the Kenyan government, regarding needs and resources; coordination with the Associate Director for Science (CDC-Atlanta).</p>
<p>Problems encountered are complex and vary considerably. Iincumbent solves complex problems on a daily basis related to scientific research which frequently requires incumbent to exercise exceptional judgment when dealing with PEPFAR implementing partners, including Ministry officials and leaders of other international organizations and donors, to project a professional and collaborative atmosphere.<br />Examples of most common problems encountered include: Human Subjects Research decisions within various GAP-Kenya research projects, including analysis of critical ethical issues; e.g., if evaluations are determined as research in Kenya and as non-research at CDC/Atlanta, or vice-versa; and strengthening performance evaluations with differences in resources, capacity, awareness and priority setting across agencies and the government.</p>
<p>Examples of most difficult problems include: Challenges related to performing the first AIDS Indicator Survey in Kenya including logistics, identifying and eliminating barriers; and issues related to scientific research vis-&agrave;-vis cultural standards and taboos, e.g., cultural issues related to male circumcision and their impact on HIV prevention.</p>
<p>Strategic planning for setting overall direction and goals for national program management is conducted annually with a vision for 3-5 years in the future. Overall work in terms of major research and evaluation projects to be accomplished is planned one year in advance. Day-to-day work is planned one week in advance, but the technical nature of this position requires the ability to adjust priorities frequently to enable response to unanticipated requests requiring short turn-around.</p>
<p>Because of the complex nature of the duties, incumbent is required to be highly innovative in designing plans and operational guidelines for developing and carrying out effective program evaluations and other operational research studies. Incumbent must be creative and innovative, for example, designing new and more effective approaches to scientific research and capacity building to achieve the goals of GAP-Kenya, and creating and improving a scientific work environment.</p>
<p><br />Communications:</p>
<p>Incumbent communicates with a wide variety of people at many different levels (professional and political), both inside and outside of PEPFAR and CDC (e.g., MOH, international organizations, universities). Incumbent must provide consistent and credible representation of PEPFAR to USG colleagues, donors, and other partners and coordination bodies for program evaluation, survey development, human subjects, and other operational research issues. Frequent contacts will occur with both mid level and high ranking government officials and other partners to define and/or reorient research and evaluation strategies and translate results of these evaluations into program action.

External contacts are also with managers of HIV related programs, scientists, researchers, strategic information managers of other agencies, deliverers of HIV-related services, and conference attendees, to provide day-to-day technical advice and consultation needed to assure that peer evaluations are conducted optimally, to teach scientific writing, and to assure smooth processing of requests for human subject's clearance.</p>
<p>An expert level of verbal communication in English utilizing incumbent's research and evaluation knowledge and skills and displaying a positive attitude and approach is required. Oral communication may be provided one-on-one, in groups, or by telephone with different levels of personnel and groups. Incumbent must have advanced presentation skills for local, national and international meetings to deliver results of research and evaluations to policy makers and service delivery professionals. Incumbent frequently must explain the goals and results of these studies in an appropriate manner to staff and other interested parties of varying degrees of technical expertise, while maintaining sensitivity for the subject matter. This requires tact and diplomacy and persuasive skills to convince key decision makers to strengthen peer evaluation activities.</p>
<p>Routine transmission of information: with colleagues, partners and contract staff to collect and verify information pertaining to the delivery of effective program evaluation research or the process for assuring rapid approval of human subject's requests.</p>

<p>Complex explanations: to communicate complex procedures in the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of research and evaluation activities.</p>
<p>Formal training/teaching: acts as a trainer and/or faciliator in training courses on protocol development, scientific methods and writing, ethical principles of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment activities, institutional review board procedures, and CDC science and ethics procedures and regulations.</p>
<p>Influencing/persuading: when working with senior level decision makers from implementing partners to develop an understanding of the key research issues and the implications of the research results for application to program interventions.</p>
<p>Complex written reports authored and/or reviewed by the incumbent are used as the basis for key management decisions and long-range planning of GAP-Kenya activities.<br />Incumbent also writes and/or reviews scientific manuscripts, scientific presentations, and manages the scientific reference database for CDC-Kenya and GAP-Kenya, which require the highest levels of scientific expertise and experience.</p>
<p>Working Environment:</p>

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541199, identified as FDA-SOL-08-00614, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

 (a)  Background:
For a variety of historical reasons, some drugs are available in the United States that lack required FDA approval for marketing.  FDA has an interest in taking steps to either encourage the manufacturers of these products to obtain the required evidence and comply with the approval provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), or remove the products from the market.  

In June 2006, FDA stepped-up its efforts against marketed unapproved drugs by issuing a final guidance document outlining its enforcement policies aimed at efficiently and rationally bringing all such drugs into the approval process, without imposing undue burdens on consumers or unnecessarily disrupting the market.  With the Compliance Policy Guide (CPG), the Agency announced a renewed focus on the problem of illegally marketed unapproved drugs and that it is committed to solving it.  The Agency also provided the industry with specific notice that anyone who markets an unapproved drug is subject to enforcement action.  Consistent with the Agencys risk-based approach, the CPG gives highest priority to unapproved drugs that have safety concerns, lack evidence of effectiveness, or are health frauds.  

FDA estimates that, in the United States today, perhaps as many as several thousand drug products are marketed illegally without required FDA approval.  Because we do not have complete data on illegally marketed products, and because the universe of such products is constantly changing as products enter and leave the market, we first have to identify illegally marketed products before we can contemplate enforcement action.  Once an illegally marketed product is identified, taking enforcement action against the product would typically involve one or more of the following:  requesting voluntary compliance; providing notice of action in a Federal Register notice; issuing an untitled letter; issuing a Warning Letter; or initiating a seizure, injunction, or other proceeding.  Each of these actions is time-consuming and resource intensive.  
Included in the mix of products marketed without approval are those products considered as part of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI).  With the expansion of FDAs authority under the 1962 amendments to the Act, FDA initiated the DESI project to evaluate the effectiveness of those drugs that had been previously approved on safety grounds alone.  FDA contracted with the National Academy of Science/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) to make an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of over 3,400 products that were approved only for safety between 1938 and 1962.  Drugs that were part of the DESI project, and those identical, related, and similar to them, may continue to be marketed until the administrative proceedings evaluating their effectiveness have been concluded, at which point continued marketing is only permitted if a New Drugs Application (NDA) is approved for such drugs. The vast majority of the DESI proceedings have been concluded, but a few are still pending.  The pending nature of these proceedings allows manufacturers to continue to market often ineffective drug products.  Legal review of the administrative records is required for the remaining pending DESI proceedings to identify and evaluate the regulatory status of these products, and draft Federal Register notices to appropriately close-out these remaining DESI proceedings.
 (b)  Objectives: 
Procure the services of a person with a law degree that has proven experience, expertise, knowledge, and abilities in the following areas:

(1)  The Act and other statutes affecting drug products, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, and the policies, procedures, and guidelines applicable in determining the regulatory status of marketed products as drugs and new drugs. 

(2)  Requirements for legally marketing drug products in the United States, including over-the-counter and prescription drug products.

(5)   FDA policies, laws, administrative issues, enforcement procedures, and regulations for drug products pertaining to the universe of unapproved drug products and DESI drug products.
	
(6)  DESI/LTE or DESI/IRS drug products with ability to provide legal based rationale as to why a drug was evaluated as Less Than Effective (LTE) or why a drug product is Identical, Related and Similar (IRS) to a DESI/LTE drug product.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for supplies in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Mission Support Division located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire the following supplies for five NOAA ships: 1. Quantity of 5 each Gimble Mounting Box P/N70026 and 2.  Quantity of 5 Pkg SAL R1a Speed Log- Single Bottom with Sea Valve. Package Must include: qty of 1 each 703800 ELC Electronics Unit, qty 1 each 705050 TRU Transducer with 30m Cable, qty 1 each 71-21540-00 MSSBSV Bottom part Set Steel Hull Mounting Set for single Bottom with Sea Valve, qty 1 each 704043 SDA Speed/Distance Display and qty 3 each 703810 Manual. Consilium systems are currently the fleet standard for the NOAA west coast fleet. They are the only systems that provide proper and working input to the ships electronic charting systems. The salient characteristics of this system is the correlation principle on which the Consilium speed log system works  sends simultaneously two short parallel sound pulses into the water from two fore and aft oriented crystals.  The direction of the pulses is perpendicular to the ships hull.  Each short pulse creates a reflected sound energy, which is unique for each reflected volume of water.  This creates two similar curve-patterns from the two crystals, but separated in time.  The correlation technique uses the time difference between the two curve-patterns to determine the ship's speed. All interested concerns must submit a quotation within fifteen (15) days of the publication date of this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. A firm-fixed order will be issued with required delivery date of no later than Dec 01, 2008.  Only firms that can provide the exact equipment described herein will be considered. All responses must be in writing and delivery to fax number (206)527-7513 attention to Maria Mendoza or by email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov on indicated response date in the RFQ.

STATEMENT OF WORKThis project proposal is intended to produce a Cultural base map of the 4th Fort complex, and have a Petroglyph Panel documented by 3D Laser Scanning means at Walnut Canyon National Monument. This project will require the contractor to work with Northern Arizona University (NAU) because they will be providing the cultural information for inclusion onto the Cultural Base Map. To get to these ends, the tasks required to produce the products for the Flagstaff Area National Monuments are outlined as follows:
Geodetic Surveying, Photogrammetric Mapping, GIS, Cartography, and 3D Laser Scanning of Petroglyph Panel - TASKS: 1) Walnut Canyon - 4th Fort Geodetic Surveying, Photogrammetric Mapping, GIS, and Cartography A) Research and reconnaissance of existing ADOT, USGS, and USC&GS survey control within or near the project area. Area map to be tied (horizontally) to UTM Coordinate System (NAD83 CORS96 EPOCH 2002.000) and elevations to mean sea level elevation (NAVD88, GEOID03). B) Reconnaissance, siting, and survey of secondary survey control to facilitate the establishment of photogrammetric targeting and mapping control. C) Establishing and surveying photogrammetric control points for registration of aerial photography. D) Aerial Photography: An area of approximately 1000 meters by 750 meters will have stereo aerial photographs taken for the purpose of photogrammetric topography and culture mapping. This area will include the 4th Fort area within Walnut Canyon National Monument. Stereo aerial photography will be taken at a scale of 1:2000 for topographic and culture mapping. Aerial photography will be in color. E) Topographic Mapping: Contour interval will be 20 centimeters. All topographic mapping will be produced photogrammetrically. The mapping scale will be 1:200. F) Modern Culture Mapping: This will be accomplished by photogrammetry only, so that only features visible from the aerial photography will be mapped; walkways, fences, roads, parking lots, structures, larger permanent signs, drainage features, and other facilities - within the limits of topographic mapping. 2) Walnut Canyon - 3rd Fort 3D Laser Scanning of Petroglyph Panel Project A) Reconnaissance, siting, and survey of secondary survey control to facilitate the scanning project and mapping control. B) 3D laser scanning of petroglyph panel using triangulation type laser scanner to acquire 0.2mm accuracy and resolution scan data for documentation of petroglyph panel found at the bottom of Walnut Canyon below Island Trail. Site WACA 209 (Petroglyph Panel) will have a baseline consisting of two datums which may be a combination of 1.2 cm rebar or large nails driven to resistance or PK nails set in bedrock. As noted above, each datum point will have UTM (NAD83/NAVD88) positions established by high-accuracy RTK GPS or total station. These stations will be used to facilitate the scanning and detailed mapping of site-related features and act as reference points for any future investigations or monitoring at these sites. Site 209 will be scanned using a triangulation type 3D laser scanner to collect ultra high-resolution scan data for creation of detailed documentation products. This project will include: 1) all 3D laser scan data collection; 2) surveying all scan targets in the UTM coordinate system to allow geo-referencing of point clouds; 3) point cloud georeferencing, registration, and cleaning, 4) petrglyph panel sheet showing results of scanning data (identify specific element(s) graphically) Computer Cartography 1) Production of WACA Site 209 graphic showing results of 3D laser scan.

Mapping Establishing and surveying datums at sites mapped by NAU in the 4th Fort Area. Site datums and other points of registration for these sites will be established and surveyed, or surveyed where already established (NAD83/NAVD88). The field maps (and digitized data) produced by NAU for each of the sites identified below will be geo-referenced. These sites are: 4th Fort Ciff Dwelling Sites 1) WACA 102) WACA 113) WACA 2104) WACA 2115) WACA 2126) WACA 2137) WACA 2148) WACA 2159) WACA 21610) WACA 217Computer Cartography 1) Production of the 4th Fort planimetric map integrating photogrammetrically-derived topography and modern culture tied to UTM Coordinate System. One (1) map. 2) Production of aerial photographs (contact prints only) for archival use. Note that photo-enlargements are an extra charge. 3) All digitized NAU field maps from 4th Fort area (identified above) will be integrated into photogrammetric map produced for the area. 4) Production of a set of site maps of the digitized Island Trail and 4th Fort field maps, each showing one of the identified sites in detail. Each map would include (where appropriate) topography generated from the photogrammetric topographic mapping effort integrated with the field map data (if possible). Each map would show datums, and all mapped architecture and architectural elements as mapped by NAU staff. 5) Digital files (AutoCAD 2006 or ArcGIS format) of the 4th Fort photogrammetric map and site maps and Island Trail site maps. Each entity will be located on a layer which is named by the type of entity (ie. drains will be on layer "drain", drainages on layer "drainage", wall tops on layer "wall_top", etc.) If there are specific NPS requirements for naming layers, these will be made available to Western Mapping Company prior to reduction of the field data so that these can be incorporated into the digital files during production. Contractor shall provide the following deliverables no later than 30 March 2009:1) Walnut Canyon - 4th Fort Geodetic Surveying, Photogrammetric Mapping, GIS, and Cartography Deliverables will be: 1) Three sets of color stereo aerial photographs (contact prints). 2) Datums established for each site (listed above) in the 4th Fort area (where appropriate and not already established). 3) Digital color ortho-photograph of photogrammetrically mapped area of 4th Fort. 4) 2 color copies and 2 B/W copies of the 4th Fort photogrammetric map (oversize). This map will include topographic and modern culture information derived from the photogrammetric mapping.

Purpose: The planning Charrette is an intensive 1-5 day effort to develop        project requiremts and documentation in support of the Military Construction programming process which identify and resolve issues of standardization, functionality, location, scope, and cost which might otherwise affect execution of the project.

The A-E will develop conceptual floor plans and functional layouts. Special kuse areas within the primary facility must be identidied and accounted for within the cost estimate.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Company, Andover, MA, to establish a new cost plus fixed fee contract vehicle (W9113M-08-C-0207) to meet requirements of the Government. The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. This action is to provide maintenance kits (Crash Kits) used in maintenance support for systems managed by the Night Vision Program Office. Award to any source other than Raytheon would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost. The Government does not possess the technical data packages at this time and therefore has to procure through the original manufacture. This action will establish a new cost plus fixed fee contract. The contract planned period of performance is from date of award through end of 4th quarter 2008. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 this action is directed towards Raytheon Company. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. All responses should be directed to Elbert Clarke, at elbert.clarke@smdc.army.mil, and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services the government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is to negotiate a sole source contract, and is no a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is being issued for information purposes only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. See numbered note # 22.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 04 September 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 25 August 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tammy Bunting at 252-335-6790. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6  STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Cryostat for Measurement of SET Devices to be used in Atomic Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. ***

BACKGROUND
NIST has an ongoing program to investigate single-electron tunneling (SET) nano-electronic devices, for applications in metrology and quantum information.  Amongst the requirements for high-quality measurements of these following devices are the following:

1) Low temperatures.
2) Low noise environment, both electrical and acoustic.

At present, this program has a dilution refrigerator which can achieve temperatures as low as 0.02 K; this system has been shown over the course of years to allow high-quality measurements, with very low electrical noise.  This capability has been achieved by addition of several different types of custom-made filters, which were added to the cryogenic system after its delivery by the commercial vendor.

This dilution refrigerator can achieve very low temperatures, but it is not well-suited to measurements above 0.5 K, nor is it well-suited to varying the temperature.  In addition, it is a slow system: the turnaround time from base temperature to changing samples to return to base temperature is 2 1/2 days.  In order to expand NISTs measurement capability, a temperature scanning measurement system is required.  This will allow measurement over a wide range of temperatures and will allow characterization of a large number of samples by virtue of a much faster turnaround time.

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s): 

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Each, Cryostat for Measurement of SET Devices

Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum required technical specifications:  

Ability to scan temperatures from 5 K to 300 K

The need for filtering and thermalization imposes a requirement that, at every stage including the vacuum flange, there be a large diameter area available for custom-made filters.  This area shall be at least 50 square cm.

Turnaround time: six hours or less.

Low acoustic vibrations transmitted to the sample: the vendor shall specify in the quotation the spectrum of vibrations at the sample space from 0 Hz up to 10 kHz.

Magnetic field: Magnetic field of at least 2 Tesla.

Manual controls: To the extent that this system is designed to be operated in conjunction with a computer, there shall be a parallel set of manual controls that allow full operation of the system without any computer whatsoever.

Unattended time: It shall be possible for the system to run for 30 hours without operator intervention.

A full set of mechanical drawings and manuals shall be included.

To the extent that any metric fittings are used in the assembly, the Contractor shall supply a set of spare metric bolts, nuts, and washers.
The spare bolts shall be identical in size and shape to those used in the system.  The Contractor shall supply at least 50 of each of the spare bolts, nuts, and washers.


***The Contractor shall state the warranty period and the coverage provided.

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination and completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. ***

*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1. Visual and Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2. Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications. The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor. At a minimum, NIST will test to ensure the maximum specified speed and accuracy requirements are met and the required manipulator and rail motions are reached while carrying the rated maximum load and at the manipulator's greatest rated extension.

****The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, 3) Previous Experience, and 4) Price. Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Previous Experience, when combined, are more important than Price. 

****Under the Technical Capability factor, Greater consideration will be given to Contractors whose quote offers the following:

The ability to scan temperatures from 2 K to 300 K, and to control temperature with an instability and imprecision of at most 0.1 K.

The large diameter area for custom-made filters should be as large a possible; 75 to 100 square cm would be desirable.  This area does not have to be one contiguous area, but can be comprised of several individual areas.  As part of this requirement, a proposal to include hermetic SMA jack-to-jack coaxial feedthroughs at the vacuum flange would be desirable.

Turnaround time: smaller is better, with two hours being desirable.

Low noise: as low an audible noise level from pumps as possible.

Low size and weight; for example, 25 kg and 1.5 m high by 1 m wide.

Magnetic field: Magnetic field of at least 5 Tesla.

Unattended time: the system shall be capable to run for three days without operator intervention.

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product(s) meet or exceed the specifications stated above. 

****Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service, provided by the Contractor. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/ or information provided by NIST or its affiliates. Quoters shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold. The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name and address of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; and the date of delivery. 

***Past Experience shall be evaluated to determine the extent of the Contractor's experience of at least five (5) years in and knowledge in providing similar instrumentation. System shall have previously demonstrated long term ruggedness, durability and consistency. Evaluation of past experience may be based on contacts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its past experience information, if necessary. To allow assessment, each quote must include appropriate documentation. 

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

This solicitation is hereby amended to address questions/concerns from industry and to extend the due date for quotes.


Question:  Is homogeneity required or will our std spec be sufficient (standard spec. homogeneity over a 10mm Diameter sphere  .6%)?
Answer:   standard is fine.


Question:  Bore size
Answer:  Bore size is set by requirement of 50 square cm (required) and 75 - 100 square cm (greater consideration) area on the sample stage, as well as all other stages.


Question:  Field orientation
Answer:  Vendor's choice.


Question: Sample size
Answer:  Sample stage shall have a diameter of at least 10 cm (minimum), with at least 15 cm better (greater consideration).  However, we note that there is a tradeoff between sample stage size and total size/mass; vendors shall make the best combination of both specifications that they are able.


Question:  Cryostat Dimensions Tender requires 25 Kg x 1.5m high x 1m wide. The dimensions are similar to our standard system but the weight of the system required is 25Kg compared to 135Kg for our system.  Is 25Kg a typo on the tender? Can we quote something greater than 25Kg and not be penalized?
Answer:  25 kg is not an error; however, please note that this does not include the mass of any pumps, but only the mass of the cryostat (ie, Dewar and insert).

The specification for size and mass is listed in the "Greater consideration" section, not in the "minimum required technical specifications" section.  This answers the question regarding penalties.


The due date for quotes is hereby extended through Monday, September 8, 3:30:00PM EST.

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to indicate that an incorrect version of the specifications was posted to NRLs website and to answer questions from a prospective offeror.  A corrected version of the specifications is now available.  The link is repeated below for convenience:

http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/RFP/08kk06.htm

The questions and answers are as follows:

1.  We would like to get some more information on the design and dimensions of the chamber to which the new chamber needs to be connected. Can you provide a dimensional drawing of the existing V80 MBE machine? 

Drawings will posted to NRLs website on Monday, August 18, 2008.

2.  If drawings are not available, we need to know the following information:

a.	What is the size of the flange (of the preparation chamber) that will be used for attaching the new chamber?
 
      The flange at the end of the preparation chamber is an 8 OD Conflat flange.

b.	What is the diameter of the sample chamber?

The diameter of the preparation chamber is 12

c.	What is the sample loading position inside the preparation chamber (height from the laboratory floor assuming that the loading position is at the center of the chamber)?

The sample loading position is offset horizontally from the center of the preparation chamber.  The sample platen passes through the approximate center of the 8 flange.  The platen is approximately 46.75 ( 0.5") above the floor at the loading position.

d.	What is the amount of space available around the preparation chamber to attach the new chamber?

          The existing VG80H bench runs parallel to the prep chamber on one side.
          Its nearest approach to the center of the 8" flange is 21" horizontally and  
          12" vertically (below) from the center of the 8" flange. The bench extends  
          8" beyond the flange. An existing wall is 51" from the flange and 
          perpendicular to the axis of the prep chamber. These measurements are 
          believed to be accurate to within 0.5" (estimated).  However, this is not 
          expected to be a constraint, since NRLs laboratory will most likely need to 
          be re-arranged in any event.

e.	Can you provide a drawing of the V80 wafer carrier?

           A drawing of the VG80H wafer carrier will be posted to NRLs website on 
           Monday, August 18, 2008. The wafer is carried horizontally (epi face 
           down) on a trolley system. Transfer to and from the trolley is 
           accomplished with wobble sticks. 


3.  Can you grant an extension to the due date until August 25, 2008?
     
     No.  The solicitation will be extended until 4:00 pm. on Thursday, August 21,  
     2008.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4.5M annual gross receipts for a period of three years.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description
Project Name:  Madawaska Land Port of Entry (LPOE)
Building Type: Land Port of Entry
Location:  Madawaska, ME
Project Phase: Early Design
Approximate Area: 30,000 SF

Project Summary:   The project is for an LPOE facility of approximately 30,000 SF of building program located in Madawaska, Maine.  (See Appendix B).  The existing facility is located on less than 1 acre at the foot of the International Bridge (circa 1926) which spans the St. John River at the location of Madawaska, Maine (pop 7500) and Edmundston, New Brunswick  (pop 20,000).  The site is bounded by the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Rail Road (RR) which runs parallel to the top of the riverbank, and limits the existing LPOE site to approximately 150 of width.  Beyond the RR are located two large Fraser Nexfor Paper mills, which bracket Bridge Street as it ascends the hill to connect with US Route 1.  The current existing LPOE facility was constructed in the late 1950s, and is inadequate to accommodate current processing requirements.

The new facility program will bring CBP operations to current standard of performance, but requires significantly more site area to manage traffic for the multiple layers of inspection operations.  In order to manage this, GSA conducted an extensive search for suitable sites within the vicinity of the bridge.  A 10 acre site was identified approximately 3/8 mile from the bridge, which is the best option available.  The 10 acre site will require traffic to pass along a secure corridor along the riverbank, before passing over an elevated roadway (which will need to be constructed as part of the GSA/CBP project) across the RR right of way, to reach the new site, which is located on a plateau approximately 30 above the current facility.  A pedestrian processing facility will remain at the foot of the bridge to accommodate extensive pedestrian traffic between the towns and the mills.

A NEPA EIS study for this project was completed in 2007.  

Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

-	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical site, architectural,   
structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for communicating construction sequencing.  The model(s) will support services such as clash detection, and construction phasing.

-	To visualize, communicate, and validate the construction phasing schedule using 4D modeling

-	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in 
      sections 1.0-2.0 that will be incorporated into GSAs BIM Guide Series.  It is the 
      intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that 
      future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most 
      efficient manner.

Scope of Services:    The following sections describe the services requested through this solicitation.  As part of a BIM Modeling Plans (Section 3.1), the contractor shall coordinate and seek approval from the GSA COTR regarding the building elements to be modeled (e.g., object types, building elements, element attributes, and zones).  Information on the specified object types, elements, element attributes, and zones to be modeled will be provided to the contractor directly by GSA COTR as that information becomes available.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4.5M annual gross receipts for a period of three years.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE) , is requesting support  services for the Building Information Models (BIM)  for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the  the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description:
Project Name:  San Luis 2 Land Port of Entry (New Construction)
Building Type: Land Port of Entry (border station)
Location:  San Luis, AZ
Approximate Area:  Roughly 30,000 gsf spread among several small buildings, and approximately the same amount of additional square footage in the canopy areas.  
Year Built: Under construction, anticipated completion September 2009.

Project Summary:    This project is construction of a new land port of entry (border station) on the Arizona border with Mexico.  

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  


The phase of work covered by this solicitation is limited to creation of a mechanical, electrical and plumbing model, and population of applicable fields during the construction process as submittals identify specific products and installation details.  GSA shall provide a spatial program BIM, developed through Final Concept, as a basis for the MEP model.


Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

-  To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing objects for building services such as HVAC, BAS, and Lighting that may be utilized for building design, construction, and operation.  The model will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.  The model shall include several buildings within the Land Port of Entry.

-  To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS (which is an in-house developed application).  Systems integration with the GSA CMMS is not part of this scope.

-  To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSAs BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services:   The following sections describe the services requested through this solicitation.  The contractor shall coordinate and seek approval from the GSA COTR regarding the equipment object types, elements, element attributes, and zones to be modeled (these are defined later in this section).  Information on the specified equipment object types, elements, and element attributes, to be modeled will be provided to the contractor directly by GSA COTR as that information becomes available.  All services listed below include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series.

This BIM Scope of Work will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

1.0	Base Services

The contractor shall provide a BIM of the following components outlined in 1.1-1.7, using the existing spatial validation BIM as a starting point.  The contractor shall properly use available object information that embody information about the building component requirements and properties (e.g., construction materials, functional information, dimensions, etc).  Contractor shall coordinate with GSA to determine which buildings to model.
GSA shall provide the contractor with the 100% Construction Document AutoCAD files, the spatial validation BIM, and applicable MEP submittals (in either PDF or hard copy).  Submittals will be provided as they become available during construction.  Contractor shall assume that a Final Concept spatial program BIM (i.e., architectural and structural BIM) is available as a starting point.   

Contractor shall coordinate with GSA COTR to determine the exact mechanical, electrical, and plumbing objects to model.  

1.1.	Site 3D Model/BIM
The contractor shall provide a 3D model and/or BIM of the surrounding landscape, extending to the boundaries of the Port of Entry.

1.2.	MEP BIM

The contractor shall provide a MEP BIM that models the major object types for these disciplines.  Contractor shall model MEP objects both within each building, between buildings, and entering the site.  Contractor shall coordinate with GSA COTR to determine which objects to model in BIM.  Contractor shall assume 30 object types shall be modeled.

Example object types are:

Mechanical: package units and other heating/air conditioning units, pumps, fans, ducts, controls, etc.

Electrical: electric panels, fluorescent lighting, fiber optics cables, cable trays,
conduit, feeders, fire alarms, etc.

Plumbing: sprinkler systems, storage tanks, pumps, supply piping, transformers, gas lines, water supply piping, etc.

1.3.	Modeling of Required Building Equipment Attributes (Performance Requirements)

The contractor shall populate the building elements modeled with equipment information that captures the performance requirements specified by the design team.  In addition to the basic properties of name/description, dimensions, location, National CAD Standard acronym and OmniClass classification, an average of 15 equipment attributes (e.g. hp, gpm, rpm, power factor, etc.) should be anticipated for each object.

1.4.	National CAD Standard
To ensure stability and conformity throughout the life cycle of all assets and repairs, the GSA desires to create a standard system of acronyms based upon the National CAD to identify equipment.  The contractor shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to obtain the appropriate acronyms for the building equipment modeled.  This information will be included in the list of attributes that is assigned to the required building elements.

1.5.	OmniClass
The OmniClass Construction Classification System (known as OmniClass or OCCS) is a new classification system for the construction industry developed by the Construction Specification Institute (CSI).  It builds upon MasterFormat for work results, UniFormat for elements, and EPIC (Electronic Product Information Cooperation) for structuring products. OmniClass is a reference library that will serve as the foundation upon which information is transferred between the BIM, COBIE, and GSAs CMMS (see Section 6.0). The contractor shall include the appropriate OmniClass classification in the list of attributes that is assigned to the required building elements. The contractors(s) shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to ensure the correct application to OmniClass to the modeled elements.

1.6.	Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE)
The Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE) is a buildingSMART initiative of the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) Facility Maintenance and Operations Committee, the Facility Information Council, the International Alliance for Interoperability, and the National Building Information Model Standard. It is a federal government sponsored effort to support the development of BIM via information exchange between the construction and operations phases.  COBIE has several functions.  First, it serves as a repository for important equipment information, as does the BIM model.  Second, it allows for the collection and management of electronic construction submittals in various file formats, and enables the owner to ensure that the performance requirements for the project have been met.

The contractor shall coordinate the appropriate equipment information from the BIM with the COBIE system. As construction as-built data is submitted to COBIE by the general contractor, the BIM services contractor shall update the appropriate equipment attributes in the BIM model. The contractor shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to ensure the correct coordination between the BIM and COBIE.

Equipment information from COBIE and the BIM will be transferred directly into the GSA CMMS by the GSA facility management team.  The contractor will coordinate with the facility management team to ensure the information to be transferred is complete and in the correct format.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.

GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description: 
Project Name:  White Oak CUP  
Building Type: Central Utility Plant
Location:  White Oak, MD
Approximate Area: 50,000 GSF
Year Built: Became operational in 2003


Project Summary:   The White Oak CUP currently provides electric and hot water for the CDER laboratory and CDER Office.  This is a mechanical equipment building.  The Spatial Data Management (SDM) project is a national initiative of the GSA/ Public Buildings Service (PBS) to measure federally occupied space in its facilities, capture the information in a graphical database, establish business processes, and maintain the accuracy of this data over time.  The SDM project seeks to physically verify (measure and classify) the PBS space inventory and capture and maintain the resultant CAD libraries that shall be used as PBS's single trusted spatial data repository.  In addition, the SDM project records and maintains accurate agency assignment data.

GSA would like to perform a comparative study between traditional SDM techniques and deliverables, versus a BIM-based method utilizing laser scanning.  In addition, current GSA procedures do not adequately capture required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities via GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS).  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions.  The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for verification and comparison of spatial data and area measurements.  The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces. 

-  To generate a point cloud of the building interior and exterior for applications such as spatial data management, visualization, and facility management.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description: 
Project Name:  United States Custom House Envelope Repair 
Building Type: Custom House
Year Built:  1934
Location:  Downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Project Phase: The project is currently in the Programming Phase.  The Programming Phase will last approximately through October 2008.

Project Summary:    The United States Custom House was completed in 1934 and is seventeen-stories in height.  The building consists of a three-story base, stepping back to raise 14 additional stories as a cruciform tower.  Many decorative elements adorn the exterior of the building including eagles, shells, and sea creatures, symbols of the government, commerce, and maritime history.  There are a total of 8 different roofs and 1050 windows.  The Custom House is presently being considered to be named a national historic landmark. 

On the whole, the United States Custom House, which stands prominently in the oldest section of Philadelphia, is one of the best preserved and elaborate 20th century federal buildings in the city.  It represents a grand gesture to modernism, while relating to the scale and streetscape of the old city.

Base Building

The square, three-story Indiana limestone base of the Custom House is composed of two primary elements defined by the treatment and massing of the masonry and windows.  The lower base of the building extends from ground level to the masonry sill of the second story windows (Appendix A  Figure 1).  The masonry below the sill of the first floor windows is granite, while the remaining portion of the lower base is clad in seven courses of rusticated limestone blocks that are chamfered at the edges, which make the joints appear almost two-inches wide.  The massiveness of the lower base is accentuated by the deeply recessed arched window and door openings.  

Above and juxtaposed to the more massive lower base at the first-story is the visually lighter and attenuated upper base, which extends two stories high.  The second and third floors are configured as a single story by using ashlars limestone units with narrow flush joints, punctured by two-story-high steel window units.  Soapstone spandrel panels between the two stories, some carved with marine figures, appear to be integral to the window and screen the floor behind them.  A limestone parapet terminates the base of the building.  A carved limestone parapet and cornice caps the center and corner pavilions, while the areas in between are capped by a limestone parapet and cornice with brick inlay panels.  The seal of the United States is carved in the parapets at the center pavilions; while garland draped shields decorate the parapets at the corner pavilions.

The three-story base with projecting center entrance pavilions and secondary corner pavilions, of one bay each, is nearly identical on the North, East, and West Elevations.  The north and main entrance pavilion, facing Chestnut Street is the most prominent pavilion.  It consists of three arched door openings adorned with an eagle keystone above the arch.  Large aluminum relief panels fill the recessed arched openings.  In the center opening is the allegorical figure of America with an eagle, buffalo, and torch.  The east relief panel is a ship with nautical tools depicting American industry, while the west relief panel illustrates American agriculture.  

Flanking the three entry doors on the North Elevation are large freestanding, eight foot-high decorative octagonal aluminum lanterns.  

The Center Pavilions on the East and West Elevations are similar to the primary North Center Pavilion, but feature only one arched entry door with five windows above.  The seal of the Treasury Department with draping floral garlands adorn each arched doorway.  Smaller, wall-mounted octagonal aluminum lanterns flank the sides of these secondary entrances.  The aluminum relief panel in the west doorway depicts Asian culture and industry, while the relief panel on the east side represents European culture and industry.  

The South Elevation, designed as a loading dock, differs from the other elevations at the lower base only.  Between the corner pavilions is a wider, one-story, pavilion with seven arched entryways for vehicles.  The one-story pavilion is capped with a limestone parapet with brick inlay panels.

Lower Tower

Above the three-story base, the building step back and raises 14 additional stories as a cruciform tower.  The first and widest recessed blocks are two stories high, while the second and tallest rises six stories, and terminates in a parapet wall just above the 12th Floor (Appendix A  Figure 1).

Brick is the principal cladding material, but a central, slightly projecting limestone facing on the cardinal facades creates a bold white vertical skyscraper form that rises from the base of the building and extends continuously to the terra cotta sections and lantern at the top of the building.  The verticality of the tower form is juxtaposed to the wide horizontal limestone band at the tenth and eleventh floors which repeats and mirrors the bold horizontal limestone band at the base of the building with arched openings.  The eleventh floor consists of a limestone arcade of Romanesque windows with a limestone balustrade.  The tenth floor consists of a horizontal limestone belt course with brick, punctuated with octagonal-framed limestone bulls eyes or port holes, consistent with the nautical theme repeated throughout the building.

Upper Tower/Lantern

Above the 12th floor, the building steps back again in brick, with terra cotta used as the contrasting white material.  Originally, the terra cotta was almost identical in color to the limestone (Appendix A  Figure 1).

The upper tower is octagonal in plan with setback roofs.  In addition to the main (top) roof, there are five continuous setback roofs.  On the north, east, south, and west elevations there is an additional setback roof at the 15th floor.

At the 12th Floor is a terra cotta balustrade adorned with large ball finials and large winged terra cotta eagles at the corners.  The next setback raises two stories high with projecting terra cotta pavilions.  The two story-high window openings accentuate the verticality of the terra cotta spire.  The pavilions are capped with terra cotta parapet walls with ornate frieze panels and large urns.  Above the 15th floor rises the three-part terra cotta lantern with diagonal terra cotta tracery, a garland decorated frieze and large ball finials on the cornice.

Scope of Services

Objectives: The objectives for this requirement are: 

-  To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process.  The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the roof.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs. 

-  To generate a point cloud of the building exterior for applications such as archival, visualization, and site planning.

 -  To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSAs BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

DESCRIPTION OF AMENDMENT (Organized by UCF section headings, including solicitation/contract subject matter where feasible.). The purpose of this amendment is to publicize significant questions and answers resulting from this solicitation.The pose questions are followed by the government's responses.15A.  NAME AND TITLE OF SIGNER   (Type or print)	16A.  NAME AND TITLE OF CONTRACTING OFFICER   (Type or print)	15B.  CONTRACTOR/OFFEROR	15C.  DATE SIGNED	16B.  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	16C.  DATE SIGNED________________________________________________(Signature of person authorized to sign)		BY   _____________________________________________(Signature of Contracting Officer)	NSN 7540-01-152-8070	30-105	STANDARD FORM 30 (REV. 10-83)PREVIOUS EDITION UNUSABLE		                      Computer Generated	      Prescribed by GSA/FAR (48 CFR) 53.243   TECHNICAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERSSOLICITATION NO. VA 101-08-RP-0784All questions are stated exactly as posed to VA."	We are under the assumption that the VA will cover all research costs for the benchmark companies other than travel for the conference - just want to confirm.  Yes.  The government will cover the travel cost as indicated in the solicitation.  It reads as follows: PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND TRAVELThe principal places of performance shall be at the Contractor's facility.  However, the Contractor shall be available for face-to-face meetings, briefings, and consultations as directed by the COTR.Some performance will be required at various other locations.  Travel will be required at least twice within each phase.  The probable location will be Washington, DC and/or two other locations within the East Cost.  Offerors may include a not-to-exceed allotment of $1,2OO.00 per trip in their proposal.  This figure includes all travel and per diem costs necessary to comply with the requirements.    "	In examining pages 9-12 we think that a few items may be out of order but we're not 100% sure. On page 9, phase 1, task 2 seems to match phase 2 on page 6. Also on page 9, Phase 1 tasks 2 and 3 seem to match Phase 3 on page 6.  Page 6 speaks to the overall intent of the Benchmarking study, whereas Page 9 breaks down each task associated with the overall intent by phases. "	We were curious as to why the deliverables on the various studies for example the workforce planning report (180 days) and the recruitment report (210 days) are staggered?  We wanted to allow time for the prospected vendors to provide a detailed report by the different areas included in the study.  "	Has the VA done any preliminary work with respect to identifying potential benchmark companies or would you like the contractor to bring reputable companies to the table? We have an extensive list of reputable clients but wanted to check first before contacting them of their potential interest.  We will welcome a list of reputable companies for the study.  The VHA will ultimately determine the companies to be included in the study."	Based on the information provided, this study is to assess the various recruitment, retention, leadership development, supervisory training, employee morale and satisfaction, and workforce diversity programs at VHA; not the participants of these programs (VHA organization). Please confirm.   You are correct.  However, VA cannot rule out having a few interviews. "	Based on the information provided, collaboration with the VHA to identify and forge relationships with the benchmark partners is a Phase 1 activity; not to be done prior to Phase 1? Please confirm.   That is correct. "	Have incentives for the benchmark partners to be involved in this process and to share their internal metrics with VHA been determined? If so, what are the incentives?   Incentives have not been discussed at this juncture.   "	What is the anticipated start date for Phase 1?   30 days after award."	An additional question I have is about meeting the Conflicts of  interest requirement and materials to substantiate abilities. If there is no conflict do we still have to respond that there is no conflict (not sure how or where you like to see this in the proposal).   Yes. "	On Page 44 there is a request to offerors to substantiate their abilities by submitting materials. Did the VA have something particular in mind such as past studies? We ask this only because the RFP indicates not to exceed 15 pages and we have several studies. Is it OK to bypass the 15 pages as long as materials are referenced as appendices or would the VA prefer no more than 15 pages altogether?    Information should be limited to 15 pages.  We are interested in knowing the results of previous benchmarking studies, types of customers, and any material that would demonstrate your proficiency in conducting the type of study that the VHA is seeking."	Are we correct to assume the Detailed Plan is analogous to a Technical Approach?  Yes"	There is no mention of resumes in the solicitation. Should resumes of key staff be included with the response? If yes, can we assume they are excluded from the 15 page limitation?  Resumes should be included.  We can exclude the resumes from the 15 page limit."	Please confirm that the OCI statement and the company experience checklist are not included in the page limitation.  They can be excluded."	Given the complexity and uncertainties of the tasks required (for example - outcome of phase 1 will be "an assessment tool/methodology as data system acceptable to VA and benchmark partners") has the government given any consideration to awarding this work as a Time & Materials contractThis will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract."	Is the goal of this solicitation to benchmark and evaluate succession planning at the VHA headquarters level, regional level, hospital level, other levels or all levels of management within VHA?  The goal is to benchmark succession planning VHA System-wide. "	Page 9, table rows 2 and 3.  These statements call for "utilization and facilitation of the tool within VHA and pre-selected companies and issuance of the report [and] summary of raw data at the end of the report", followed by "assessment of the results to include reporting mechanism and implementation suggestions", respectively due 60 and 90 days after award.  Based on the Background and the Scope of Work described beginning page 13 of the RFP, however, it is understood that surveying VHA and other companies would not take place until Phase 2 of the project, three months after award, with outcome of a "report of data to include raw dataand summary report".  Please clarify the intent for the Phase 1 tasks and deliverables.  The intend of Phase 1 is to prepare the tools necessary to conduct the benchmarking study.   Also to work closely with an expert VHA panel to identify Benchmarking partners.  Additionally to determine methodology for using the tool.    Phase 1 is to do all of the pre-work in preparation for the study."	Re: the statement in the Scope of Work, Phase 2 (page 16 of the RFP), "surveying VHA and other companies will take approximately six months from the time VA approves the start of this work".  Timelines shown for Phase 2 on pp. 9 - 12 do not seem to be consistent with six months from the time the VA approves the start of this work. Are the timelines on pp. 9-12 as the government intends? In addition, does the government mean for individual analyses to be structured chronologically as shown in the table or can the contractor suggest conducting these analyses concurrently? Please clarify.  VA management will consider adjusting the due date--if necessary.  "	Page 12, top row of the table.  This appears to be a Phase 2 task, not Phase 3 as shown.  Is this correct?  The need for changes will be reviewed by the VA. "	Page 45, Factor 5.  Please clarify the intent behind this evaluation factor related to laws and regulations related to the management and administration of information security.  The intend here is to make sure the prospective vendors have knowledge of Federal Law and regulations and is able to comply with the management and administration of information security.  We also want to insure that the prospective vendors have a thorough understanding of USC Title 5 and USC Title 38 laws and regulations, Privacy Act regulations, and Information Security. Bottom line, we want to protect privacy data and maintain information security.     "	Page 7 calls for a "Facilitated conference with all study participants to review results and assessment of each participant." Some benchmarked organizations not want or be able to share information with other participants because of privacy rules. Is it the government's intent that the contractor makes willingness to share information with other organizations a condition of selection for each benchmarked entity?    Yes.    The due date for offers is changed to:  Friday, August 22, 2008, 10:00 am Local Time.All other conditions, provisions, and terms remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

Background. 

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), on behalf of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) hosted an Industry Day July 8, 2008 prior to soliciting proposals for innovative, creative, and high-risk research to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for the Analysis WorkSpace for Exploitation (A-SpaceX) program. The anticipated BAA will address Phase 1 of what is being conceived as a multi-phase program. A BAA is expected to be released following the Industry Day, and will provide additional details regarding the research opportunities within this program. The BAA will solicit proposals for conducting critical research and development for what is planned as the first phase of a multi-phase, multi-million dollar program. Phase 1 will have an expected performance period of 18 months, and would culminate with a technology showcase for the benefit of potential users and system integrators. Succeeding phases would focus on developing integrated systems.  Formal proposals will be reviewed by an IARPA selection committee based on source selection criteria to be published as part of the BAA. Separate proposals may be submitted for different requirements with the thrust areas, e.g., Time Machine and MindSnaps. We anticipate initial contract awards will be made by the first quarter of 2009.  AFRL is expected to be the Contracting Authority for the planned work, while IARPA will be responsible for technical oversight and the BAA solicitation process.

Overview: 

A-SpaceX is seeking to create an analytic environment where the workspace becomes an enabler for the analytic process  fostering creativity and effective analytic reasoning. A-SpaceX envisions two key emerging technologies being fused for the intelligence analyst workstation of the future: Virtual worlds, and Workflow management. 
Analysts will work with an integrated workstation that not only allows access to the legacy tools of today, but any number of virtual worlds designed to support the analytic process. Virtual worlds are defined here as: 1) Complex multi-dimensional digital environments (i.e. models) that are shared across many users; 2) They may incorporate data models from a variety of sources, made up of objective data as well as hypothetical and/or theoretical constructs; and 3) Both persist and evolve whether or not any individual user is actively engaged with that world. A-SpaceX will demonstrate that this technology affords transformational opportunities to change the way people work in general, and how analysts will work in particular. Synthetic worlds will be multi-dimensional, dynamic visualizations of data tailored to support different analytic problems. A-SpaceX anticipates focusing of the development of two Synthetic worlds that will: 1) Highlight the dynamic aspects of both factual and synthetic (hypothetical) data and models and the benefits of combining them in an integrated representation that provides a meaningful context; 2) Allows the changes in the data to be systematically explored so as to facilitate both forensic and proactive analysis; 3) Show the dynamic aspects of cognition, specifically the process of thinking about data as reflected by capturing decision states that can serve as mental bookmarks for the analytic process; and 4) Demonstrate how groups of analysts can collaborate in the exploration of data and the sharing of analytic strategies. 

The A-SpaceX vision allows for multiple synthetic worlds, each of which is optimized to support different kinds of analytic decision-making. Multiple synthetic worlds will be optimized for different analytic problems. The incorporation of multiple, coherent virtual worlds will require that there be a consistent set of protocols and usability standards to ensure that analysts may readily jump from one world to the next as needed to support exploring complex, inter-related data. 

Implicit in the A-SpaceX vision is premise that changes in the data used in defining a synthetic world will be available to automated agents working on behalf of the analyst to both find relevant information, and highlight when the data (already integrated into analytic products derived from that synthetic world) have changed. Accommodation for legacy software applications and analytic tools will be integrated into the workspace through the incorporation of proximal displays located on desktops close to the analysts, while exploration in parallel synthetic worlds will be available through distal displays on the periphery of the analysts workspace will serve as windows into the synthetic world. Though used for different purposes, the proximal and distal displays will be part of a single integrated digital desktop so that no matter how physical displays are used, the moving of information from one display area to another is as seamless as possible.

Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program as currently conceived will have two major thrusts: 1) The research and development of key science and technologies to create a Time Machine synthetic world that allows complex data to be explored in a rich context, as well as allowing changes in data to be explored over time.  2) The research and development of science and technologies for tracking an analysts workflow to derive MindSnaps, or mental bookmarks that reflect key aspects of an analysts decision-making process in conducting analyses, as well as the development of a Decision Space virtual world designed to enable and analysts visualizing his or her own analytic process via MindSnaps. Time Machine and MindSnaps development is dependent upon a Synthetic World foundation which includes an over-arching concept of operations for the employment of virtual worlds as part of the analytic infrastructure, along with the definition of prospective architectures for the use of synthetic worlds with legacy software and hardware infrastructure. 

Time Machine Thrust. 

Virtual worlds are in fact models that have several relevant properties: they can be shared by multiple people, they are persistent, and they evolve over time. We anticipate that a virtual world may be built based on data derived from the physical world, as well as including models, events and other factual data. In addition, the data may be updated as a model, it is possible to systematically explore temporal aspects of change of data and events that occur in the physical world. Forensic analysis can be performed by replicating the real world in a synthetic world. In this forensic mode, alternative explanations can be explored by adjusting assumptions and the quality index of the collected data and allowing the changes to propagate into the future. Proactive analysis could be explored by applying predictive models that look forward in time and suggest indicators leading to future events.
Virtual worlds are interesting as they allow the representation of complex, n-dimensional data sets; they can be shared by multiple people, and they evolve over time. In developing synthetic worlds to facilitate analysis, one of the more interesting aspects of synthetic worlds will be their ability to explore how data changes, and therefore the  implications of that change can be used in formulating hypotheses about, and explanations of, change. We believe a key dimension of exploring changing data will be the ability to manipulate time in the synthetic worlds  in effect turning these worlds into Time Machines. The use of synthetic worlds as Time Machines is conceptually about the explorations of data, and as such, may be (but need not be) tied to a physical location. These synthetic worlds will allow a variety of data abstractions to be embedded, layered, and compared. A critical issue in creating a Time Machine capability will be the ability to detect and manage significant changes from data. A-SpaceX will seek research and development for technologies that will address contextually relevant change detections and management from raw data streams. Further, the complexity of the data sets possible in synthetic worlds for analysis suggest that tools to optimize how those worlds work and appear for specific analytic problems will require the development of context lens & filters that will make it possible to highlight, distort or block different kinds of data within a synthetic world. 

The CONOP for Time Machines is expected to transform how analysts would explore data. For instance, analysts would begin their analytic work by selecting a here and now where they pick a perspective of interest from which to explore the data sets represented within a synthetic world. The analysts would then assess possible futures relative to their chosen perspective in place and time.  This would become the basis for  effectively assessing the possibilities for a then and there relative to the here and now and developing potential hypotheses for what is possible in the future given what is known and unknown from the here and now. Another analytic CONOP might be that analysts would hypothesize a discrete (specific) future and then assess the viability of that hypothesis by exploring both known and unknown data represented in the synthetic world. In effect, the Time Machine CONOP would allow analysts to engage in forensic and proactive analysis, by viewing past/future perspectives.

MindSnaps Thrust. 

Current information technology is completely agnostic regarding helping an analyst to perform work. The burden is on the analyst to use tools to annotate, organize, and associate their work products. The analysts workflow process is complicated by methodology practices and security requirements of the IC that add even more tedious and time consuming activities. Today, there is no formal or proscribed mechanism for tracking analytic workflow. Current automation limitations make it extremely difficult for analysts to remember, find, and return to their analytic decision points to reconsider information changes, or try alternative hypotheses. None the less, analysts have to explain, share and propagate work products with supporting rationale to peers and managers. 

The analytic process is inherently iterative and fractionated. The analyst will typically think 
about one aspect of analytic problem until it is no longer fruitful, new data comes in, or a new facet of the problem becomes more salient. Analytic decision making is iterative because the analyst will often return to a previous point in his or her thinking and resume analysis from that point in time until a solution is found to the analytic problem. We believe that there is a theoretical and technological basis to monitor an analysts workflow, and detect when the analyst has shifted their decision trajectory while engaged in this iterative, fractionated process. Further, when a shift in decision trajectory is detected, the system would collect meta-data regarding the analysts workspace including what software applications were in use, where they were located and the data sets open in those applications. By examining the work that was being done before the decision trajectory shifted, it should be possible to extract meta-knowledge about what the analyst was doing during that period of analysis. The meta-knowledge would become the basis for creating a meaningful abstraction to summarize that decision trajectory. Together, the meta-data about the workspace and the meta-knowledge data would be combined to create a MindSnap. MindSnaps will be the basis for the creation of mental bookmarks of an analysts decision making. A-SpaceX seeks to develop a research thrust that explores creating a synthetic world that is based on MindSnaps and facilitates an analysts exploring the analytic process tied to a problem of interest.  This  "Decision Space" synthetic world effectively maps the overall decision-making processes of analysts as graphical decision nodes, and allows them to find and, cognitively re-load their workstation from different points in their own analytic process. 
Common to both the development of Time Machine and MindSnap capabilities will be the development of an overarching concept of operations (CONOP) and a shared HumanComputer Interface for the use of synthetic worlds as analytic tools. Further, the application of current virtual world technologies to support the proposed CONOP will require the adaptation of current virtual world technologies. The A-SpaceX program will likely, therefore, include a systems engineering task to address the common information technologies anticipated as being required for the use of synthetic worlds in support of the analytic tasks. During Phase 1 of the A-SpaceX program, we anticipate that these tasks will be largely limited to the definition of coherent CONOP as well as architecting the requirements for supporting systems architectures. There may be limited development of those services and the definition of knowledge representation in support of the critical services identified as being required for the A-SpaceX CONOP. 

Summary. 

An A-SpaceX Phase 1 Industry Day was held on July 8, 2008 .  The purpose of  Industry Day was to provide the A-SpaceX vision and concepts / ideas that may appear in the BAA, and solicit feedback from potential performers on key ideas and technical challenges. Parties still interested in participating in the A-SpaceX program or commenting on the program described above are welcome to communicate with the A-SpaceX team prior to the publishing of a BAA by sending an e-mail to: DNI-IARPA-ASPACEX@UGOV.GOV. You will then be contacted to arrange a brief conference call with the A-SpaceX management team. Please be advised, the management team cannot discuss or evaluate specific research or proprietary technologies.  Conversations relating to the A-SpaceX vision, general research A-SpaceX interests, or potential technical / theoretical challenges and significant development milestones are encouraged. 

We cannot control the types of problems that future analysts might face. We cannot control the demands for understanding information and the pressure for faster decision making. We can, however, provide the analyst with an environment that encourages creativity, reasoning, collaboration with internal and external experts, rapid exploration of alternate perspectives for greater understanding, and detecting change in data and through processes within a multi-dimensional information rich synthetic world. Welcome to A-SpaceX where its about the future.

(APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.

(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). 
(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override. 
(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.
(g)	Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) PH.# 435-8312107, FAX# 435-831-2085.

12.	Hardened chassis 
13.	Mobile
14.	Interchangeable parts with existing machines
15.	Ergonomic design
16.	Batteries

Regulatory Requirements:  The Mobile DR X-Ray Units and all of their components, shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

There are not set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 621512.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>Amendment No. 0001 to the Solicitation No. DG133E-08-RP-0140 has been issued.&nbsp; The date for receipt of proposals has been extended from August 18, 2008, to September 22, 2008, 3:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>This notice is being amended to correct the following sentence from the last paragraph,&nbsp;line nine, "The Contractor shall provide and support the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract." to "The Contractor shall provide and support the installation, operation, and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract." The word "design"&nbsp; has been deleted from the sentence.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Systems (NESDIS) Office of Satellite Operations has a requirement to design, install, operate and maintain the IJPS Network Communications Element. <br />The Office of Satellite Operations (OSO) of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) currently operates a joint Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program in conjunction with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). This joint system consists of two fully coordinated independent polar satellite systems that are referred to as the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS). As part of their IJPS operations, OSO currently provides telecommunications, networking, and Network Operating Center (NOC) capabilities to support the mission. As part of a new contract for the existing services provided to support the mission, OSO is looking for information and innovative capabilities from industry that will enable it to continue its current mission and enhance the service offerings for telecommunications and NOC services.
<p>Communications Services: <br />The contractor shall be able to operate an IJPS Network that will provide commercial-grade data communications capabilities within the network using industry standard network components and protocols. The IJPS network will consist of a communications link between Suitland (Maryland) and Darmstadt (Germany) that can handle a data throughput rate of at least 45 Mbps. The IJPS Network will also provide a backup link from Darmstadt to Suitland to handle telemetry and command data flows between Wallops Island (Virginia) and Darmstadt (Germany). In addition, the IJPS Network will consist of out-of-band communication links to handle the network management capabilities of the NOC.</p>
<p>NOC Services: <br />The contractor shall provide managed security services to monitor on a 24/7/365 basis IJPS Network and OSO enterprise networking equipment, such as spanning servers, switches/routers, firewall, servers, and network intrusion detection in Suitland (Maryland) , Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska). The NOC shall provide rapid notification and reporting of both system operational availability and/or system security issues following detection of a component failure or security intrusion incident.</p>
<p>The overall security categorization for the IJPS Ground System is:<br />SC IJPS = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}</p>
<p>Therefore, the contractor shall meet Federal Security Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 800-53-A controls for high security system at the NOC. The NOC service features shall also include, but are not limited to, Event Correlation across devices, Automated Inventory Audit and Reporting, Patch Management, and Vulnerability and Penetration Testing. The NOC services will be required to provide backup NOC operations at another location.</p>
<p>Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services: <br />The contractor shall provide O&amp;M services for the OSO enterprise networking infrastructure that supports IJPS operations. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to networking switching, routers, intrusion detection devices, firewalls, and telecommunications devices. The services will include, at a minimum, staging, configuration, updates, firewall rules changes and management. The contractor will also be responsible for preventative maintenance and equipment lifecycle management. The OSO enterprise networking infrastructure is operating in Suitland (Maryland), Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska).</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall provide O&amp;M service to software applications for NOAA servers in Darmstadt that receive and forward satellite data and products from Darmstadt to Suitland. Services to be provided include modification of a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) software application product to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment.<br />The contract will be for a base year of twelve (12) months plus four (4) one-year option periods. The Contractor shall provide and support the installation, operation and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract. The NAICS Code is 517919. This requirement will be competed using full and open competition procedures pursuant to FAR Part 6.1.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement for Organizational Level Aircraft Maintenance Services in support of the United States Marine Corps Aviation RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J, AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support shall be required both inside and outside CONUS at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, NC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, Japan; MCAS Iwakuni, Japan; and Al Asad Air Base, Iraq.The primary goal of the RESET project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the project shall employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which shall include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program shall feature three distinct RESET events:

(1) A PRESET, which shall be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT, which shall be performed as needed on deployed aircraft in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET; and
(3) A RECONSTITUTION, which shall be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines.  This goal shall be accomplished by allowing contractors to perform General Organizational Level Maintenance tasks when they are not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $6.5M.  The Product Service Code for this requirement is J015.

This project is the Marine Corps first attempt at an organized, centrally-managed RESET Program.  However, a number of the platforms and locations listed above have active or recent contracts for PRESET, IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT, and/or RECONSTITUTION services, or active or recent contracts for Engineering and Technical Services, or General Organizational Level Maintenance, under which RESET-related tasking is being performed.  The following is a list of such contracts:

On 1 November 2007, NAWCAD issued a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of this requirement.  NAWCAD received thirty-five (35) responses to this notice.  These thirty-five responses included responses from:

- (18) Small Businesses (2 capable)
- (6) 8(a) Small Businesses (2 capable)
- (5) HUBZone Small Businesses (0 capable)
- (5) Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (1 capable)
- (10) Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (1 capable)
- (4) Woman-Owned Small Businesses (0 capable)

Two or more Small Businesses were determined to be capable on the following aircraft platforms: AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-53D/E.  Two or more 8(a) Small Businesses were determined to be capable on the following aircraft platform: CH-46E.  Two or more Small Businesses were not determined to be capable on the following platforms: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J and MV-22.  Based on this information, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has determined that a set-aside for Small Business is appropriate for the AH-1W, UH-1N and CH-53D/E platforms, that an 8(a) competition is appropriate for the CH-46E platform, and that Full and Open Competition is appropriate for the AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J and MV-22 platforms.  The NAVAIR Small Business Office concurs with this decision.

NAWCAD intends to release a single competitive solicitation featuring split contract awards.  NAWCAD may award as few as one (1), or as many as five (5) contracts.  The following aircraft platforms shall be grouped together in the solicitation:

Group 1: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B (Full & Open Competition)
Group 2: KC-130J (Full & Open Competition)
Group 3: AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-53D/E (Small Business Set-Aside)
Group 4: CH-46E (8(a) Competition)
Group 5: MV-22 (Full & Open Competition).

Each contract shall provide for RESET services at all required locations, both CONUS and OCONUS, for the applicable platforms.  In order to provide stability, continuity and flexibility to the Marine Corps, each contract shall consist of a base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  This requirement shall be awarded on a predominantly Firm Fixed Price basis, although the contract may contain some Labor Hour and Cost-Type elements to address secondary goals.  All responsible sources may submit proposals in response to the solicitation, which the Government shall consider.

NAWCAD expects that a Draft of the Solicitation (excluding Sections L&M) shall be available to industry in mid-April.  When the draft becomes available, NAWCAD shall post it to the FBO website or to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) website at the following URL:
http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm
The official Solicitation shall be made available through the NAVAIR website at the above URL.
NAWCAD also intends to host an Industry Day forum for this requirement.  Additional information concerning this forum shall be posted to FBO in the near future.  NAWCAD intends to make award on this requirement in the December 2008 timeframe.

Questions concerning this synopsis should be submitted in writing to Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the email addresses cited below.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.  Any requests for contract documents shall be filed with the appropriate agencies in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be sent through email.&nbsp; No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>
<p>The National Development Branch (NDB), a software development and integration component under the Rural Development Chief Information Officer, is looking to replace a legacy client/server application with a web-based solution for assembling electric and telecommunications borrower loan documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current system allows users to answer a "survey" about the type of loan, loan period, locale where the loan is requested, and other pertinent data about the borrower to generate a set of loan documents in Wordperfect format that are then reviewed, approved, printed (to a central printer), and sent to the various borrowers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system is on antiquated hardware on a software infrastructure that is no longer supported.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is desired to replace this system with a more modern, extensible architecture that can not only support loan documents, but can also assist in the preparation of other similar types of documents; as examples, Foreclosure documents, requests for proposal, and contract documentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has launched the Pre-positioned Equipment Program (PEP).   PEP consists of standardized equipment Pods that are located in designated geographic areas to permit rapid deployment of equipment and personnel to incidents involving the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).In eight (8) planned locations Nationwide, commercial off the shelf equipment items will be stored in pods, transportable by land or air within 1 to 12 hours after help is requested.  This equipment is specially tailored to sustain and reconstitute the capabilities of Federal, State and local first responders to react to WMD events.  Through formal request and deployment procedures, the Federal Government will transfer PEP pods to specifically designated officials.A total of eight (8) operational PEP sites have been established, along with one (1) Special Events Pod (SEP).  Strategically placed throughout the country, these equipment pods will be available to respond to an incident in any major population center across the continental U.S. within 12 hours.  The FEMA plan provides for immediate ground or air transportation of the first pod, including a team of support staff.  If circumstances warrant an even greater level of support, FEMA may dispatch additional, fully-equipped pods to the site, either by ground or air. It is anticipated that the Government will award a single contract with a base and four option years, that will contain firm-fixed price and time and material line items. This is a best value acquisition; therefore Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest-priced Offeror. To be eligible for award, all Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Information on the CCR may be obtained at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil . Once issued, the RFP may be viewed on the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center  Natick Contracting Division webpage at https://www3.natick.army.mil on or about 15 September 2008.
