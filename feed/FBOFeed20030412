If the contracting officer does not satisfy your concerns, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.

When requested, Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals in the Source Selection process.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
