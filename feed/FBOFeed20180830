<DESC>The Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLCMC/LPKPB) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma plan to negotiate a requirements type contract for the acquisition of Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) for USAF engines (F101-102, F110-100, F110-129, F118-100 and TF39).  The requirement will be to provide Block Cycle Updates (BCU's) and sustainment support of IETM technical orders and Portable Document Format (PDF) support for distribution and/or printing along with IETM system improvements and functionalities and future enhancements to the system.  Contract intended to be ONE BASE year with FOUR one year options.  In the event the government has sufficient data at the end of any one year to make future actions competitive, the option years will not be utilized.  This is a sole source acquisition and award will be conducted and evaluated under the provisions of FAR Part 15.  The responsible offeror must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA)database (available at http?//orca.bpn.gov/) and submit a completed copy with their quote.  The offeror must also be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database (available at www.sam.gov).  Lack of registration in SAM will qualify contractor as ineligible for award.  Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification:  Services required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contraction action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government does NOT own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase this requirement.

<p>Advanced Industrial Base Analysis Services for Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors Systems (IEW&amp;S)</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W909MY-18-R-H007</p>
<p>North American Industrial Classification System Code: 541990</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division, on behalf of PEO IEW&amp;S intends to negotiate with A.T. Kearney Public Sector and Defense Services, LLC (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;ATK'), 1300 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1050 Arlington, Virginia 22209 as a sole source in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), to procure Advanced Industrial Base Analysis Services for PEO IEW&amp;S. The action proposed is a firm-fixed-price (FFP) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) single award contract for analyses, studies, assessments, and initiatives that cover a wide range of areas related to improving effectiveness, efficiency, cost, capacity, capability and affordability in design, manufacturing, and support.</p>
<p>The proposed award will consist of a twelve (12) month base ordering period with a maximum ceiling amount of $6,707,125.00 and a six (6) month ordering period with a maximum ceiling of $3,454,070.00.  The anticipated award date is fourth quarter fiscal year (FY) 2018.  <br /> <br />The required services are in support of the PEO IEW&amp;S mission.  PEO IEW&amp;S provides affordable, world-class sensor and electronic warfare capabilities, enabling rapid situational understanding and decisive actions. Only ATK's extensive Industrial Base Study experience, extensive knowledge of the PEO IEW&amp;S portfolio, and unique architecture evaluation model make it uniquely qualified to support PEO IEW&amp;S and the full scope of the requirements.  ATK has the unique capabilities to successfully complete analyses, studies, assessments, and initiatives that cover a wide range of areas related to improving effectiveness, efficiency, cost, capacity, capability and affordability in design, manufacturing, and support. A market research analysis revealed several duplicative costs along with an unacceptable delay caused by competing the efforts.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
