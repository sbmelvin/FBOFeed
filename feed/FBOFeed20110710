<DESC>Request for Information VA-701-11-RI- 0360

Integrated Ethics Web

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified GSA Schedule or open market contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, understand GSA Schedule pricing and discount practices and other market information readily available.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for Integrated Web Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The objective of this project is to improve and enhance the Ethics Consultation Web (ECWeb) system.  This includes integration of a number of enhancements as well as an upgrade from ColdFusion 8 to ColdFusion 9, and an upgrade of the database from SQL Server 2000 to 2005.
ECWeb is currently being used by approximately 1,800 users across 140 VA health care facilities.  It is currently hosted by VA WebOps in Falling Waters, WV.  The program enables ethics consultants at the national and local level to monitor their ethics consultations, adhere to guidance about best practices for ethics consultation, and generate various types of reports.  Ethics consultation in VHA is conducted according to the standards laid out in Ethics Consultation: Responding to Ethics Questions in Health Care (http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/integratedethics/Ethics_Consultation_Responding_to_Ethics_Questions_in_Health_Care_20070808.pdf)  and associated ethics consultation tools (http://www.ethics.va.gov/integratedethics/ECC.asp) developed by NCEHC.  ECWeb has been in use by the NCEHC since 2001 and all VHA facilities since 2007.  A user's overview of ECWeb is available at (http://www.ethics.va.gov/integratedethics/ECWeb.asp).
In addition to enhancement and upgrade of ECWeb, the selected contractor will develop a second component called Preventive Ethics Web (PEWeb), based on specifications and requirements provided by VA subject matter experts.  Those specifications and requirements will be drawn from the guidance and tools developed by the NCEHC to govern Preventive Ethics in VHA (see http://www.ethics.va.gov/integratedethics/PEC.asp).
The ECWeb and PEWeb components will, together, be known as IntegratedEthics Web (IEWeb).  Ethics Consultation and Preventive Ethics in VHA are two functions of a larger initiative in VHA, IntegratedEthics.  IntegratedEthics was recently named as one of the top 25 innovative government programs in 2011 through the Harvard-Ash Innovations in American Government Award.  There is considerable national and international interest in IntegratedEthics and ECWeb outside of the federal sector.
Scope of Work: 
A contractor is being sought to revise a currently implemented web-based system called Ethics Consultation Web (ECWeb).  The contractor shall also create a second parallel component called Preventive Ethics Web (PEWeb).  Together, the system will be known as IntegratedEthics Web (IEWeb).  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this RFI.

<DESC>Request for Proposal for Developing a Hood River Kelt Management Plan<br />Geographical restriction:&nbsp; Consultant must have a physical location in the Northwest<br /><strong><br />Background of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission<br /></strong>In 1977, four Columbia River treaty tribes including the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, formed the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources and to protect their reserved treaty rights through the exercise of inherent sovereign powers of the tribes.&nbsp; The organization conducts business through one joint decision-making body referred to as the "Commission", which is made up of the respective tribe's fish and wildlife representatives, and operates on a consensus basis.&nbsp; The tribe's decision making authority is based in part on reserved treaty right in the Columbia Basin, statutes, case law and derivative documents such as The Pacific Salmon Treaty, and In-Lieu Sites legislation.&nbsp; Coordination with each tribe's respective fisheries management helps keep CRITFC aligned with tribal programs.&nbsp; CRITFC is the only existing organization which represents these tribes in treaty fishery related matters and has been a cornerstone for many successes in the restoration of salmon and the protection of treaty rights. You can find more information about CRITFC at <a href="http://www.critfc.org">www.critfc.org</a>.<br /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><strong>Scope of services<br /></strong>The remainder of this RFQ requests your response to certain questions.&nbsp; Please limit your responses to the specific questions.<br />1.
