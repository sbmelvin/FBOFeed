<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), has a requirement to acquire a one year renewal for IQS Business System Maintenance and Technical Support for a 20 license system. Implementation services purchased include additional licenses; consulting services – on-site and off-site; certified on-site training and report writing. The purpose of this project is to position FDA for a phased implementation of an ISO 17025-accreditable lab quality system to support FDA/CBER’s regulatory testing program. Activities of the project involve working discussions with a limited group (5 to 6) of CBER’s employees regarding initial plan for development and implementation of the following modules: employee skills and training (IQS Involve); equipment management (IQS Prevent & Calibrate); Product & Data Collection (IQS Product & Collect). It is anticipated that this award will be made on a sole source basis to IQS, Inc. Cleveland, Ohio,  because the software/licenses being used is proprietary to IQS and they are the only company that has the expertise/skills required to maintain the software/equipment.  They are the only vendor that can provide the necessary on-site/off-site training for usage of this software.  This requirement is a renewal of an ongoing need for constant consultation/training regarding the usage and updates of the software currently being used.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial items identified below, prepared in  accordance with the format  in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number: 4011265150-00023, is issued as a Request for Quotation  (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22(B).  The U.S. Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland intends to procure the following two lined items as a sole source procurement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) where there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's needs can be satisfied by one responsible source and no other instrument will satisfy U.S. Department of Agriculture's requirement.  U.S. Department of Agriculture  intends to procure the following instrument: (LINED ITEM 1):  "Portable Fourier Transform ("FTIR") Mid-Infrared Spectrometer", Part Number: 0400-0000, Manufactured by "Surface Optics Corporation", -  who are located at 11555 Rancho Bernardo Road in San Diego, California – and they can be reached at phone number 858-675-7404.  The above instrument shall be used to compliment existing laboratory instruments by allowing the scanning  in the mid-infrared of samples on site without the need to necessarily remove the sample from it's environment ("In-Situ").  The above instrument shall also be able to compliment the existing instruments available from the "Remote  Sensing and Hydrology Laboratory" at U.S. Department of Agriculture – which can perform the same function for the near-infrared spectral range.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) has a requirement to conduct an economic analysis to measure benefits of right whale protection in the Northwest Atlantic. The purpose of this contract is to attain the services of a contractor with expertise in non-market valuation methods (contingent valuation, contingent choice methods or experimental economics) to develop a long-term study/strategic plan that includes an economic measure of willingness-to-pay (WTP) for right whale protection.  The overall study effort will be divided into three main phases:  Phase 1 (Year 1) - Pre-design; Phase 1 (Year 2) - Design survey instrument (optional); Phase 2 - Survey implementation (optional); and Phase 3  - Final analysis of survey data and final report (optional).  Phase 1 encompasses the development of a research team and design of a survey instrument to the point where it can be implemented in Phase 2.  Phase 1 will be spread over a two-year period with the second year optional.   The goal of the first year pilot project, the pre-design step, is to specify the overall design of a long-term project to be conducted at a later date (i.e. the actual survey).  The pre-design step also includes assistance in designing a non-market valuation study that would allow NMFS to use the derived WTP estimates in some benefit-cost type of analysis.  After the pre-design phase is complete, feasibility of the study assessed, and the scope of the long-term project is developed, NMFS will determine whether the additional research will be implemented.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling
1-800-333-0505.  A copy of the solicitation will be attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file on or about May 25, 2004.  A hard copy of the solicitation will only be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Offers received by July 2, 2004 will be considered for award.  Numbered Note 1 applies.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice advising potential offerers that the Government is considering dissolving the Total HUBZone set-aside for solicitation HSFLR040014 and making the solicitation a small business set-aside.  This would improve teaming arrangements between parties because FAR 52.219-3 has percentage requirements for the cost of personnel that may be difficult for HUBZone contractors to accomplish at a reasonable price. This is because Eddy county and Chaves county New Mexico are no longer HUBZone counties and the Artesia FLETC is isolated from metropolitan areas. Interested small businesses are encouraged to review solicitation HSFLR040014 and amendments thereto.  The Government intends to make a determination during the week of 17 May 2004 regarding dissolving the HUBZone set-aside and making the acquisition a small business set-aside.  If this occurs, solicitation HSFLR040014 will be extended 30 days from 13 May 2004 and an additional mandatory site visit will be scheduled so that all additional interested parties can attend.  Please note that interested parties that attended the prior two site visits will not be required to attend the third site visit, if one is scheduled.  This pre-solicitation notice advises potential offerers that the Government has a posted solicitation for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction contract under solicitation HSFLR040014 with a one year base period and four additional one year options. The guaranteed minimum amount of the potential contract is $100,000.00 per year, which will be satisfied by issuing one or more delivery orders during each year of the contract. The maximum estimated value is $10,000,000.00 over the life of the contract; $2,000,000.00 for the base and $2,000,000.00 for each of the following four option years. This procurement is currently a 100% HUBZone small business set-aside which may be converted to a small business set-aside.  The North American Identification Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts. The successful offeror will be competitively chosen using negotiated procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. The contract will be for a broad range of alteration, repair, and construction work on real property at the FLETC campus in Artesia NM. The successful contractor must provide all necessary management, quality control, labor, materials, and equipment required to facilitate the renovation and repairs to facilities at the FLETC campuses. The work issued under individual delivery orders shall include tasks in a variety of trades, including but not limited to, carpentry, pavement repair, roofing, excavation, interior/exterior electrical, steam fitting, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, concrete masonry, welding, and other general construction requirements. The contractor must have the capability to provide management and quality control for all subcontractor and supplier requirements for each delivery order. The contractor may have several delivery orders involving subcontractors, suppliers and his/her own work forces to manage concurrently. The successful offeror must have experience in IDIQ Construction, Job Order Contracts, Work Order Contracts and/or relevant experience in the management of numerous multiple skill projects simultaneously. If you have any questions, send an EMAIL to art.welton@dhs.gov or send them to: FLETC, 1300 W. Richey Ave, Attn: Art Welton, Procurement, Bldg 25, Artesia, NM 88210.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), intends on issuing on a sole-source basis, a purchase order for services to Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The goal of this contractual effort is to review the current position-based control strategy of the Pendulation Control System (PCS) and suggest other control strategies such as velocity-based. This effort supports on-going Sealift research and development (R&D) efforts to develop systems which stabilize payloads being maneuvered about ships at sea and help the crane operators perform functions more effectively. A key investigator at VA Tech developed the existing pendulation control motion algorithms for the Hagglunds TC3637 crane as part of an Advanced Technology Demonstration for Shipboard Crane Motion Compensation systems from 2000 until 2003. He was responsible for the analytical control and numerical simul ation development, control software coding, as well as modeling of the various sensor systems. This effort required extensive data collection onboard the ship as well as many hours of analyzing the data. As such, he is uniquely familiar with the control solution currently implemented on the SS Flickertail State PCS unit. Because of this experience the requested key performer is uniquely qualified to perform this tasking because of his intimate knowledge of the mathematical algorithms used to develop the position-based control strategy. This new effort to investigate new control strategies requires the knowledge and experience developed during the previous research. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for com petitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may e-mail their capability statements to harrisonhl@nswccd.navy.mil. (See note #22)

<DESC>The Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Washington University in St. Louis, MO., for a project titled “Collaborative MDMA and other Club Drugs Study.”  Washington University has an existing professional collaborations and facility infractures in place to undertake this project by nature of performing unique on-going clinical studies in Taiwan on abuse dependence and adverse sequelae relevant to MDMA and methamphetamine use.  Successful project completion relies on use of the established collaborations with the Taiwanese government and Taiwan national agencies, such as the National Bureau of Controlled Substances (NBCS) and the National Defense Medical Center’s Tri-Service General Hospital.  It also has a proven track record and expertise in the nature and extent of self-reported dependence on and abuse of 4 specific types of club drugs (i.e. Ecstasy, GHB, rohypnol and ketamine compared to methamphetamine).  The Washington University will conduct qualitative research on club drug use in the genetically homogenous Taiwan area, as part of a continuing epidemiological study, including measurements about the harmful, neurological, and psychiatric effects of drug use.  Washington University will use its expertise in clinical interviewing and the establishment and maintenance of area focal groups to obtain and compare self-reported club drug use information of study participants with club drug use as obtained by chemical urine analysis.  Washington University will perform interviewing and focal group services in Taiwan, in addition to establishing a domestically located data collection center.  We plan to award a 2-year, cost reimbursement type contract.  Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.320-1, Only One Responsible Source.  Inherent duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in providing the required services make competition unfeasible.  Organization believing they successfully can challenge the Government’s sole source justification should send relevant and specific information in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  1) Understanding the project including the ability of the Offeror to manage the modified Risk Behavior Assessment (RBA) and to conduct qualitative research on the unique factors that relate to club drug use in an effort to interpret epidemiological data.  2) Technical approach and ability, including experience and expertise in providing collected ethnographic data as it related to Taiwanese club drug use.  3) Management plan, facilities and corporate experience in managing projects of similar size, scope and content.  Experience in providing similar collaborative support will be analyzed.  4) Personnel and the ability of the Offeror’s staff to provide the needed ethnographic data. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

CPD requires a contractor to design and carry out the various aspects of short-term and long-term information sharing and Technical Assistance (TA) projects through a variety of media, including computer networks, electronic bulletin boards, publications, brochures, conferences, videos, training films, distance learning, fax, automatic fax/voice mail systems, publications, and public information projects, as well as other innovative and traditional methods of dissemination.

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs is interested in the procurement of Storage Area Network and Network Attached Storage Equipment in Order to Support the National Consolidation of Data and Migration to One Centrally Managed Network Operating System That Supports Data Replication to Ensure Continuity of Operations. Indian Affairs (IA) has identified the need to expand existing Storage Area Network (SAN) capabilities that are presently being utilized to store data for the IRMS system.  The IRMS system is the primary application used to track trust monetary ownership.  This system has recently been upgraded from an older UNISYS NX Series to new UNISYS CS7201 systems utilizing EMC Symetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) technology to replicate data on the system to a duplicate system in the Indian Affairs Disaster Recovery Site in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  A consolidated network migrated to one network operating system would allow for the implementation of a unified directory service that would increase internal communication, security, and provide the ability to backup all data to a single location that would allow for effective continuity of operations and disaster recovery. Indian Affairs (IA), Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Information Architecture and Engineering (OIAE) is responsible for provision of a unified directory service that is in compliance with Indian Affairs Enterprise Architecture (EA) and  which provides the agency the ability to effectively collaborate internally, within the Department of the Interior, and with the Public.  In an effort to simplify operations, reduce data entry, improve data accuracy and security, and to reduce the complexity facing computer users, best practices stipulate that directory enabled applications and Directory Services within a modern network operating systems be designed and deployed. Indian Affairs has recently upgraded Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity by migrating to a Very High Performance Network Backbone System (VBNS+), and utilizes TCP/IP v.6 as the only protocol within the VBNS+.  The upgrade of the existing UNISYS and SAN solution to include more SAN capacity to provide storage capacity for newer ORACLE database systems and to provide for consolidated file storage of all Indian Affairs data by adding Network Attached Storage (NAS) in one centrally managed storage system will provide for proper retention of all IA data as well continuity of operations in any disaster scenario as mandated by federal laws and regulations pertaining to maintaining the security and integrity of federal and Indian trust data.

<DESC>The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt a national standard identifier for health care providers for use in the health care industry.  CMS adopted the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the standard identifier in the final rule. The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) is the computer system that would be used to uniquely identify health care providers, assign them NPIs, update their information, and disseminate data to the industry. The Enumerator will carry out a number of functions, including, but not limited to, entering identifying information about a health care provider into the NPPES for those providers applying via paper application; notifying such a provider of its NPI; and assisting providers with questions or problems, including those providers applying for NPIs via the internet.  The NPPES will edit the data, checking for consistency, formatting addresses, and validating Social Security Numbers.  The NPPES will also search the database to determine whether the health care provider already has an NPI.  As a result, CMS hereby issues a draft SOW and request for information seeking industry comment concerning the NPI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  

This solicitation, W914NS-04-Q-0175, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This action is unrestricted and provides for full and open competition.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13 and DFARS Change Notice 20020531.  The associated NAICS code is 336999.  The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Baghdad, Iraq has a requirement for three (3) Truck Mounted Flash-Butt Welders and two (2) 160-Ton Rail Pullers.  Contract Line Items (CLIN) 0001 and 0002 must be delivered FOB to the Baghdad Central Station, Iraq (grid zone coordinates:  MB 42252 87280).   

Description and specification requirements are:  
CLIN 0001 - Truck Mounted Flash-Butt Welders; QTY:  3 EA.; Unit Price: $____________; Extended Price: $__________________.  
CLIN 0002 – 160-Ton Rail Puller; QTY: 2 EA.; Unit Price: $_____________; Extended Price: $__________________.  TOTAL ALL CLINs: $____________________.  

Statement of Work (SOW):  See Attachment 1.

Past Performance:  

Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001, Quantity 3 Each & CLIN 0002; Quantity: 2 Each; 120 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001; Quantity:  3 Each; CLIN 0002; Quantity: 2 Each; 180 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: __________; Quantity: _______; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a best value basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW), past performance, and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than past performance and price.  Past performance and price are of equal importance.  The Government intends to make a single award for all items.  The price proposals are not rated against standards but will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness.  

It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will meet or exceed the requirements affordably.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Contracting Officer reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the best value selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  Professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the March 11, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the commercial items identified below, prepared in  accordance with the format  in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number: 4011265150-00023, is issued as a Request for Quotation  (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22(B). The U.S. Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland intends to procure the following four lined items as a sole source procurement under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) where there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's needs can be satisfied by one responsible source and no other instrument will satisfy U.S. Department of Agriculture's requirement. U.S. Department of Agriculture  intends to procure the following instrument: (LINED ITEM 1): "Portable Fourier Transform ("FTIR") Mid-Infrared Spectrometer", Part Number:0400-0000,Manufactured by "Surface Optics Corporation",- who are located at 11555 Rancho Bernardo Road in San Diego, California – and they can be reached at phone number 858-675-7404. The above instrument shall be used to compliment existing laboratory instruments by allowing the scanning  in the mid-infrared of samples on site without the need to necessarily remove the sample from it's environment ("In-Situ").  The above instrument shall also be able to compliment the existing instruments available from the "Remote  Sensing and Hydrology Laboratory" at U.S. Department of Agriculture–which can perform the same function for the near-infrared spectral range.  The beam of the above instrument comes out from the front and any sample can be placed in front of it, which is what U.S. Department of Agriculture's minimum requirements are, and most "FTIR" instruments that are portable-require the sample to be placed in a specific cell for scanning, and this is what U.S. Department of Agriculture's existing laboratory instruments are; However:U.S. Department of Agriculture requires the above instrument  "without this limitation" – in order to perform "In-situ" work-to scan the ground as it is without the need to take a sample from the ground and place it in a sample holder.  The above instrument shall allow for scanning large samples by moving the sample under the spectrometer, such as "large samples of manure" on a rotating platter. The following are the MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS for the above instrument:  Shall be capable of scanning the mid-infrared from 4000 to 400 wave-numbers at a resolution of 4 wave-numbers or better (lower values are better);  Shall be a "Fourier Transform Spectrometer" - required to produce data complimentary to that produced by existing U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory "FTIR" instrumentation  presently owned by U.S. Department of Agriculture;  Shall be capable of scanning samples in diffuse reflectance mode with no limitation on the size of sample which can be scanned: e.g. –The instrument shall be able to be positioned  in such a way that any surface can be scanned in place by either  moving the instrument over the sample or moving the sample under the instrument beam, e.g.–no specific sample holder shall be required or limitation in getting a sample under the spectral beam;  The instrument shall be capable in any position, e.g. instrument can be placed upside down, sideways, in order to scan a sample surface; Instrument shall be capable of operating in a "portable" mode under battery power. (LINED ITEM 2): Diffuse Reflectance Head, Part Number: 0400-0013.(LINED ITEM 3): Part Number: 0400-5005,  "Software" that shall operate the SOC 400 reflectometer.(LINED ITEM 4) Installation and Training  for the above instrument.

Question - Is the Air Force looking for a firm/team to provide all disciplines under this contract or can a firm/team submit for a specific portion of work only? Answer – Interested firms should be able to provide, either through in-house capability or through partnering arrangements with other firms, all services described in the synopsis.  This typically includes architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, and electrical and fire protection.

Question – Who are the incumbent contractors associated with the current A&E services contract? Answer – current firms that provide services are:

Gillies, Stransky, Brems and Smith Architects 
of Salt Lake City Utah (Large Business)

Design West of Logan Utah  (Large Business)

URS of Salt Lake City Utah  (Large Business)

EASE Incorporated of Salt Lake City Utah (Small Disadvantaged Business)

Thomas Engineering Company of Bountiful Utah (Small Woman Owned Business)

James O Chamberlin and Associates of Ogden Utah (Small Business)

Question – Will the incumbent contractors be proposing to become contractors under this new contract? Answer – The Air Force is unable to project which firms will decide to submit synopsis response packages in conjunction with this particular opportunity, this is a decision each potential offeror will make. While it is possible that a given firms status may have changed relative to their respective small business categorization with the SBA; as long as they are determined to be responsive/responsible contractors as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulations and comply with overall synopsis requirements; the Air Force will not exclude incumbents from competing.

Question – Why is PKOE the Contracting Section at Hill AFB responsible for processing this synopsis and associated contracting activity? Answer -  PKOE is the Construction and Environmental section of Operational Contracting Division within the overall Contracting Directorate at Hill AFB. A&E contracting is the responsibility of the PKOE section. However, the Selection Boards evaluating, and rating submittals will be comprised solely of licensed professional architects and engineers within Civil Engineering.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice advising potential offerers that the Government is considering dissolving the Total HUBZone set-aside and making the solicitation a small business set-aside.  This would improve teaming arrangements between parties because FAR 52.219-3 has percentage requirements for the cost of personnel that may be difficult for HUBZone contractors to accomplish at a reasonable price. This is because Eddy county and Chaves county New Mexico are no longer HUBZone counties. A site visit is mandatory and all parties that have attended the prior two site visits are requested to provide information to our office that they can meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-3 without significantly impacting their proposed coefficients.  These vendors should provide documentation by faxing it to 505-748-8002.  This information should show how the company can meet this FAR requirement and include the percentage impact to their coefficient. This information shall be protected as source selection information.  This information should be faxed no later than 12:00pm MT on 18 May 2004.  If it is determined that two or more HUBZone contractors can not meet this requirement at a reasonable price, the Total HUBZone set-aside will be dissolved and the solicitation will be amended to be a small business set-aside.  All small business are encouraged to review this solicitation because it may be open to all small businesses.The successful offeror will be competitively chosen using negotiated procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. The contract will be for a broad range of alteration, repair, and construction work on real property at the FLETC campus in Artesia NM. The successful contractor must provide all necessary management, quality control, labor, materials, and equipment required to facilitate the renovation and repairs to facilities at the FLETC campuses.

The devices shall be self-sufficient, environmentally friendly, safe, and easily set up, maintained and operated, to provide continuous training for ashore and afloat activities to ensure readiness in response to aircraft crash rescue and firefighting.  This requirement is safety critical.   The MAFTD requirement will be procured on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to award a single requirements contract with Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) unit pricing anticipating a multiple contract period of five years.

A fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC), for Air Quality Compliance at various locations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana is anticipated. 
The objective of this solicitation is to provide environmental engineering services and incidental architect-engineering services to various Navy and Marine Corps facilities, and other government facilities within the contract geographic area, to meet statutory compliance requirements for all applicable environmental laws and regulations with regard to air quality. Additionally, the contract may provide air compliance support to CERCLA, RCRA, and Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) projects. The work to be ordered under this contract will be performed at various locations within Southwest Division's footprint. Work may be located in CA, AZ, NV, NW, AK, WA, OR, ID, UT AND MT as deemed necessary to meet workload requirements. The majority of the work will be performed in CA. The exact location of work will be designated in the individual contract task orders. 
The proposed Task Order 0001 requirement entails developing, submitting, and implementing a Class I Air Operating Permit for U.S. Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, in accordance with Title V of the Clean Air Act and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) State Implementation Plan (SIP) Provision R9-3-527.C. Applicable requirements are codified in the following articles of the Arizona Administrative Code, Title 18, Chapter 2: Article 3 (Permits and Permit Revisions), Article 6 (Emissions from Existing and New Non-point Sources), Article 7 (Existing Stationary Source Performance Standards), Article 8 (Emissions from Mobile Sources [New and Existing], Article 9 (New Source Performance Standards), and Article 11 (Federal Hazardous Air Pollutants). Developing this Permit will require a comprehensive air emission source inventory to calculate the combined and total impacts of all current and potential emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from aircraft, support equipment, ordnance, other mobile and fixed internal combustion engines, painting and solvent operations. Ozone depleting substance-containing refrigeration equipment and impacts from fugitive dusts (PM-10) will also be evaluated and quantified. The Class I Air Operations Permit application will require an exhaustive compilation of air emission calculations and actual stack/source emissions data, and assemblage of the draft and final permit for submission to ADEQ. The Options for the proposed task order 0001 provide ongoing Permit compliance support for the installation Environmental Department as described in this Scope, including modifications of the Permit to reflect changes to the MCAS Yuma mission. The duration of work under the task order shall not exceed 540 calendar days under the Basic and an additional 365 days under the Options. Services shall be provided in accordance with the current Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Guide for A-E firms performing services for SOUTHWESTNAVFACENGCOM. All references identified in the basic contract remain in full effect. 
The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than the offeror(s) submitting the lowest total price(s); and to award contract(s) to the offeror(s) determined to be the most advantageous to the government. Award(s) may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received. The contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee for each contract awarded is $5,000. The aggregate value of task orders issued under the contracts combined shall not exceed $15,000,000. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, offerors should submit proposals containing their most favorable terms. 
Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures. Contracts will be awarded to the responsible firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each. However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s). The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s). The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards. Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factors 1 – Specialized Experience, 2 – Past Performance, and 3 – Engineering and Management Approach which are of equal importance to each other. Factor 4 – Price is slightly less important than any one of the other factors. When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3, when combined are significantly more important than Factor 4. The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government. Proposals shall be submitted in format as specified in solicitation Clause L-4, Proposal submission requirements. 
A pre-proposal conference will be held in conjunction with the site visit for the proposed Task Order 0001. Offerors are encouraged to participate in the conference/site visit. The date and time of the pre-proposal conference and site visit have not yet been determined.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to lower the estimated dollar amount to $1,000,000.00 for any one period for a maximum estimated contract value of $3,000,000, to clarify and answer questions. Work will issued by firm fixed price task orders. The clo sing date remains the same. Question: The acronym ACA in the Contracting Office Address stands for? Answer: Army Contracting Agency. Question: Multiple times throughout the Synopsis text  there is a reference to See Note 24, where do we find this list of notes? Answer: Go to the bottom of the text of the announcement on the Fed Biz Ops website. Click on Government-wide numbered notes. Question: Selection Criteria G requests Extent of participation of SB........measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort and I did receive the Modification that the 60% of subcontracts does not apply to the 8(a) set-aside. We are the 8(a) archit ectural/engineering prime and while we will have other Small Business consultants that will be detailed in our submittal, until scope of work is determined for specific projects it is unclear how to measure that participation as a percentage.   Answer: The percentage of small businesses will not be used as an evaluation criteria in selecting the most technically qualified firm. However, those percentages will be used in negotiation of the contract itself after the most technically qualified vendo r has been selected.   Question: We are currently working on our proposal and team members for the above mentioned solicitation.  As we went through it our Cost Estimate team member asked if Pulsar/RS Means based automated software is truly the one you want addressed.  This appe ars to be an older system and we just wanted to make sure it is indeed the system you wanted addressed in the proposal. Answer: Yes.  Question: How hard a requirement is it that estimates be submitted using R.S. Means based PULSAR format? Answer: This is a requirement. Government computers are currently set up to meet this requirement.   Question: Is there an incumbent who is doing this work for Ft. Carson and Schriever AFB?  If so, please identify.   Answer: Holmes and Narvar has a current IDIQ A/E contract at Ft. Carson.  Question: Other than the size standard of $4M, what employee size standard to you envision would be required to perform the work defined in the April 26, 2004 Synopsis?    Answer: It is up to each individual contractor to determine how many employees he or she should have on hand to meet the requirement.

<CONTACT>STACEY DIAMOND CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487309     sdiamond@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS), Department of the Interior (DOI) distribution facility in Lakewood, Colorado currently disseminates USGS and other Federal agency scientific information products (maps, books, reports, and other products).  Orders are currently taken by walk-in, phone, and through the World Wide Web.  These products are disseminated in hardcopy, CD-ROM, DVD, and print-on-demand formats through a network of authorized USGS Business Partners as well as through walk-up and mail delivery mechanisms.  These products constitute a substantial volume of items, currently more than 89,000 titles. During fiscal year (FY) 2004, the USGS will implement a phased transition from a hardcopy to an on-demand format for all topographic and some thematic map products in combination with a focus on softcopy online offerings from an electronic publications warehouse with hardcopy formats being produced by the private sector or others.  By the end of FY 2005, USGS product distribution and warehouse functions in Lakewood will be downsized. Some products other than topographic maps will continue to be offered in hardcopy and optical media formats by the USGS. The USGS is interested in identifying organizations capable of warehousing and delivering USGS and other Federal agency hardcopy maps, books, reports and other related scientific information products that are in the public domain.  Descriptions of methods of delivery to meet customer needs are being solicited from other organizations, public or private. The USGS is interested in identifying new strategies, technologies, and approaches for delivering products from digital files to print-on-demand and or lithographic printing provided by the private sector.  Most products would start from digital files.  The USGS is also interested in determining if there is public- or private-sector interest in the hardcopy distribution function as the USGS migrates to an emphasis on the aforementioned electronic warehouse distribution system.  To understand the breadth of opportunities, the USGS is issuing this RFI.  Please limit responses to 10 pages and note that responses can include information pertaining to all product lines or to specific product lines.   1) The USGS is seeking options for the dissemination of USGS and other Federal agency hardcopy maps, books, reports, and other related scientific information products currently managed by the USGS and options for managing this inventory.  These products constitute a substantial volume of items.  Please provide an inventory and delivery strategy?  The USGS desires to greatly downsize or perhaps eliminate this hardcopy scientific information product inventory and warehouse operation, as currently maintained by the USGS.  As a first step to replace this system-while maintaining the high level of service the USGS customer base expects-the USGS seeks to determine whether an interested organization, public or private, is capable of assisting in the downsizing of its current inventory and warehouse operation and in shifting this activity from the Federal government to the private sector.  Please explain your strategies and ability to accomplish these tasks.    2)  The USGS serves a wide range of customers, including its own employees; its partners, both those who participate in the production of USGS products and those who currently retail USGS and other Federal agency hardcopy scientific information products; other Federal agencies; members of Congress and their staffs; State and local governments; academia; industry; the general public; and foreign customers.  With this diversity of customers, it is challenging to provide services that meet their various needs.  How would you suggest organizing services and grouping customers to best serve them?  The USGS will continue to announce availability of new products and information through a variety of mechanisms (i.e. press releases, conference and tradeshows, information bulletins).   3) USGS scientific information products are intellectual property produced by the USGS and must be recognized as such.  The USGS visual identity must be maintained with the intellectual property.  Explain how your organization will ensure that the USGS receives credit for its scientific work.  How would you ensure that USGS identity or "branding" is maintained throughout the access and distribution process?   4) Current prices for USGS products are developed to recover the costs associated with reproduction and distribution based on law and Executive guidance.  For our paper map products, the USGS develops and implements prices with approval from the Secretary of the Interior while the Government Printing Office establishes prices for text products.  Explain your pricing structure?   5)  Two important roles of the current USGS warehousing and distribution system are to provide USGS and other Federal agency scientific information products in times of emergency and to meet internal USGS scientific activity needs.  How will your organization handle these emergency and internal product delivery needs?   6) The USGS is seeking providers who will furnish any or all distribution and warehouse services currently handled by the USGS.  The USGS will also consider proposals that include multiple distribution channels, selected product line offerings, and warehousing scenarios within the public or private sector.   7) An important assumption upon which to base your response is that the USGS will not compete with the provider by offering the same services provided through this RFI.  However, the USGS will continue to provide free digital versions of information products through our Web pages.  Information from you based on this assumption is requested.   8) How does your organization envision your relationship with the USGS (contract, totally divest to the private sector, other)?   9) Given the public domain nature of USGS scientific information products, what is your organization's interest in these services?  Would you like to suggest any terms or conditions that your organization would consider reasonable and necessary for committing to such services for the USGS?   10) As the USGS moves toward a greater emphasis on free of charge softcopy delivery methods for some scientific information products, those products may no longer be restricted to a "standard" format.  For example, there may not be a standard USGS topographic product.  Instead of revising the mass-produced hardcopy USGS topographic maps, the USGS will focus on digital revisions within The National Map (the USGS online interactive map service).  What impacts will this shift in delivery methods and the desire of the USGS to divest our current warehousing and distribution activities to the private sector have on your organization? A pre-RFI Response Conference will be held on June 2, 2004 at 10 a.m. EDST at Building 810, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, Colorado.  See http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/public/html/about.html for directions and all attendees must RSVP to the email address below by June 1, 2004 at 10 a.m EDST. The purpose of this conference is to allow potential service providers to meet with USGS representatives and to ask questions.  Final proposals are due by 4 p.m. EDST July 2, 2004.  This is not a procurement action.  This RFI is a no-cost voluntary request.  Industry organizations participating in this effort will do so at their own expense.  This announcement does not obligate the United States Department of the Interior or any other Government organization to reimburse any participant expenses.  No telephone inquiries will be entertained. This announcement is only for the purpose if identifying available sources.  Any questions should be submitted to inventoryRFI@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) through the Defense Logistics Agency’s DSS Acquisition Staff Directorate located at Fort Belvoir, VA is looking for possible sources to fulfill an anticipated requirement for replacement of servers for Agency-wide implementation.  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY and in no way implies an award by the Government.  We are seeking INFORMATION ONLY.  

DCAA is contemplating the possible replacement of servers Agency-wide throughout the continental United States.  These servers will upgrade/replace current system hardware that is no longer under warranty and has become technically obsolete.  The requirement potentially involves the purchase of up to one hundred fifteen (115) file/print servers; thirty-seven (37) rack mounted 1U servers to replace domain controllers, web servers, DNS, SMTP MRTG, RPM and the APPS COOP servers; and two (2) rack mounted 6U or 7U servers to replace the current Cisco Works HQ back-up server and the Memphis back-up servers.  

TRADE-IN INFORMATION:

In order to meet this potential requirement and defray costs, DCAA wishes to “trade-in” (as credit to be applied toward the purchase of the new servers) some of its existing servers that have become technically obsolete. The following will apply to the trade-in of these older servers:

(a)  All trade-in equipment will need to be packaged and picked up at a number of locations throughout the United States. 

(b) The trade-in equipment will consist of the following:

	130 each	Dell PowerEdge 4300 Servers*
	    4 each  	Dell 2300 Servers**
	    8 each	Dell 6300 Servers***
	    2 each	Dell 4400 Servers****

*Minimum spec on these servers:  550MHz, 256MB RAM, 3x36 GB HD, 35/70 GB DLT7000 TBU.
**Minimum spec on these servers:  350 MHz, 256MB RAM, 2x 9.1 GB HD
***Minimum spec on these servers:  4x400 MHz, 2 GB RAM, 2 x 9 and 3 x18 GB hard drives.
****Minimum spec on these servers:  2 x 1 GHz, 512MB RAM, 3x36 GB HD, 20/40 GB TBU.

(c)  DCAA personnel will sanitize all hard drives prior to trade-in.  A completed “Certification of Hard Drive Disposition” form will accompany each server. 

(d)  DCAA personnel will complete a “Certification of Computer Configuration/ Equipment for Exchange” form for each server traded.  This form will indicate the exact specification of each server; it will all certify that the server is in good working order.

(e)  Any costs associated with the trade-in of these servers (i.e., shipping/ handling fees, processing fees, etc) will be deducted from the “trade-in credit” received.  The Government would not award a separate contract to cover these costs.  

NEW EQUPMENT INFORMATION:

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT   
 

This is a Sources Sought Notice only.    This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources.    The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is performing a market survey to determine if there are an adequate number of interested and qualified firms, having the capability to provide up-front financing for the design, construction and operation of a 59 MGD (million gallons per day) secondary wastewater treatment plant with supporting facilities.    Construction of the wastewater treatment plant will take place in Tijuana, Mexico.    

We are seeking interested firms that have the ability to provide up-front financing and serve as the contract administrators for this project, which has an estimated cost of between $300 and $600 million.    The firm will only provide up-front financing for this project but is not the responsible party for the design, construction and operations of the project.    The design, construction and operation of the project will be contracted in accordance with competitive bid requirements as prescribed under Mexican law.    Design and construction of the project is expected to take 18 to 24 months.    The USIBWC will request funding for this effort through the U.S. Federal Budget Process and will be diligent in working with members of Congress and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on an annual basis; however, in the event that funding is not appropriated the USIBWC is not required to make any payment.    In order to successfully enter into a contract with an interested firm, the firm must agree to enter into such contract at its own risk; the contract will also include a provision specifying that no cancellation/ termination fee will be paid.    The firm will be the owner of the facility for the term of the contract or until all fees are fully paid, whichever is sooner.    The contract is expected to be an operating lease or a fee for services contract.   The USIBWC is expected to initiate payments to the firm two years after construction has been completed; payments are contingent upon receiving funding appropriations from Congress on an annual basis.  

All interested firms must notify this office in writing by mail or fax by May 28, 2004.  Responses shall include:

  
(1)	Identification and verification of the firm’s capabilities to provide up-front financing for an estimated project cost between $300 and $600 million.

(2)	Annual financial report for the last five years. 

(3)	Letter from a financial institution confirming the firm’s capability of obtaining up-front financing.  

This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.    All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond.    Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.    The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis.  

Send responses to the U. S. International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 N. Mesa, Suite C-100, El Paso, Texas 79902-1441, ATTN:  Alicia Williams or fax to (915) 832-4192 by COB, 5:00pm (MST).

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) is considering whether or not to set aside a requirement for Small Business Concerns only.  The anticipated requirement is for the procurement of Direct Supply Natural Gas (DSNG) (NSN: 6830-01-318-5797) for the Defense Supply Center in Richmond, VA.  The effort reflects an estimated annual requirement of 107,470 Dekatherms (Dths) via firm or firm equivalent transportation with a twelve (12) month delivery period commencing 01 October 2004.  Supply management and billing services are required for this effort.  The NAICS Code is 211111, and the size standard is 500 employees.  Please be advised that if a small business was to receive an award as a prime contractor as a result of a small business set-aside, the small business must furnish direct supply natural gas from a well owned and operated by a small business producer(s), which is defined by the Small Business Administration to include all affiliates and subsidiaries.  Note, intermediaries and middlemen, such as other suppliers and marketers, regardless of size, would not be allowed.

<DESC>The Library of Congress FEDLINK Program requires accounting services to pay invoices for federal libraries who borrow from libraries that charge for lending materials.  Federal libraries that use this Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Payment Service will be participating in the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) FEDLINK cooperative program and will establish accounts with LC/FEDLINK to pay for the charges they incur. The ILL Payment Service vendor will pay the lending libraries' certified invoices and will then bill the borrowing library's LC/FEDLINK account for reimbursement for the amount paid to the lender and for a service fee.  The vendor will provide the borrowing library with detailed reports and summaries of lender invoices paid.  This service is designed for payments, not collections.  That is, the vendor is to pay institutions that photocopy or lend materials from their collection to federal libraries; the vendor is not to collect from borrowers (individuals or institutions) fees that federal libraries themselves may charge when they photocopy or lend materials. The FEDLINK ILL fee payment service provides an efficient method for federal libraries to pay ILL fees that may be charged by lending institutions to cover the cost of photocopying or other interlibrary loan processing costs.  WRITTEN RESPONSES SHOULD INCLUDE PRICES AND TECHNICAL DATA SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE CAPABILITY. Response shall be provided via email or fax to Vanessa Fox at vfox@loc.gov or 202-707-0485.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding the development of the acquisition strategy and request for proposal for the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) Enterprise Services acquisition.  The purpose of the acquis ition is to consolidate functions now performed under multiple existing contracts, provide the most efficient management construct, and provide continuous system improvements in support of the AKO enterprise.  The AKO will be transformed into a best-in-cla ss enterprise infostructure operated and maintained by a single vendor.   AKO BACKGROUND:  AKO was started as a pilot project in 1997 and was so successful that the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff, Army mandated that all data, information and systems be moved behind this portal.  The AKO architecture and portal represen t the first step in building the Army intranet that operates within the DoD Global Information Grid Enterprise Service (GIGES) construct and provides Army personnel with access to business related and mission-oriented knowledge in real time.  Through AKO-E nterprise Services, disparate and redundant implementations are being transformed into an enterprise infostructure that will ultimately be operated and maintained by a single organization.  At present, there are two AKO sites, a Primary site and a Secondar y site, both connected to the  unclassified but sensitive Internet protocol router (NIPRNet) and secret internet protocol router (SIPRNet) networks. The Army Office of the Chief Information Officer/G6 is conducting full and open competition to enter into a systems integration contract to operate and maintain AKO as the Enterprise portal that provides universal, secure access for the Army world-wide.  T he end state vision for AKO is Ã¢Â€ÂœOne Army Web presence providing global secure access to accurate, relevant, and authoritative information at anytime, from anywhere to ensure mission success.Ã¢Â€Â   AKO and AKO-Secure (AKO-S) will be the single point of entry into the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Intranets for both the business side and the deployed soldiers to achieve reachback to the sustaining base for essential mission,  and critical support processes, especially for forces in remote geographic areas such as Bosnia , Afghanistan, and Iraq.   ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL:  An on-line reading room has been established at http://128.190.157.111/akolsi.nsf/main.  The user name is:  AKOLSI.  The Password is:  Customer123.  The password is case sensitive.  The reading room currently contains the fo llowing documents (information only):   - SOWs for the current AKO contracts - AKO CPD (Capabilities Production Document) - DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the upcoming acquisition - AKO Vision ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:   SCOPE:  AKO, the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s enterprise information portal, consists of both a Primary and Secondary site. The successful offeror  may  have complete program management responsibility at both the Primary and Secondary sites or may have shared responsibilit y between the Primary and Secondary sites with the existing Secondary site contractor.  This AKO-Enterprise Services procurement will consolidate four active, independent contracts in support of the AKO effort.  The scope includes systems operation and mai ntenance, network and systems engineering support, hardware and software integration, software development and maintenance, application development and maintenance, Army-wide help desk support, and senior level technology and program management support ser vices.  Services must be provided, without disruption, on a continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year basis.   The successful offeror  will  provide the necessary infrastructure and tools to the Active, National Guard, and Reserve soldiers and th eir families; Department of the Army Civilians; and applicable contractors. (Reference: Reading room Statement o f Work documents for more detail) ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:  The objective of this procurement is to obtain a solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a standard Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support Army military and civilian employees in meeting AKOÃ¢Â€Â™s mission.  As such, the primary objectives of this acquisition are to: 1.	Receive a solution that produces a seamless/transparent transition from existing contracts to this contract, enhances performance goals, as well as process standards and procedures. 2.	Under a performance-based arrangement, award to a contractor committed to delivering a highly reliable, user friendly, timely, and secure IT solution that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations. 3.	Establish a partner-focused working relationship with AKO to provide the highest quality, consistent management approach and support of all AKO operations. 4.	Receive a solution that provides robust and user-friendly Enterprise Commercial-Off-The-Shelf toolsets capability to integrate best of breed in collaboration suites, content management, search/data retrieval, and taxonomy. 5.	Assure AKO services are provided to any connected AKO user anywhere at any time Ã¢Â€Â“ even in a network-challenged environment. 6.	Assure ubiquitous access is provided to DoD and Army-wide Web-based business applications behind AKO. 7.	Obtain security compliance/information assurance for AKO, its data, and users. 8.	Obtain security architecture that is scalable to the Army. 9.	Obtain the single entry point into the Army network allowing common access, security, authentication, and presentation solution (common look and feel) for all Army network services.   10.	Ensure AKO Primary and Secondary sites remain operationally effective and without disruption  during hardware and software changes and upgrades. 11.	Develop robust testing capability to minimize adverse impacts to operations from changes and upgrades. ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT:  The successful offeror will play a significant role in creating the most efficient AKO enterprise.  The Government will  consider both  new and existing system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to provid e a continuous high quality service to AKO users.  A successful vendor must be able to operate the AKO enterprise as soon as possible after contract award, finish implementing the ongoing system upgrades already in progress, and then transition to a leader ship role in the technical, managerial and organizational evolution of the AKO enterprise without disruption to current AKO services and capabilities.  AKO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:  The AKO Enterprise Services contractor will have significant responsibility for the continued development of AKO functionality.  The Government seeks help in identifying AKO user needs, back-end business application needs, and ov erall functional enhancements.  The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of AKO improvements. CONTRACT OPTION:  The current AKO and AKO-S systems infostructure consists of contractor-owned components located at a primary site, Ft. Belvoir, Virginia and a secondary site at an unnamed remote location.  The primary and secondary sites are exact images  of each other, each sharing the AKO user load.  The Government currently has a contractor in place  providing the primary and secondary site platforms, associated systems software and operations as a managed service.   In the near-term, it may not be cost effective for the Government to end its contractual relationship with the current contractor  for the disaster recovery  services.  These services represent roughly 2/3 of the total funding expended for the current AKO Enterprise Services.  The Government is considering including this work as an option for execution when it can be proven that a new implementation fo r the disaster recovery services  is more cost effective than the current approach.	 The remaining AKO enterprise systems are operating on Government-owned platforms at the Ft. Belvoir, Virginia location. PERFORMANCE-BASED:  Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Statement of Objectives approach for defining the requirements.   TERM:  The contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with four one-year options to extend the term. QUESTIONS:  The Government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP. 1.	Is it feasible to include a contract option for consolidating the services currently provided by another contractor ?  2.	Is a managed service approach feasible or should the government provide all the hardware/software? 3.	What specific detail or additional information  is needed in order to bid on this entire requirement? 4.	How would you recommend handling software licenses issues?  5.	What contractual incentives or disincentives would motivate outstanding performance?  In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized? 6.	What type of contract would be most beneficial to both the government and the contractor? 7.	How long would it take to  transition  from the existing contracts to the new contract? 8.	What logical portions of work are suitable for small business participation on an effort of this size? 9.	What portal and data/content management best practices are used by industry? 10.	How does industry leverage portals to ensure effective support to multi-functional elements of the organization, and what lessons learned can they share? 11.	What are the industry standards for portal maintenance? What are the cost drivers unique to portal maintenance? SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages, and supported by a Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides.  Submit responses , via e-mail, to Jo hn Norway at  John.Norway@itec4.army.mil not later than 28 May 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP)
<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a market survey to determine potential sources for the SFFP. The United States Air Force, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) is seeking a qualified contractor for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 with options for FY 06 through FY 09.   In 1979, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) initiated the Summer Faculty Research Program (SFRP) to introduce research faculty into Air Force laboratory facilities across the US.  The intent of the program has been to bolster research efforts and build critical links between Air Force scientists and their counterparts in the academic community.  The original SFRP was concluded in 1999 and a new program, the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program replaced it.  Under the SFFP, US college, university, or technical institute faculty members (known as SFFP fellows) perform mentor-based research in areas of interest to the Air Force in Air Force research facilities. The objectives of the program are to: 
1)Provide the fellows high-quality, meaningful, mentor-based research at Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
2) Provide the fellows opportunities to stimulate professional relationships among the scientists and engineers in AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
3)Enhance the research interests and capabilities of faculty in the US academic community
4)Elevate the awareness of the US academic community of Air Force research needs 
During the summer, the fellows, under the mentorship of AF researchers, will conduct research at Air Force research facilities for a period of eight (8) to twelve (12) weeks.  AFOSR intends to award between forty (40) to one hundred (100) awards per year with awards restricted to university faculty members with PhDs in science, mathematics, or engineering and who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Prospective offeror must have the following technical capabilities:  
•Ability  to advertise and select outstanding researchers who hold doctoral degrees, including providing an on-line web-site method of applying for the SFFP
•Ability to establish an applicant review (evaluation) process and assemble review panels of experts to evaluate candidates’ applications (Panel experts shall be authorities in their field with previous research experience related to the areas of interest to the Air Force). 
• Ability to establish and maintain a database of AFRL research mentors for SFFP fellows, and a database of research interests for Air Force research facilities to provide high-quality research opportunities in these technical areas
•Ability to establish and maintain a financial management system for electronically issuing fellows stipends and tracking costs.
•Have an established reputation in science and engineering fellowship management.

<SUBJECT>R -- Training & Technical Assistance for Teens Linked to Care; A Group Level Intervention for HIV-Positive Youth
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is contemplating the award of a contract on a Sole Source basis to the University of California –Los Angeles Neuropsychiatric Institute,  in accordance with FAR part 6.302-1(b).  The basis for this contemplation is that only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  The requirement is as follows:  

The CDC has endorsed Teens Linked to Care (TLC) as the only effective intervention for HIV-positive adolescents in the scientific literature of the past 22 years. TLC was included as the only intervention that addresses the prevention needs of HIV-positive youth for which Community Based Organizations (CBOs) directly funded by the CDC could apply in Program Announcement (PA) 04064. TLC was featured in the main text of PA 04064 and as an attachment to PA 04064 because it was the only intervention for HIV-positive adolescents in the scientific literature.  Applicants were informed that agencies chosen for funding would receive intervention materials, training, and ongoing technical assistance related to the projects for which they were funded.

The TLC intervention, a group-level intervention has been adapted and tailored by behavioral scientists at the Center for Community Health (CCH) to be delivered as an individual-level intervention.  This intervention, called Choosing Life: Empowerment, Action, Results (CLEAR) is the only manual-driven individual-level intervention for YLWH that is science-based.  Thus, in this sole-source contract, CDC will be procuring TLC, a group-level intervention for HIV-positive adolescents and CLEAR, an individual-level intervention for HIV-positive adolescents.  These will target effectively two programmatic objectives of PA04064.  

The University of California – Los Angeles (UCLA), Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI) Center for Community Health (CCH) designed and conducted the original field research on TLC from 1991 to 1996.

The purpose of this contract is to procure the services and technical expertise from the only qualified contractor who will partner with the CDC to provide training and technical assistance on TLC  to directly-funded CBOs who are awarded funds to implement this intervention through Program Announcement 04064 and to adapt the CLEAR intervention to a PCM model so that agencies funded for PCM under PA 04064 will have a structured, evidence-based approach to use in their programs. 

The TLC intervention materials are copyrighted by the University of California - Los Angeles. These proprietary materials comprise the TLC intervention kits to be further refined and provided by CCH to be used by CBOs funded to implement the TLC intervention.  Therefore CDC believes that CCH is the only resource that has this unique program.

The anticipated performance period is from June 15, 2004 through September 30, 2005.  It is believed that University of California possesses the capability and is uniquely qualifed to perform this requirement as stated above.  All responsible sources that feel they should be considered qualified to provide the foregoing services may submit a response by 3:00pm EST, June 10, 2004 by e-mail to Lisa Lombard at LPL0@CDC.GOV (LPL ZERO).  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>B -- Laboratory Analysis - Organics analyses for Alaska Cruise Ship Industry
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water seeks to procure , on an other than  full and open competition, organics analytical support services for a single sampling episode, relative to the disposal of pollutants  for EPA’s Alaska Cruise Ship Industry effluent guidelines study .  The limited sources are  Pacific Analytical, Inc., 6056 Corte del Cedro, Carlsbad, CA 92009;  Ecology and Environment, Inc., 4493 Walden Ave, Lancaster, NY 14086  and Battelle, Duxbury Operations, 397 Washington Street, Duxbury, MA 02332.
 
These are the only laboratories currently with the demonstrated capability and experience in analyzing samples by the required methods (and associated method modifications that are specified in the SOW) and reporting data electronically in accordance with the EPA-specified format.  EPA requires four different types of analysis on influent and effluent  samples, 1) Method 624 - Volatiles  of approximately 46 total samples; 2) Method 625 - Semivolatiles of approximately 47 total samples;  3) Method 624 - Dilution/Reanalysis,  no more than 15 samples; 4) Method 625 Dilution/Reanalysis no more than  15 samples.  EPA will use the analytical data provided under this purchase order to develop industrial effluent discharge regulations that govern the disposal of pollutants from the Alaska Cruise Ship Industry and to develop and revise analytical methods for characterizing such pollutant discharges; therefore, data produced under this purchase order must be of the highest possible quality.  Laboratories will be required to employ a comprehensive quality assurance program, meet facilities and equipment requirements, and provide personnel that demonstrate technical expertise in analytical chemistry techniques.  The sampling episode for the Alaska Cruise Ship Industry, Episode 6503, is scheduled to be collected during the week of June  20, 2004.  It is anticipated that samples will arrive at the laboratory each day from Tuesday, June 22, 2004 through Saturday, June 26, 2004.  The laboratory is required to meet a 45-day data turnaround from receipt of the last sample associated with Episode 6503 at the laboratory.  If dilutions and/or reanalyses are required, the data turnaround time for the entire data package will remain at 45 days.  The laboratory must adhere to extraction and analytical holding times as stated in the methods.

Laboratories must have at least four years of  experience analyzing for organics parameters using the required EPA methods, and has Method Detection Limit (MDL) and Initial Precision and Recovery (IPR) data on-file at EPA.  QC must be performed pertinent to the Analytical Requirements Summary 2248.   Start-up tests requiring significant time and effort would be required from other labs.  Mass spectra and retention times for each pollutant (there are over 100 pollutants) and internal standard must be created and stored in a user-created library.  Analytical conditions of the instrument must be adjusted so that undistorted spectra are produced.  Significant  time and effort must be invested  in developing the necessary data delivery software to submit data electronically in the format required by EPA.  The process of new laboratory start up would also involve a significant expenditure of EPA resources (at least 80 hours) to bring the laboratories up to speed.  This expenditure is not justified by a one-time purchase order for these services and this cost to EPA would more than counter any potential analysis cost savings that another laboratory could offer.  In addition, EPA requires these services within  four  weeks’ time.  This time would be insufficient to bring any other laboratories “up to speed” and ensure that EPA would receive the high quality data needed in the format required to support effluent guidelines regulatory development for the Alaska Cruise Ship Industry.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and other than full and open competition in accordance with (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)) and FAR 6.302-1.  This is a notice of intent only and request for competitive proposals will only be solicited from the sources cited above.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting detailed documentation which establishes that their technical qualifications meet the EPA’s requirement.  This information should be sent  to Linda Merryman at the office identified above, by fax (513) 487-2115 or by e-mail (merryman.linda@epa.gov) .  Anticipated award date is June 14, 2004, therefore documentation must be received by May 25, 2004.   A determination by the EPA to limit responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<SUBJECT>B -- Physician Practice Expense (PE) Data
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to contract on a sole source basis with the American Medical Association for the further development of SMS survey data to assist the Center for Medicare Management.  CMS is using the exception to full and open competition described in FAR 6.302-1 to procure this information.
Section 121 of the Social Security Amendments of 1994 (Pub.L.103-432) required the Secretary to implement a system of resource-based practice expense relative value units (PERVUs) for all physicians' services, beginning in 1998.  Section 4505 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)(Pub.L.105-33) made a number of changes to the system for determining PERVUs, including delay of initian implementation until 1999 and provision for a four-year transition.
CMS adopted methodology for computing resource-based preactice expense RVUs utilized significant sources of actual practice expense data that were available; the Clinical Practice Expert Panel (CPEP) data and the AMA's SMS data.  The AMA's SMS collected information on aggregate practice expenses from a random national survy of approximately 4,000 physicians who spend the greatest proposrtion of their time in patient care activities.  The survey includes AMA members and non-AMA member physicians and office and hospital-based physicians.
CMS initially used practice expenses data by specialty, derived from the 1995 through 1997 SMS survey data, to create six cost pools: administrative labor, clinical labor, medical supplies, medical equipment, office suplies, and all other expenses.  The AMA's SMS survey of actual cost data was used to determine practice expense per hour by cost category.  CMS subsequently updated the data by incorporating SMS data from 1998 and 1999.  The AMA discontinued the SMS survey due to its cost and CMS is unable to further update the data.
In order to receive new data necessary for the practice expense methodology, CMS plans to offset some of the AMA's survey cost by purchasing the necessary data from the AMA and to include modifications to the survey that include additional questions specific to CMS' requirements.
The proposed contract type is a firm-fixed price.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition citing the authority provided by FAR 6.302-1 will be prepared and approved.  Interested parties must submit complete cost and technical informaiton by the response date established above.  Email or fax responses are not acceptable.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Informaiton received will be reviewed solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22. Direct questions to Georgette Vlangas at (410) 786-8372.

Basis of award: a. This acquisition follows the policies and procedures in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 208.404-70. b. The basis for award is as follows: (1) A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror’s technical information shall be made. A proposal is technically acceptable if it meets all of the requirements of Factor 1, Technical Qualifications. Only those Offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. (2) Offerors whose technical proposals are determined unacceptable by the Government will be notified promptly of the basis of the determination. (3) All technically acceptable Offerors will receive a Performance Confidence Assessment rating in accordance with the six ratings in Factor 3, Past Performance. (4) The Government will perform a price evaluation as described in this letter RFP. (5) An award will be made to the lowest priced offer if they have a “High Confidence” past performance assessment. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror has a past performance assessment of “Significant Confidence” or less. (6) Finally, the Government will make the award based on a tradeoff between price and past performance among Offerors first determined to be technically acceptable. Although price will be considered a significant factor, past performance will be considered more important than price. Evaluation factors The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Qualifications Factor 2: Price Factor 3: Past Performance TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS (Factor 1): a. The Offerors’ technical qualifications must be determined to be acceptable prior to proceeding to the integrated assessment of price and past performance. An Offeror whose proposal is rated technically unacceptable will not be considered for award and will not be evaluated further. The ratings for technical qualifications are: “acceptable,” “reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable,” and “not acceptable.” b. The following are definitions for the technical qualification ratings that will be assigned to each Offeror’s proposal: RATING DEFINITION ACCEPTABLE -- Proposal meets all of the requirements of the Technical Qualification Sub-factors and Elements. REASONABLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING MADE ACCEPTABLE -- Proposal does not meet all of the requirements of the Technical Qualification Sub-factors and Elements; however, there is potential for correction after clarifications or discussions. NOT ACCEPTABLE -- Proposal does not meet all of the requirements of the Technical Qualification Sub-factors and Elements. c. All of the following must be met for a proposal to be considered technically acceptable: 1. The offeror must have an effective staffing plan to ensure continuity throughout the period of performance in supporting the needs of PHSD, as described in the attached SOW. 2. The offeror must have an effective management approach that: (a) Manages administrative support as required in the SOW; (b) Identifies and mitigates management issues in a timely, accurate fashion and in sufficient detail to make informed proactive and corrective decisions; (c) Proactively manages cost, schedule, and performance of service and deliverables in accordance with sound business practices, including clear visibility into cost, schedule, and performance for both contractor and Government management; (d) Effectively communicates problems to the Government in a timely manner; (e) Provides clear and concise management communication between prime and subcontractors. 3. The offeror must have a clear understanding or a plan for providing the knowledge required of the following: (a) Air Force Medical and Surgeon General policy and procedures directly related to the preventive health program and the ASIMS program or representative military medical health policy and procedures; (b) The interrelation of the various AF medical data systems (Air Force (AF) Personnel Data, PHSD Data Import/Export Program, Air Force Corporate Health Information Processing Service (AFCHIPS) central data processing, AF Complete Immunization Tracking Application (AFCITA), Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical Readiness (PHA/PIMR), Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS) and AF to DEERS Immunization Interface) utilized by PHSD. ) Utilized in the ASIMS program or similar medical health tracking data systems as in the areas of clinical immunization records, individual readiness for deployment and occupational medical exam; and (c) The ability to work with Medical Training Facilities in configuration of ASIMS modules and training users of the systems. 4. The offeror must have personnel that have the minimum experience requirements as defined in SOW, paragraph 1.6.30. The Government reserves the right to add any and all key personnel provided to resulting contract for this acquisition. PRICE (Factor 2) a. Offeror’s Ceiling Price will be evaluated to determine that it is fair and reasonable. An unreasonably low proposed Ceiling Price may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unreasonable proposal. b. The Offeror’s proposal must represent a price that is (a) fair under current market conditions, (b) reasonable to the seller, and (c) reasonable to the buyer. PAST PERFORMANCE (Factor 3): a. Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an Offeror’s relevant present and past work record to assess the Government’s confidence in the Offeror’s ability to successfully perform as proposed. b. The following are definitions for assigning the relevancy to the Offeror’s past and present contracts: RATING DEFINITION HIGHLY RELEVANT The magnitude of the effort and the complexities on this contract are essentially what the solicitation requires. RELEVANT Some dissimilarities in magnitude of the effort and/or complexities exist on this contract, but it contains most of what the solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Much less or dissimilar magnitude of effort and/or complexities exist on this contract, but it contains some of what the solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT Performance on this contract contains relatively no similarities to the performance required by the solicitation. c. Where relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a “Unknown Confidence” rating for the Past Performance factor. More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. Past Performance information may be obtained through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), similar systems of other Government departments and agencies, questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) channels, interviews with program managers and contracting officers, and other sources known to the Government, including commercial sources. Offerors are to note that, in conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the Offeror and data obtained from other sources. Each Offeror will receive one of the ratings described below: RATING DEFINITION HIGH CONFIDENCE -- Based on the Offeror’s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. SIGNIFICANT CONFIDENCE -- Based on the Offeror’s performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. CONFIDENCE -- Based on the Offeror’s performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE -- No performance record identifiable. LITTLE CONFIDENCE -- Based on the Offeror’s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. NO CONFIDENCE -- Based on the Offeror’s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract or order without discussions with Offerors Therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. 10.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>Questions and Answers
1. Will you want to have IMAG for this event, or would you like on the SVHS and GFX to the screens?
No, just a standard DVD.

1(a)  To confirm....you do not want to see what the camera's shoot on the screens?  You only want the camera feeds to go to record?
Yes, you are correct.
 
2. Do you need DVD menu's programmed?
No
 
3. In your SOW, in section 8.5, you state that the room size is 46'X75' with 20' ceilings for the Empire Room.  However, when I looked up the dimensions on-line I noted that the hotel has the dimensions at 50'X111' with 11'7" ceilings.  Are you only using part of the room or should I refer to the hotels specs?

My error, please use the dimensions from the on-line hotel specifications.
 
4. How are you seating attendees for this event?
Rows of chairs facing stage divided with a center aisle.
 
5. In section 8.5 you have requested PCM microphones to be "aimed toward the pit".  Please define "pit".
Pit is defined as the location where recording equipment is set up (previous year contractor located it behind stage drape)
 
6. I am assuming that we will run the presentations for the presenter, is this correct?
No, each team will provide a person to advance slides during team's presentation.
 
7. Will you need any special packaging for the give away DVD's?
Each DVD should be marked with "Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award Presentation", date, team number, and the name of the team making the presentation enclosed in a DVD jewel case.
 
8. In section 8.5 you request "2 additional lights need for Q&A session".  Will there be a specific place that all questions will be addressed from or will attendees be able to ask questions from anywhere in the room?
Upon completion of the teams' presentation the entire team will come down off the stage and line up in front of the judge panel for the 10 minute question and answer session.

8(a)  For the Q&A would you like the judges and audience's questions to be on the recorded DVD or just the presenters?
Yes; however, the audience does not ask questions, just the judges and only the team members respond. 

9. Would you like to have the Q&A session recorded to DVD?
Each recorded session should include:
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) introducing team
Presentation (15 minutes)
Question & Answer Session (10 minutes)
Presentation of Coins by Judges to Team Members (approximately 5 minutes)
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) concluding the session
 
10. Do you have a specific location for the screens or is that up to us?
Two screens, side by side with approximately 12 inch space between, located directly behind the stage centered between the two podiums.

10(a). Do you want the same image to be on both screens?
This depends on the presenters.  In the past we have had teams that used one screen to show a PowerPoint slide presentation while a video ran on the other screen.
I would say; however, the majority of the teams present the same image on both screens.
 
11)  In Equipment 8.2, you refer to the number of people required to setup, operate and teardown equipment each day.  Under Security though, 8.6, you reference the Presentation room being locked each day.  Will the equipment have to be torn down and reset each day?  
No, you will not need to tear down the equipment each day.
 
12) Do you have a 24-hour hold on the room(s) with the Omni Shoreham?
Yes, we have a 24 hour hold on the room.
 
13) In section 3.4, you reference the presentation loads going on the computers. In order to determine staffing levels for the 5:30pm - 10:00pm timeframe, does all equipment need to be operated at that time, or just the computers and their displays. Please advise.
     Just the computers and their displays should be operated to ensure the presentations load        properly for display on the screens.
 
14) Will only graphics and VHS video be sent to screens? Will there be times that different images will be on each screen, i.e.-  graphics on one screen, while, VHS or camera on the other? Do we simply need to accommodate any mix of the above? Please advise.
This depends on the presenters.  In the past we have had teams that used one screen to show a PowerPoint slide presentation while a video ran on the other screen.  I would say; however, the majority of the teams present the same image on both screens.
 
15) Do you want the computer presentations switched to the DVD Record devices or is it only the cameras and the VHS playback? Please advise.
We want the presentations recorded on DVD, this includes:
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) introducing team
Presentation (15 minutes)
Question & Answer Session (10 minutes)
Presentation of Coins by Judges to Team Members (approximately 5 minutes)
Master of Ceremonies (30-60 seconds) concluding the session

<DESC>This amendment is issued to make the following changes in Solicitation W91247-04-B-0003 for Temporary Lodging for Reservists at Fort Bragg, North Carolina for the period 1 Jun 04 through 30 Sep 04: 1.  The hour and date specified for receipt of bids is not extended. 2.  The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s response to questions submitted by potential bidders follows:      a. QUESTION:  Did the government contact all hotels within the 12-mile radius with this solicitation?  With the large number of rooms required, I would assume so but wanted to double check.          ANSWER:  The solicitation for lodging was published on the FedBizOps website, and the Fort Bragg Contracting website for anyone interested.      b.  QUESTION:  Do the hotels have to be FEMA approved?           ANSWER:  No.      c.  QUESTION:  Do the apartments have to be FEMA approved?           ANSWER:  No.      d.  QUESTION:  If the number of rooms needed cannot be secured within the 12-mile radius, will the government continue outward?           ANSWER:  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to satisfy the requirement within the 12-mile radius.  If the requirement cannot be met within that radius, a new solicitation would be required for the overflow.      e.  QUESTION:   Once a bidder receives an award and provides accommodations according to the SOW, will the occupants stay in the room(s) for a continuous period, i.e., for the entire first base period of 122 days?          ANSWER:  There is no guarantee of a specific number of days or rooms in a resulting contract.   The Government guarantees only one room for one day during the contract period, as specified in the solicitation.        f.  QUESTION:  Will there be changes in occupants during this period?           ANSWER:  The length of stay for any given Reservist or unit is not known.       g.  QUESTION:   Will the room be occupied consecutively, with no vacant days?           ANSWER:  See response to f. above.      h.  QUESTION:   In regards to single and double occupancy; we understand that a single bedroom apartment may house (2) individuals with two beds in the bedroom; a two-bedroom apartment may house (4) individuals with two beds in a bedroom.  Is this cor rect (?) and if so, may we house (6) individuals in a three bedroom apartment with (2) individuals per bedroom?          ANSWER: Yes.       i. QUESTION:  If a full-size washer and dryer and an extra set of towels is provided in an apartment with unlimited usage by the occupants residing in that apartment, will a clean towel exchange of three times per week still be provided?           ANSWER: Yes.      j. QUESTION:   If weekly cleaning service is performed in each apartment, will the daily removal of trash still be required or will a weekly removal suffice?         ANSWER:  Daily removal of trash as required by the Statement of Work shall be provided by the lodging facility, not the Reservists.      k. QUESTION:  How often will the reservists be exchanged within a particular room?  I realize that you may not be able to answer the specifics of this question so you may be as vague as weekly, monthly, at the option periods, etc.          ANSWER: Quantities are estimated only.  Because we sometimes do not receive notice of the ReservistsÃ¢Â€Â™ arrival or departure until shortly before they are to arrive or depart Fort Bragg, we cannot provide that information.  We are not requiring  the lodging facility to guarantee rooms.  Please read FAR 52.216-21 and FAR 52.216-18.      l.  QUESTION:  In your bid you request daily trash removal service.  Is having a common trash receptacle on property that the reservists can utilize sufficient to meet this stated need?          ANSWER:  See response to j. above. 3.  All other factors remain the same.
