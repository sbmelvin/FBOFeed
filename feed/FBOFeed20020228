This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number F05611-02-Q-1001, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-03.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) number is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The proposed acquisition is reserved for small businesses.  Women owned and disabled veteran owned small businesses are encouraged to submit quotes.  Conduct Study on Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse diet and possible metals contamination exposure at landfills. 
Scope of Work:  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has expressed concern that metals (particularly arsenic, iron, and manganese) contained in seepage water at Landfill Sites 6 and 7 on the U.S. Air Force Academy may present a possible ecological risk to the resident population of the federally threaten Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse (PMJM).  To assess possible metal uptake pathways and the degree of exposure, the USFWS has recommended field studies of soil, water, and dietary items that PMJM may come in contact with at the seepage areas.  An Assessment of PMJM persistence and the quality of the habitat in the vicinity of the seeps was also recommended.  This Scope of Work focuses on assessing the exposure risk by analyzing metals concentration in known PMJM dietary items and the tissues of surrogate small mammals found in PMJM habitats.  Non-destructive sampling of the PMJM populations and habitat around the seep areas will also be conducted.  
Specifications:  
(1)  Using PMJM specimens previously collected on the Academy, conduct an analysis of the stomach contents of up to 25 individuals to determine the diet composition of the PMJM foraging on the base.  Frozen PMJM specimens are presently stored at the Academy's Natural Resource's office.
(2)  Based on the results of the PMJM diet analysis, collect a statistically adequate number of samples of the diet items near the seeps at landfill sites 6 and 7.  Collect a statistically adequate number of control samples in areas unaffected by the seeps.  Samples shall be collected during the active season of the PMJM.    
(3)  Conduct a chemical analysis of the forage samples to determine the concentration of metals (particularly arsenic, selenium, iron, and manganese) in the PMJM diet items.
(4)  Harvest an adequate sample of other small mammal species (e.g. deer mouse, meadow voles, and western harvest mouse) around the seeps and control areas.  Conduct the same diet composition analysis as performed on the PMJM specimens.
(5)  Based on the results of the small mammal diet analysis (Item 4), collect a statistically adequate number of samples of their dietary items near the seeps at landfill sites 6 and 7.  Collect a statistically adequate number of control samples in areas unaffected by the seeps.  
(6)  Conduct a chemical analysis of the small mammal dietary items and organs (kidney, liver) to determine the concentration of metals (particularly arsenic, selenium, iron, and manganese) in the diet and tissues.
(7)  Live-trap areas above, below, and around the landfill seeps in June-September 2002 to document the persistence of a PMJM population.  Collect information on body weight, sex, estimated age, (young, sub-adult, adult), reproductive conditions, and any visual abnormalities for all trapped specimens.  Permanently mark all PMJM trapped with a uniquely coded Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag.  The habitat around the seeps shall also be qualitatively compared with the other known PMJM areas on the base.
(8)  Prepare a final report summarizing the finding of the diet and tissue analysis studies, population persistence monitoring, and habitat assessment.  Based on these findings, the report shall include professional judgments concerning the metals exposure risk to the PMJM population.  LINE ITEM 0001: Contractor shall conduct a study on Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse diet and possible metals contamination exposure at landfills  $__________.

(4)  The Government shall conduct Past Performance Surveys.   BASIS OF AWARD:  Subject to the provisions herein, award will be made to a single offeror based on the best overall value to the Government considering the evaluation factors stated below.  No proposal will be accepted that does not contain the total amount of work specified in the solicitation.  To be considered for an award, a proposal shall conform to all terms and conditions contained in the solicitation. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of resources or procedures or unrealistic in cost, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.  It should be carefully noted that award might be made without discussions; offerors are encouraged to submit their "Best Value" proposals with their original submission. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is in the public interest; make award to other than lowest cost offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
EVALUATION FACTORS:  a.  In selecting the offer most advantageous to the government, the following factors and assigned weights will be considered:
(1) Technical (30%)  Technical evaluation will be a combination of Government's pre-award site visit and contractors written proposal  (2) Past Performance (70%) b. The Government is interested in proposals which offer the best value in relevant previous experience (past performance) in meeting the requirements of the statement of work and its' attachments; providing quality technical performance at a fair and reasonable cost.  Technical & cost are of approximately equal value. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR:  Past Performance will be evaluated utilizing ratings of: exceptional, very good, satisfactory, marginal and unsatisfactory.  The following elements will be evaluated: quality of service, maintenance of vehicles, schedule compliance, cost controls, business relations and relevant prior experience. PAST PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT: a. Assessment of the offeror's past performance is the major evaluation criterion evaluating the credibility of the offeror's proposal and relative capability to meet performance requirements.  Information utilized will be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, past performance ratings received by mail from references submitted by contractor and from other customers known to the government; others who may have useful and relevant information may be contacted. Information will also be considered regarding any significant subcontractors, and key personnel records.  b.  Evaluation of past performance will include a determination of the offeror's commitment to customer satisfaction.  c.  Award may be made from the initial offers without discussions.  However, if discussions are held offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.  If an offeror, or the proposed employees for the offeror, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will be given a neutral rating.  The Government will exercise discretion in the determination of whether past performance information furnished is or is not considered as relevant to the present requirement. In all cases of offerors from whom there is no information collected or otherwise furnished on past performance history, the neutral rating assigned may effectively view the offeror as an unknown performance risk. As an unknown performance risk, evaluators shall rate the offeror neither favorably nor unfavorably on the factor of past performance. However, competitors are advised that use of this neutral rating approach for offerors with no past performance history may properly cause the offeror to be considered less favorably than another with a favorable and relevant performance history.  In any Best Value acquisition, it may be appropriate, to award to a higher cost offeror with a good performance record over a lower-cost, 'neutral rated' offeror with no relevant past performance history.  SUBCONTRACTING:  If contractor intends to subcontract part of this requirement, subcontractor is required to meet the same qualifications specified in Statement of Work and the past performance submission stated for the prime contractor.  Subcontractor submissions must be submitted along with prime contractor's proposal at the time of proposal due date.  Failure to submit required information will constitute a rejection of any subcontractor. CONTRACT CLAUSE:  Offerors shall include a COMPLETED COPY OF THE PROVISION AT FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS with their proposal.  The best way to complete this certification is to download the far clauses (Volume II) at http://www.arnet.gov/far print out the FAR Clause 52.212.3 & Alt I.

<CONTACT>JANE M. CARLSON, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, FAX 703-787-1009
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.    This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  The  Department of the Interior, Minerals Management  Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a  contract to provide a thorough and objective review  of the state-of-the-art of the methodology and  models utilized in assessing fair-market value (FMV)  for oil and gas properties. The MMS has the  responsibilities for leasing submerged federal lands  and ensuring environmentally safe oil and gas  production operations.  Under the Outer Continental  Shelf Lease Act (OCSLA), the MMS is empowered with  assuring that the American public receives FMV for  the offshore oil and gas properties.  MMS’s current  tract evaluation procedure, which utilizes  Discounted Cash Flow Analysis and MONTE CARLO  sampling of development scenarios, is designed to  assure that the Government receives fair value for  the tracts leased.  Internal and external reviews of  the auction and evaluation procedures used conclude  that they are effective in achieving this goal.  However, since the mid- 1990s, offshore Exploration  and Production (E&P) practices and technology have  changed substantially. On the OCS Shelf, the average  size of new field discoveries has become smaller,  and production decline rates have accelerated, thus  increasing both cost per unit and risk. At the same  time, success rates have improved substantially,  reducing exploration costs and risks.  The MMS, in  its effort to evaluate the adequacy of its model  (computer program) in capturing the evolving  engineering and economic changes in the oil and gas  field in determining FMV, wants to evaluate the  existing practices of FMV determination of oil and  gas properties in the industry. The project will  involve four tasks: 1) The contractor will develop a  basic understanding of the MMS assessment  methodology through meetings and discussions with  MMS scientists and engineers involved in FMV  assessment. 2) Develop questionnaire to be used in  the industry interviews for the determination of  current industry practices for the FMV determination  for oil and gas properties. 3) Conduct interviews  with the industry (no more than 10) personnel  directly involved with the FMV determination, and 4)  Analyze the results of the interviews and provide  detailed report on the industry practices for the  FMV for offshore oil and gas properties highlighting  differences and similarities with the existing MMS  methodology and model.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to  compete for this contract, interested parties MUST  demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the  work by providing, by 4:00 P.M., EST, March 15,  2002, a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your  key personnel (those who would have primary  responsibility for performing and/or managing the  study) with their qualifications and specific  experience and your organizational experience and  facilities with: (A) oil and gas operations on the  United States Outer Continental Shelf;  (B)  benchmarking industry practices both on a field  basis and an investment basis;  (2) past performance  including specific references (including contract  number & project description, period of performance,  dollar amount, client identification with the point  of contact & telephone number) for previous work of  this nature that your key personnel or organization  has performed within the last four years. REFERENCES  WILL BE CHECKED. Offerors shall submit their  Capabilities Statement in original and six copies  and one electronic copy in MS Word on a floppy disk  to, Minerals Management Service, 381Elden Street,  Procurement Operations Branch, MS-2500, Herndon,  Virginia 20170-4817.  Attention: Terry W. Carroll.  Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based  on; (1) key personnel skills, abilities and  experience; your organization's experience and (2)  past performance (including number, size, and  complexity of similar projects, adherence to  schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program  management, willingness to cooperate when  difficulties arise, general compliance with the  terms of the contracts, and acceptability of  delivered products. Following review of all  Capability Statements, we will establish a list of  those deemed most qualified to perform the work.  Qualified Offerors will be notified and provided  additional proposal instructions. Those proposals  will essentially consist of a written technical  proposal, program management plan and separate  cost/business proposal. Further details of those  proposal requirements and logistical considerations  will be provided to qualified Offerors at a later  date. The period of performance of the contract will  be from date of award through July 31, 2002. The  cost range is $80,000 to $90,000. Questions should  be faxed as soon as possible to:  Terry W.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Feeding tubes are typically used for hospitalized patients to deliver liquid nutrition to the stomach.  These tubes can be introduced either through the nose and throat, or directly through the skin and into the stomach.  Feeding tubes used in both avenues of entry have demonstrated problems with clogging.  When the tubes become clogged they must be removed causing significant discomfort to the patient and an additional health care cost.  This technology describes a method for modifying the internal surface of feeding tubes to reduce clogging.  More specifically, this involves treating or coating the internal surface of the tube with a hydrophilic functional group which reduces the adsorption of proteins to the tube.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

The NIMH proposed to award a one year contract with five - one year options.  Some aspects of the Statement of Work  (SOW) will be reimbursed on a fixed unit price basis while other aspects of the (SOW) will be reimbursed on a cost basis.  With the elucidation of the complete draft sequence of the human and other mammalian genomes, the next challenge is to conduct large-scale functional analyses of these genomes to greatly enhance our understanding of neurobiology.  The laboratory mouse plays a pivotal role in human functional genomic, insofar as mouse strains carrying mutations have provided useful models for human diseases.  RFA MH-99-007, "Mouse Mutagenesis and Phenotyping: Nervous System and Behavior" was issued in 1999 to establish neuroscience-focused facilities for large-scale, efficient, whole-genome mutagenesis, in order to promote the systematic and comprehensive functional analysis of neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes in the mouse.  Cooperative Agreements for three large-scale mutagenesis and phenotyping facilities that focus on abnormalities in nervous system function and behavior were funded under the RFA.  A major goal of this initiative is to provide the scientific community with new research resources, i.e., mutant animals in a timely fashion.  The expected production of mutants generated by the three neuroscience-focused mutagenesis facilities exceeds the capacity of existing mouse storage and distribution facilities.  In order to realize the full potential for the scientific community of mutants produced in the three mutagenesis facilities, the NIMH is seeking to establish a large-scale phenotyping and distribution "virtual" center.  The virtual center shall be comprised of a network of investigators with expertise in different phenotypic domains, database/bioinformatics experts who can construct a state-of-the-art database in response to the needs of the neuroscience and behavioral communities and adequate capacity to maintain and distribute mutant strains.  The specific functions to be performed by this virtual center include:  (1) confirmatory phenotyping of various nervous system functions and complex behaviors in mutant mice received from the three mutagenesis facilities; (2) maintenance of mutant strains as live animals, and cryopreserved materials (embryos or ovaries and sperm); (3) wide distribution to the scientific community of mutant strains in a very timely fashion; and (4) development and curation of a public database of neuroscience-relevant phenotypic information from mutant strains.  In addition to the above, the contract shall also contain an option for the performance of additional services.  The additional services that could be required include the baseline phenotyping of nine inbred strains (129/SvlmJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, BTBR, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CAST/Ei, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ) on neuroscience-relevant domains, mapping of mutations to a higher resolution than originally done by the three mutagenesis facilities, and  breeding of mutations into balanced and congenic stocks on specified genetic backgrounds for distribution to the scientific community.  To eliminate the potential for patents on mutant mice and cryopreserved materials that would undermine the development of a widely available national resource the successful offeror must agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed by the employment of  FAR Clauses 52.227-11, "Patent Rights (Deviation)" and 52.227-14, "Rights in Data-General (Deviation)".  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIMH-01-DN-0018 will be available on or about June 19, 2001, and receipt of proposals will be due on or about November 9, 2001.  The RFP may be accessed electronically through the NIMH Homepage at http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ .  First click on Funding Opportunities, then click on Contracts and scroll down to the RFP Number.  This RFP may also be accessed electronically at FEDBIZOPPS at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ .  Please note that the RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Reporting Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria and the Proposal Preparation Instructions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package.  Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors included in the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

Dear Sir or Madam:

In an effort to increase internal awareness of web design/multimedia contracting options throughout the Smithsonian Institution (SI), the Institution plans to host a Small Business Web Development/Multimedia Vendor Information Fair (the "Fair"), accessible to SI staff and other possible venues in the Washington, D.C. museum and arts community.  We expect to have approximately 250-300 Webmasters, Multimedia and Information Technology Professionals, Curators, and other Technical and Program personnel participate in the Fair.  As currently projected, the Fair will be held as follows:

Date:	April 30, 2002
Place:   Smithsonian Institution Ripley Center (the Quadrangle)
1100 Jefferson Drive, S.W., Washington, D.C.  20560

The Fair will target the following:

Approximately 50-75 small, disadvantaged, women-owned, HUB Zone, and/or Veteran-owned businesses specializing in web design and multimedia services that have not done business with SI for the past two years.

In addition, small businesses that have worked with any SI museum, gallery, or other programmatic unit in the past two years are encouraged to submit capabilities information about their firms, indicating projects completed during the last six months, for the purpose of providing information to participants at the Fair.   Representatives may be allowed to publicize their individual firms at the fair depending on the space available.

SI reserves the right to employ a panel of webmasters to select vendors for the Fair.  All participants and the criteria for selection will be at the sole discretion of, and will be announced by, the Smithsonian.  Participants will be permitted to cite their Fair selection, in conjunction with selection criteria, on their vendor resumes.  In addition, selected vendors may be given a special opportunity to make a 15-minute presentation in the Marion & Gustave Ring Auditorium.

SI will identify and group participating vendors by category.  To be considered for any of the categories in the left-hand column below, vendors must provide no less than three (3) examples (URLs, electronic portfolio examples, etc.) of independent work created in each given category during the last 12-month period.  Although each category asks that vendors identify no less than three samples for consideration, the same sample may be used as an example of work that meets the criteria for more than one category.  A web-design project, for instance, may involve database programming and a flash-animation interactive qualifying in several categories.  The right-hand column below indicates categories of small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  Please indicate whether your firm can be designated in any of the following categories:

 
Web/Multimedia Category:
-	Web Design ? plumbing /back-end programming/CMS
-	Web Design ? GUI/Front-end design
-	Multi-media/CD/DVD Kiosk (Stand Alone)
-	Animation
-	Audio/video production
-	Streaming media/Audio-video download
-	E-commerce engines

Small Business Category:
-	Small business
-	Small disadvantaged business
-	Minority-owned business
-	Woman-owned business
-	Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone 
-	Veteran-owned business
-	Service disabled veteran-owned small business
 
All information obtained for the Fair will become the property of the Smithsonian Institution.  It will serve as a resource base for web development and multimedia-based projects that may be implemented as funding becomes available

Firms interested in being considered for participation in the Fair should respond to Rudy D. Watley, Supplier Diversity Program Manager (watleyr@si.edu) or Bruce A. Falk, Contract Negotiator/Attorney (FalkB@si.edu) by March 20, 2002.  SI reserves the right not to consider late submissions.  SI will make selections on a rolling basis on or before April 5, 2002, and will follow up on participation logistics with all selected firms.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW ANNEX AND
MODERNIZATION OF THE POST OFFICE/COURTHOUSE-LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, Request for Proposal (RFP)  No. GS-07P-02-UTC-0008. This notice announces the solicitation requirement for construction of the new annex and modernization of the Post Office/Courthouse, Little Rock, Arkansas.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for construction excellence in public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project. Contractors shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head. This letter shall include a statement of interest, DUNS number, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference (maximum of 2) and a copy of a valid business license.  Letters are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than March 29, 2002.  Send letters to the attention of Pamela Lackey, Contract Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Eastern Area, (7PEP), Room 12A, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102.
This is an occupied phased construction project.  The annex of the courthouse will consist of approximately 165,000 GSF which includes indoor parking (approximately 24,000 GSF).  The modernization of the existing facility includes work in most areas (approximately 224,000 GSF).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $56,000,000 to $61,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about March 25, 2002.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held April 5, 2002 at the project site in Little Rock, Arkansas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria. Only two representatives from each firm will be allowed to attend this conference. 
GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with construction contractors that offer the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The proposed project will be constructed in the Little Rock Downtown Business District. The building will be occupied by the U.S. District Courts, U.S. Magistrate Courts, District Clerk of Court, U.S. Probation Court, Circuit Satellite Library, the U.S. Marshal Service, and GSA joint use space. The annex addition will provide for eight district courtrooms, one special proceedings courtroom, three magistrate courtrooms, offices, sallyport, detention cells, and joint use GSA space, etc. Approximately fifty-five (55) secured, indoor parking spaces will be provided. Occupancy of the annex is planned for the summer of FY 2005. The modernization portion of the contract will be done concurrently with the annex construction and is anticipated to be substantially complete by summer of FY 2007.  The modernization of the existing building includes but is not limited to: mechanical, electrical, plumbing, automatic sprinkler system, fire alarm systems and build out of offices, historical restoration and related hazardous material abatement.  
This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 233320. The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  Profit will not be paid on change orders to the general contractor or its subcontractors with the exception of change orders generated from either differing/unforeseen site conditions or Government requested changes (the successful offeror will have multiple opportunities to review construction documents for comment prior to award under this solicitation).
The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed-Price Incentive Contract (see FAR Part 16.403), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered. 
Offerors in the competitive range (those that make the short list) will be provided a predetermined stipend (approximately $50,000/offeror for their total effort under Stage II & III ). This stipend is to be paid to all firms in the competitive range that participate in good faith following award to the successful offeror. No stipend will be paid to any offeror for their efforts under Stage I.  The entire procurement process will be performed in three (3) Stages. The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for all three stages.
Stage I Submission: During this stage, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for technical and price submissions at 50% design completion documents from those firms responding to this Pre-Solicitation CBD announcement.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s). The technical factors will be as follows - point total 500: (#1) offerors Experience on Similar Projects (150 Points); (#2) offerors Past Performance on Similar Projects (100 Points); (#3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel of the Prime (50 Points); (#4) Management Plan Outline (50 Points); (#5) constructibility Review of the drawings and specifications (100 Points) and; (#6) Cost Estimate (50 Points)(the submission of price will be simultaneous with the submission of the technical data but under separate cover and will be based on documents supplied by the A-E design firm relative to the 50% design completion). This price should reflect the contractor's Firm-Fixed Price Proposal. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of no more than three (3) contractors that offer the best values will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306-(c) to further compete in Stages II and III. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Stage I, II and/or III becomes the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror. 
Stage II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation. The level of effort in this phase includes the following (based on the 95% design submission documents): provide a construction phasing plan, perform a complete constructibility review of the drawings & specifications and provide an updated cost estimate. The technical factors will be as follows - point total 250: (#1) Construction Phasing Plan (100 pts.); (#2) Constructibility Review Comments (100 pts.); (#3) Refined Cost Estimate (50 pts.).  
Stage III Submission: This stage will take place after 100% design completion and will consist of a verbal presentation from the offeror to GSA in Fort Worth, TX on the following factors - point total 250: (#1) Detailed Project Management Plan & Technical Approach (including noise & dust control measures)(100 pts); (#2) Subcontractor Qualifications (50 pts maximum) to include a mandatory, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7 encompassing the following Socio-Economic Program minimum goals: Small Business (49%), Small Disadvantaged Business (13%), Small Women-Owned Business (7%), HUBZone Business (2.5%), and Service-disabled Veteran-owned business (3%)as follows: sub-factor 1) Information on Subcontractor (25 pts) and sub-factor 2) Small Business Subcontracting Plan (25 pts); (#3) Cost Loaded Critical Path Method (CPM) Schedule (50 pts); and price proposal (50 pts). Failure to submit this plan in conjunction with the Stage III final price proposal, when requested, will render the offer unacceptable. 
All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-07P-02-UTC-0008.  Offerors are encouraged to submit their proposals on their most favorable terms and following the combination of the evaluation of technical factors with the final price proposal submission, the Government will award to the firm that offers the best value. 
Following the Pre-Proposal Conference that is scheduled during Stage I, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking Session for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Minority, Woman-Owned, HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned businesses.  The Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms, which are considering bidding on this project.  Prospective small business subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors. Questions about the Networking Session should be directed to Willie Heath, GSA Office of Enterprise Development (817) 978-3284; Internet willie.heath@gsa.gov.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS. End of synopsis.

Wu, Ph.D. The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) at the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is engaged in research to advance the accuracy of dimensional measurements. As part of this effort, EMG is involved in a number of projects involving computer vision. One of the most significant problems in obtaining accurate measurement of dimensions with video cameras is the need to do subpixel interpolation. This project is focused on obtaining detailed information video camera pixel sensitivity to incoming light.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire the services of the proposed contractor to program and document the new Measurement Data Collection System in accordance with the following three (3) tasks:  Task 1. The Contractor shall interface the designated EMG computer to a variety of video cameras.  Two (2) National Instrument Video cards shall be interfaced to a variety of solid state cameras. Interfaces include the Standard Analog RS-170 Interface and newer digital interfaces. The Contractor shall utilize the National Instruments Programming Systems, LabView and EMACS, to build a software system to control each of the video boards, and to record a specific region of interest to a file when prompted. Task 2. The Contractor shall interface the computer system to the NIST M48 Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).

<DESC>Professional land surveying services for the monumentation and posting of Colville National Forest Boundaries.

The project consists of up to 1 records research, 12 each corner searches, 6 miles of control survey, 15 each corner monumentation, 6 miles of marking and posting, 1 job of records and reports and 38 each maintenance of existing corners.  Estimated contract time is 120 calendar days with an estimated start work date of June 24, 2002.  

Interested and qualified firms are invited to respond by submitting one copy of forms SF-254, SF-255 and supplementary narrative and samples as follows: (a) Provide a brief description of steps you will use to complete a project of this type, (b) Describe your corner search process; (c) What measurement and observation techniques will be used to assure compliance with contract specifications?  (d) Some examples of land survey problems you have encountered on similar projects and how you resolved them;  (e) How will corner monumentation be accomplished?  (f) How will marking and posting be accomplished?  (g) How will control survey be accomplished?  (h) How will you accomplish the research needed?  (i) Name, registration number and percent of time, Professional Land Surveyor in charge of project will spend on each phase, and  (j) Submit a copy of a recent survey plat that is representative of your cadastral work.  

Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;  (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials;  (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;  (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;  (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified, given the nature and size of the project; and  (6) Additional points may be assigned or credit given to potential contractors that are or will subcontract with a Small Business Administration certified 8(a) contractor or other small disadvantaged businesses.

Companies interested in offering on the listed NSN, an item other

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.  See Note(s):12 and 26.  Specifications,plans or drawings are not available.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration(base plus option years)shall not exceed 3 years.  This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class: 4720,4730,4820,
5895,5905,5930,5945 and 5990.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive
technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10U.S.C.2304(c)(1).  Approved sources are listed on the aforementioned web site.  While price may be a significant factor
in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a one-year base period contract with four (4) additional one-year option periods to acquire the services of a third-party contractor to provide technical oversight of laboratory services (provided under separate contract to FRA) for toxicological analysis of samples obtained from various railroad employees subject to FRA?s mandatory Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program, as implemented pursuant to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 219 -- Control of Alcohol and Drug Use; and to provide specialized, expert advice and assistance to FRA in accomplishing its objectives and mandates under 49 CFR Part 219 and 49 CFR Part 40 --  Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs.  Since 1986, the FRA has required the special testing of rail crews to determine if drugs or alcohol were either a primary or contributing cause to a significant rail accident or incident.  Following regulation-triggering events, samples are collected by carrier-selected medical facilities using FRA mandatory post-accident split-sample toxicology kits.  Specimens include urine and whole blood for surviving crew members, and urine, whole blood, and tissue for deceased crew members.  Samples are analyzed by utilizing FRA-established cutoffs in urine and whole blood, and results obtained must be scientifically sound and legally defensible.  The third-party technical oversight contractor (contractor) must be capable of assesssing and attesting to the reliability of the Department of Health and Human Services/Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS/SAMHSA) certified laboratory?s capabilities for (1) Receiving and preserving specimen sets.  (2) Accessioning specimens and implementing strict chain-of-custody procedures.  (3) Analyzing specimen sets based on FRA-approved screening and confirmatory protocols using approved immunoassays ranging from KIMS, EIA, RIA, or FPIA to GC/MS.  Additionally, the contractor must provide FRA with ongoing assessments on the qualifications and expertise of the laboratory and assigned personnel relative to the interpretation of test findings and their capabilities to (a) provide expert testimony regarding the laboratory?s analysis of urine, whole blood, and tissue; (b) advise FRA regarding the significance of analytical data in the determination of accident/incident cause and the meaning of test findings with respect to human performance; (c) provide a statement of pharmacological significance related to positive determination, addressing drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, possible usage scenarios, and possible physiological effects; and (d) properly interpret post-mortem findings in light of  possible microbial generation of alcohol.  The FRA contractor is utilized by the FRA to help ensure, though scheduled quarterly inspections using DHHS certified/licensed inspectors and forensic toxicology experts, that the contracted laboratory?s procedures and analysis of FRA samples are scientifically sound and legally defensible, that the laboratory maintains high levels of quality and reliability in its product and service offerings to FRA, and that the laboratory?s operations otherwise fully satisfy the FRA?s Post-Accident Toxicological Testing Program scientific, technical, and administrative goals.  The contractor subjects the laboratory to both open and blind proficiency testing in whole blood and urine.  Samples are constructed by the contractor to challenge the laboratory?s ability to analyze specimens in accordance with approved FRA protocols at established cutoffs.  Following inspections, the contractor drafts (for FRA-approval) reports of findings, recommendations, and/or required changes to operating procedures for implementation by the contracted laboratory.  The contractor is responsible for providing expert advice on Department of Transportation (DOT), Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance guidance documents.  The contractor is responsible for developing or assisting in the preparation of materials and the conduct of technical training for FRA, Office of Safety, Operating Practices (OP) inspectors (Federal and state).  The contractor must be prepared to individually instruct or co-instruct classes in urine specimen collection, laboratory analysis, MRO functions, Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) functions, breath specimen collection, mandatory post-accident specimen collection for both surviving and deceased crew members, and other topics as assigned.  The contractor is responsible for providing FRA with one or more technical experts for Part 219 compliance audits of both rail carriers and their service providers at various designated locations throughout the country.  Contractor technical experts must be prepared to act as senior adjunct members of a team of FRA inspectors auditing all drug and alcohol requirements of the applicable federal rules (both Part 219 and Part 40).  Special expertise is required in urine, blood, and breath specimen collection; collection chain-of-custody and documentation; laboratory procedures, analysis, and test result documentation; MRO procedures and documentation; SAP procedures and documentation; and other elements and requirements of said rules.  The contractor is responsible for development or updating of the Part 219 Compliance Manual for FRA OP Inspectors that provides detailed protocol on how to properly evaluate all Part 219 and Part 40 elements, and the Part 219 Compliance Manual for the railroad industry that provides regulated carriers with specific guidelines on how to comply with all Part 219 requirements, including service provider and carrier responsibilities and record keeping.  The contractor is also responsible for developing and presenting seminars specifically designed to show regulated carriers how to properly comply with Part 219 drug and alcohol regulations, and seminars/training modules for OP inspectors to certify them as Part 219 compliance field experts.  As of the release/posting of this notice, it is anticipated that on or about March 15, 2002,  the subject solicitation will be issued (i.e., made available) in electronic media and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (formerly known as the Electronic Posting System (EPS)).  Once posted, the solicitation may be download or printed from the following Internet address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ (the same site is also accessible/co-located at http://www.eps.gov).

The FRA intends to state in the solicitation that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  At the conclusion of the FRA?s evaluations of offers (and any negotiations or discussions if such are conduct (with offerors in the competitive range), as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority (SSA), and the submission and evaluation of any final proposal revisions, if such are requested by the Contracting Officer/SSA), the SSA will make a determination as to which offer is of the best value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors and subfactors set forth in the solicitation, and make contract award to that single, responsible source/offeror.  This is an unrestricted, competitive procurement.  All eligible, responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is responsible for administration and coordination of most of the extramural clinical trials supported by the DCTD.  It is also responsible for the ongoing clinical development of more than 100 agents on which the Division has filed more than 150 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The CTEP must prepare, file and manage INDs for the investigational agents it sponsors in clinical trials, including the agents from the NCI's intramural clinical programs.  As the sponsor of these agents, DCTD must design a plan for the efficient evaluation and development of these agents and monitor the safety, efficacy and drug distribution of the agents in the trials, tracking the progress of the studies both administratively and scientifically, review and transmit adverse events in a timely manner and preparing IND annual reports for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), investigator brochures for agents and other special reports and manuscripts. The CTEP must also submit amendments to the INDs it sponsors including new protocols, protocol amendments, adverse events, updated chemistry and manufacturing information, compassionate exemptions and responses to FDA communications.  At least annually, federal law requires that an IND sponsor analyze and summarize all results from the investigational agent?s development in an Annual Report submitted to the FDA on the anniversary of the IND filing.  These results are reported to the CTEP by, quarterly and annual data updates (Clinical Data Update System, CDUS), biweekly by the Clinical Trials Monitoring System, by publications, Cooperative Group reports and periodic meetings with clinical investigators.  Annual Reports are reviewed and used by the Program Medical Staff who develop future plans for the agent.  IND sponsors have the obligation to inform investigators, the Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), NIH (for gene transfer studies) and the FDA of any serious or unexpected Adverse Events (AEs) that have been observed.  When AE reports are made to the CTEP, Program staff analyze and categorize them according to severity. 

The Contractor shall provide support to the CTEP, Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) and Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB) for a wide range of services related to these responsibilities.
These services include assistance with  Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), investigational agent development and clinical research information management; assessment of adverse events, logistical and clerical support.   

It is anticipated that one award will be made and that the resulting contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of 6 years.  The Government?s requirement is 67,000 hours per year for a total of 405,600 total hours over the 6 years.   RFP N02-CM-27022-32 will be available on or about 10/15/01 with a due date for receipt of 11/16/01.  For further information, the Request Proposals will be available on the NCI Research Contracts Branch web site at: http://rcb-inter.nci.nih.gov/appl/rfp/rfps_published.jsp on or about 10/15/01.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue solicitation No. NIMH-01-DN-0018 entitled "Mouse Neuroscience Phenotyping and Distributing Center" as a full and open competitive procurement under NAICS Code 541710.  The NIMH proposed to award a one year contract with five - one year options.  Some aspects of the Statement of Work  (SOW) will be reimbursed on a fixed unit price basis while other aspects of the (SOW) will be reimbursed on a cost basis.  With the elucidation of the complete draft sequence of the human and other mammalian genomes, the next challenge is to conduct large-scale functional analyses of these genomes to greatly enhance our understanding of neurobiology.  The laboratory mouse plays a pivotal role in human functional genomic, insofar as mouse strains carrying mutations have provided useful models for human diseases.  RFA MH-99-007, "Mouse Mutagenesis and Phenotyping: Nervous System and Behavior" was issued in 1999 to establish neuroscience-focused facilities for large-scale, efficient, whole-genome mutagenesis, in order to promote the systematic and comprehensive functional analysis of neurobiological and behavioral phenotypes in the mouse.  Cooperative Agreements for three large-scale mutagenesis and phenotyping facilities that focus on abnormalities in nervous system function and behavior were funded under the RFA.  A major goal of this initiative is to provide the scientific community with new research resources, i.e., mutant animals in a timely fashion.  The expected production of mutants generated by the three neuroscience-focused mutagenesis facilities exceeds the capacity of existing mouse storage and distribution facilities.  In order to realize the full potential for the scientific community of mutants produced in the three mutagenesis facilities, the NIMH is seeking to establish a large-scale phenotyping and distribution "virtual" center.  The virtual center shall be comprised of a network of investigators with expertise in different phenotypic domains, database/bioinformatics experts who can construct a state-of-the-art database in response to the needs of the neuroscience and behavioral communities and adequate capacity to maintain and distribute mutant strains.  The specific functions to be performed by this virtual center include:  (1) confirmatory phenotyping of various nervous system functions and complex behaviors in mutant mice received from the three mutagenesis facilities; (2) maintenance of mutant strains as live animals, and cryopreserved materials (embryos or ovaries and sperm); (3) wide distribution to the scientific community of mutant strains in a very timely fashion; and (4) development and curation of a public database of neuroscience-relevant phenotypic information from mutant strains.  In addition to the above, the contract shall also contain an option for the performance of additional services.  The additional services that could be required include the baseline phenotyping of nine inbred strains (129/SvlmJ, A/J, BALB/cJ, BTBR, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CAST/Ei, DBA/2J, and FVB/NJ) on neuroscience-relevant domains, mapping of mutations to a higher resolution than originally done by the three mutagenesis facilities, and  breeding of mutations into balanced and congenic stocks on specified genetic backgrounds for distribution to the scientific community.  To eliminate the potential for patents on mutant mice and cryopreserved materials that would undermine the development of a widely available national resource the successful offeror must agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed by the employment of  FAR Clauses 52.227-11, "Patent Rights (Deviation)" and 52.227-14, "Rights in Data-General (Deviation)".  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIMH-01-DN-0018 will be available on or about June 19, 2001, and receipt of proposals will be due on or about November 9, 2001.  The RFP may be accessed electronically through the NIMH Homepage at http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ .  First click on Funding Opportunities, then click on Contracts and scroll down to the RFP Number.  This RFP may also be accessed electronically at FEDBIZOPPS at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ .  Please note that the RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Reporting Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria and the Proposal Preparation Instructions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package.  Following proposal submission and the initial review process, offerors included in the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

Technical evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, as proposals become more equal, pr ice becomes more important and may become a determining factor for award. Based on best value, an award may not necessarily go to the highest rated technical proposal or to the lowest price offer. A tradeoff process may be used to determine the best overal l value. If multiple contracts are awarded, the Government may compete the work among the contractors based on performance and other factors set forth in the contract.

<DESC>N68335-02-RFI-3184  REPLACEMENT OF THE RL-293/M ANTENNA TENSIONER/REELING MACHINE (AT/RM) FOR THE E-6 AIRCRAFT AIRBORNE STRATEGIC COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS (C3) PROGRAM


THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  RFI regarding replacement of the RL-293/M Antenna Tensioner/Reeling Machine for the E-6 aircraft.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) is considering the possibility of procuring Antenna Tensioners/Reeling Machines (AT/RM) as support equipment (SE) for the C3 E-6 aircraft, utilizing non-developmental item (NDI) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts to the maximum extent possible. NAWCADLKE is the cognizant field activity (CFA) involving SE for PMA-271.  The RL-293/M is currently being used at the organizational maintenance level (O-level), and is the only method to remove and replace (R/R) the antenna wires installed on the E-6 aircraft.  The loss of this peculiar support equipment (PSE) item prohibits mission accomplishment.  The E-6 Program has a requirement for six reeling machines to support the Main Operating Base (MOB), Forward Operating Base (FOB), and a training asset, which are documented in the Individual Material Readiness Lists (IMRLs).  The antenna wires vary from 4,800 to 28,500 feet in length.  The RL-293/M has been in service for 30 years and a replacement is required due to escalating obsolescence.  The RL-293/M current bill of materials includes 63 high-risk components for which no spare/repair parts exist and are non-procurable.  Another 640 non-spared parts are considered medium risk because they will require engineering efforts to identify substitute/alternate parts and alternate sources upon failure.  Supportability of the current RL-293/M presents a significant readiness deficiency and is a cost driver to the future of E-6 Program.  The following information is requested regarding the AT/RM:  principles of operation, design criteria and concepts (including drives, platform, wire management, controls and operator interface), applicable power source candidates, and maintenance (logistic) requirements.  Other information to be provided shall include weights, dimensions, power (HP/KW), speeds (wire velocity-feet per minute), and manufacturing/construction time. Also provide a discussion concerning an overall performance goal, including supportability, exceeding that of the current AT/RM SE (RL-293/M).  The proposed AT/RM must be compatible with any existing E6 aircraft interfaces. It is requested that the information be submitted NO LATER THAN 21 MARCH 2002 to Mr. Joseph Bolmarcich, NAWCADLKE (Code 2.5.2.2), Building 562, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733, who may be reached at (732) 323-2533.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in the response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in 
Kampala, Uganda will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 7, Expanded Sustainable Economic Opportunities for Rural Sector Growth.   This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007.  The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf .  A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Ugandas Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued.  The solicitation will seek proposals to design and implement the Productive Resource Investments For Managing the Environment (PRIME) activity through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase.   This activity will build on the successful approaches and results of current activities and those nearing completion, which were begun in the period prior to the new ISP.  The primary objective of PRIME will be to increase economic opportunities and income of rural communities in selected regions of Uganda through significant improvements in the management, conservation and sustainable use of important natural resource assets.  To request a copy of the solicitation that will be ready for distribution on or about February 28, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: snagwere@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417.   We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.   (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy).  You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet.   As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation at FBO.  Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments.  NAICS:  541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $20-$25 million.

<DESC>PROCUREMENT INVITATION NOTICE
TO ALL INTERESTED BIDDERS

HQ AMC intends to issue a Request for Proposal for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command located at Ft Campbell KY.  Air transportation services are required to transport up to six (6) passengers with personal baggage or 1500 lbs of cargo, from Ft Campbell KY and Ft Benning GA to various CONUS locations.

In past contracts, a base period with two option periods have been included in the contract; however, there have been significant changes in the airline industry for Part 135 carriers in the past year, including fluctuating fuel prices, constant increases in aviation insurance, and new security measures and laws being implemented.  It is being questioned if a fixed-price contract for a base year and two option periods would place undue risk on Part 135 carriers since it is impossible to predict what new security laws will be implemented, fuel prices, and what to expect each year for insurance increases.  

We request that you please take a few moments to complete the questions below concerning this procurement.  Your comments are important to us.

1.  Do you feel insurance rates have stabilized or will continue to increase?_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.  Would you prefer to see a contract with a base year and only one option period, or would it be preferable to have multiple (up to four) option periods (Remember, this is a fixed-price contract and there will be no contract increases over the period of the contract for insurance increases, fuel increases, etc.)  You must bid your option years accordingly.________________________________
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________

3.  To protect against fuel increases, would you prefer a fuel adjustment clause in the contract (a guaranteed fuel price), or include the price for fuel in your bid price?_____________________
__________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________

Please return questionnaire to Jere.Gainey@scott.af.mil, or FAX (618) 256-2804.  If you have any questions, I can be reached at 618-229-2483.

<SUBJECT>D -- Federal Trade Commission''s Proposed National Do-Not Call Registry
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-2-0001
<RESPDATE>032902
<ARCHDATE>04132002
<CONTACT>Eric Vogt, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 326-2259, Fax (202) 326-3529, Email evogt@ftc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.

Federal Trade Commission's Proposed National Do-Not Call Registry.

	The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking information that may assist in the development, deployment and operation of a proposed national registry of telephone numbers of consumers who do not wish to receive telephone calls from telemarketers.  The FTC is also soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors that can accomplish this task.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Funding has been requested of Congress for this project.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.

Background
	On January 30, 2002, the FTC published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to amend the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule and to request public comment on the proposed changes.  67 Fed. Reg. 4492 (Jan. 30, 2002).  The FTC also plans to publish a proposed Privacy Act System Notice in the near future.  (Information about the NPR and proposed Privacy Act System Notice can be found at  www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/ donotcall/index.htm.)  Among other provisions, the NPR proposes to establish a national do-not-call registry, maintained by the FTC.  The proposal, if adopted, would permit consumers who prefer not to receive telemarketing calls to contact one centralized registry to effectuate this preference.  Telemarketers would be required to refrain from calling consumers who have put themselves on this registry.  The NPR anticipates that telemarketers would need to access the do-not-call registry on at least a monthly basis in order to remove from their telemarketing lists those consumers who have placed themselves on the national registry.
	In developing this proposed registry, the FTC has five primary concerns.  The FTC wants to ensure:  (1) the accuracy and validity of the consumer telephone numbers added to the registry;  (2) the capacity of the system to handle the potential volume of consumer requests to be placed on the registry; (3) the security of the information maintained in the registry; (4) the accessibility of the registry to telemarketers and law enforcement and regulatory agents; and (5) the lowest possible system costs.
	If a national do-not-call registry is adopted, the FTC envisions the following as one possible method of operating this system.  Consumers who wish to enroll in the national registry could do so by calling a toll-free number from the telephone line they wish to register and accessing an automated system.  The system could capture the automatic number identification (ANI) of the number calling the system.  The system could then validate the origin of the call by asking the caller to enter, on his or her telephone keypad, the number of the telephone line the caller wishes to register.  The system could automatically check the entered number against the ANI data.  If the numbers match, the caller could be advised that the number is registered, and the telephone call would end.  If the numbers do not match, the caller could be given instructions and/or options on how to register properly.  At a minimum, this process would validate that the individual registering a telephone number is calling from the telephone line being registered, and that individual knows the number he or she is registering.  This validation helps ensure that only consumers who actually wish to be placed on the do-not-call list are placed there.
	Telemarketers who do business in the United States may need to access the registry as frequently as once per month.  Estimates on the number of telemarketers in the United States have ranged from 40,000 to 100,000.  In addition, appropriate FTC and possibly State employees may need to access the registry for law enforcement or other authorized purposes.  The FTC anticipates that such access could be available though a secure Internet website.  Validation would have to occur to ensure that only appropriate entities are allowed access to the registry.  Once secure access is achieved, information in the registry should be sortable and downloadable, as necessary.  The information in the system, including dates of consumer registration and telemarketer access to the registry, will need to be maintained for a sufficient period of time to allow for effective law enforcement and tracking purposes.
	If fees are charged for accessing the registry, a system may have to be developed to bill, process, and deposit those fees.  There may also need to be a system to collect delinquent accounts.
	The basic details of the system outlined above may change as a result of the comments received in response to the NPR.  In fact, the NPR asks a series of questions concerning the operation of the national registry.  See 67 Fed. Reg. at 4538-39 (questions 5-9).  The FTC solicits  comments from potential vendors concerning these questions as well.
	States that have established statewide do-not-call registries have experienced consumer registration levels ranging from a few percent of the telephone lines in use within the State, to over 40 percent of all lines.  The FTC understands that there are approximately 150 million telephone lines in the United States.  If consumers responsible for 40 percent of all U.S. telephone lines sign up for a national do-not-call registry, the registry may ultimately include 60 million telephone numbers.  In addition, there may be significant demand to access the registry at peak times.
	The most critical piece of information captured by the registry is the telephone number of the registering consumer.  In fact, it may be the only piece of information that the system needs to capture, along with the date the registration occurred.  The NPR seeks comment on issues that may result in additional information being captured, however.  For example, the NPR asks whether the do-not-call registry should be structured in a two-tiered fashion, so that requests not to receive telemarketing calls to induce the purchase of goods and services be handled separately from requests not to receive calls soliciting charitable contributions.  The NPR also asks whether the do-not-call registry should allow consumers to specify the days or times of day that they are willing to accept telemarketing calls.

Information Requested
	In responding to this RFI, the FTC asks potentially interested vendors to submit information on the following subjects.  All responses should be a maximum of 20 pages, excluding printed marketing brochures and corporate or product information.  Please number your answers to match the question numbers below.
	1.	Is the proposed system outlined above feasible and practical?  Is there an alternative system that can be developed which provides an equal or greater level of consumer validation, registry security, and registry accessibility at a lower cost?
	2.	Briefly describe the system you would be capable of providing to the FTC should the proposed do-not-call registry go into effect.  Include a brief description of the technical architecture of your proposed system, the methods used to handle the potential volume of consumer requests to register, and the security measures, including the tracking and accounting of disclosures, you would put into place to protect the registry information.
	3.	Briefly describe how you would allow telemarketer and law enforcement access to the registry.  How would the potential size of the registry effect that access?  Note that telemarketers with different levels of technical sophistication may need to access the registry.  Also describe how you would ensure or authenticate that only appropriate entities obtain access to the registry information.
	4.	Is it possible for your system to delete consumer telephone numbers automatically once those numbers have been disconnected and/or reassigned to new consumers?  How would you obtain this information?  From what source?  How reliable and complete is the information obtained from this source?  What are the potential costs for obtaining this information?
	5.	What procedures could be established to update the numbers in the do-not-call registry when the area codes associated with those numbers change?
	6.	What procedures could your system offer to consumers who want to verify that their numbers have been placed in the do-not-call registry?  To consumers who want to delete or change their information contained in the registry?
	7.	Describe the specific billing and collection mechanisms you would use if fees are charged to access the registry.
	8.	Describe your expectations concerning the rights you would maintain in any part of the proposed system you would develop.  The FTC expects that the data collected in the registry would be the government's property and cannot be used for any non-governmental purpose other than for telemarketers to come into compliance with the Telemarketing Sales Rule.  The FTC also expects to require that the proposed system comply with the requirements and standards of the Federal Records Act, Rehabilitation Act (e.g., section 508), the Privacy Act, and any other applicable statutes, regulations, or orders.
	9.	Provide estimates of the cost of your proposed system, in total and/or per transaction.  Indicate the amount of those costs necessary to build or develop the system and the amount necessary to operate it.  Do any of these cost estimates change based on the volume of transactions that occur?  Finally, provide an estimate of the time necessary for you to implement your proposed system.
	10.	Briefly describe your company, products, services, history, ownership and any other information you deem relevant.  In particular, describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, and any relevant lessons learned.
	11.	Include any suggestions on acquisition strategies that the FTC should use for this project, e.g., performance based statement of work, turn-key approach, two-stepped sealed bidding, etc.
	12.	Include any comments on the structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.
	13.	Include the relevant information if your services are available on a GSA schedule or other contract vehicle.
	14.	Identify the commercial performance matrix and incentives that should be used.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) along with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is interested in gaining information regarding industry solutions to provide the Management and Control (M&C) Segment of the DOD Teleport.  The DOD Teleport services will provide the deployed warfighter expanded satellite communications capability and DISN service access for worldwide operations.  It is the expansion of the Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) program begun in the early 1990s.  The DOD Teleport will provide centralized integration capabilities, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces (satellite and terrestrial) to access the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable and economical manner.  Using technology insertion, the capabilities of the DOD Teleport system will be enhanced as the warfighter's information technology needs advance.  The DOD Teleport will be constructed such that new technology can be easily inserted as the needs of the warfighters evolve. For Generation 1, the six Teleport sites are located in Northwest, VA; Fort Buckner, Okinawa; Wahiawa, HI; Lago di Patria, Italy; Ramstein, Germany; and Camp Roberts, CA.  Follow on work may include Teleport sites in Bahrain and Landstuhl, Germany. The M&C segment description and requirements are contained in the draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) and its Attachment A  are available at the link below. Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 1)  Review of and comments on the draft SOO 2)  Conceptual technical architecture alternatives      Rely heavily on COTS products with minimum customization      Technical feasibility alternatives assessments      Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives      Schedule estimates to meet Gen 1 and future requirements      Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to managing and controlling Teleport Sample Response Outline Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.  Due to the speed of the RFI process, and the extent with which innovation is being requested and considered, the quality and depth of the responses to the RFI will be especially important.  Responses that are excessively "boilerplate", lack technical depth, or reflect commonly-available product information (recitation of stock product offerings) are not recommended.  In the event that a more thorough response is not possible, teaming/partnering may be advisable. Section 1 - Review and Comment on the Statement of Objectives (SOO) Industry is requested to review the Statement of Objectives and provide the Government with ideas and suggestions for improvements regarding: a) the technical clarity of the SOO; b) the definition of the objectives in the SOO; and c) the understanding of the phased approach desired by the Government for this effort. At a minimum, Government requests that responses for this Section be delivered using the SOO Microsoft Word file with the "Track Changes" feature enabled.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This announcement is for the re-initiation of an earlier project that was delayed due to urgent support of current hostilities.  This announcement cancels and replaces SOL N00164-01-R-0102.  The Navy is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operation Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program, the Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Ground Weapons and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Industries interested in participation in SOPMOD that have not already done so should first register, or update their registry information, with Ms. Paula Pifer, Code 4081, telephone (812) 854-5686, email pifer_p@crane.navy.mil Sources are sought that can provide an Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) that attaches to host rifles and carbines, as well as functioning in a stand-alone mode.  US Speci al Operations Forces (SOF) and certain other Government activities operate around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments.  They subject their weapons and equipment to extremely high usage rates and stresses.  Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its equipment, normal military specifications are in many cases not stringent enough to support SOF use.  Although the currently fielded M203 40mm Grenade Launcher meets existing military performance specifications, the M203 has exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.   Specific M203 shortfalls include (1) Barrel mount design degrades host weapon accuracy, (2) Quick Detach Mount is fragile and complex, (3) Cannot load longer 138mm+ ammo, (4 ) Unreliable in surf, sand, and mud, (5) Inaccurate, requires many (costly) rounds and hours to train, (6) Most of current ammo stockpile is old and inaccurate.  The SOPMOD Program, MARCORSYSCOM, and the FBI are not seeking alternative sources for the current M203-series grenade launchers.  This program, instead, seeks EGLMs that demonstrate operational and technical improvements over the current M203-series grenade launchers.  EGLM is envisioned to replace the M203 in Special Operations Forces and possibly, the US Marine Corps and the FBI.   The objective requirement is to rapidly field a quick attach/detach enhanced 40mm grenade launcher module that fires the current inventory of U.S. and NATO 40mm ammunition as well as a new generation of enhanced, non-developmental munitions.  EGLM core goal is increased day/night lethality, with first-round effect on target the objectiv e, and second-round effect on target the threshold.  The EGLM must not attach to the barrel of the host weapon, rather will attach to a rigid 6:00 MILSPEC 1913 rail on the host weapon.  EGLM is envisioned as an individual grenade launcher combined with a ballistic self-ranging sight and/or range finding and/or stadiametric ranging sight that is day/night capable.  Compatibility with US and NATO in-service 40mm Low Velocity (LV) ammunition is required.  Future compatibility (AKA “upgradeable”) is also sought with yet-undeveloped low-velocity 40mm rounds, to include programmable rounds.  The EGLM must be capable of removal from the host weapon and fired in a stand-alone configuration, and should therefore have provision for a pistol grip and/or an accessory buttstock.  The breech mechanism should open to the side rather than forward like the current M203.  Side opening is to a llow the operator to chamber and fire shorter standard cartridges up to 134mm in length as well as longer NATO cartridges.  Side loading will also facilitate reloading in difficult or awkward shooting positions.  The barrel release latch and mechanical safety should be located in a position that will alleviate or eliminate inadvertent activation.  The trigger mechanism must not require the operator to open the breech in order to cock or re-cock the weapon.  Controls should be ambidextrous and intuitive.   Improvements should also include improved reliability, durability, service-life, and ergonomics.  Performance is more clearly defined in a draft performance specification that includes Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Additional Performance Parameters (APPs).  It is available for download at www.crane.navy.mil/supply/synopss.htm.  We invite potential candidate firms to  provide written comments on this draft specification with their responses to this market survey.  Should you require further technical information regarding this announcement, the SOPMOD Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) is Mr. Bobby Just, Code 4081, Bldg. 2521, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Port Security Grants Program
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT

Transportation Security Administration

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is announcing the Port Security Grants Program based on the seaport security provisions contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-117, H.R. Conf. Rpt 107-350). TSA is coordinating with the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in this effort.


Program Description: 
TSA is planning to award competitive grants to critical national seaports to finance the cost of enhancing facility and operational security. Grants shall be awarded based on the need for security assessments and enhancements as determined by the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, and the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

Grant applications will be accepted for two categories:

1. Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies ? Award based on proposed port or terminal security assessments that ascertain vulnerabilities and identify mitigation strategies.

2. Enhanced Facility and Operational Security ? Including but not limited to facility access control, physical security, cargo security and passenger security. Interested parties applying for grants under the second category must provide a copy of the port or terminal security assessments with their application. Consideration will also be given to proof-of-concept demonstration projects which can demonstrate how port security would be improved/enhanced by their implementation.

Eligible Parties:
Critical National Seaports/Terminals. To be considered a critical national seaport/terminal, one or more of the following attributes must be met:
&#61623; One of the 13 designated ?strategic ports?, as designated by a Maritime Administration port planning order.
&#61623; Controlled Port ? Ports which have access controls for vessels from certain countries due to national security issues. Controlled ports are: New London/Groton, CT; Portsmouth, NH (including Kittery, Maine and Dover, New Hampshire on the Piscataqua River); Hampton Roads, VA (including Norfolk, Newport News, Jamestown, Yorktown, and Portsmouth, VA); Charleston, SC; Kings Bay, GA; Port Canaveral, FL; Panama City, FL; Pensacola, FL; Port St. Joe, FL; Port Hueneme, CA; San Diego, CA; and Honolulu, HI.
&#61623; A nationally important economic port responsible for a large volume of cargo movement or for movement of products that are vital to U.S. economic interests as required for national security.
&#61623; Ports or terminals responsible for movement of high volume of passengers. 

Required Content of Applications:
Category 1 ? Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies
&#61623; Description of why the port is a critical national seaport.  Is the terminal located within a critical national seaport and is it a critical terminal? Explain.
&#61623; Indicate type and volume of commodities handled at the facility(s).
&#61623; Description of plan and methodology for proposed assessment.
&#61623; Give details on who will conduct the assessment. If utilizing a security company/specialist or internal security specialist, provide details on security assessment capabilities/expertise.
&#61623; Indicate the support/involvement of the appropriate federal, state, and local governments. 
&#61623; Identify any security measures that were implemented since 9/11/01 by the port/terminal and include costs and source of funding for these measures.

Category 2 - Enhanced Facility and Operational Security 
&#61623; Description of why the port is a critical national seaport.  Is the terminal located within a critical national seaport and is it a critical terminal?  Explain.
&#61623; Indicate type and volume of commodities handled at the facility(s).
&#61623; Describe the proposed methodology including location(s), support and involvement of appropriate federal, state and local governments.
&#61623; Describe the critical security vulnerability(s) addressed by the project.
&#61623; Describe anticipated  reduction of vulnerability based on the implementation of the proposed project; organizing by categories (accessibility, organic security, hardness).
&#61623; Describe impact of not implementing proposed measures.
&#61623; Identify any security measures that were implemented since 9/11/01 by the port/terminal and include costs and source of funding for these measures.
&#61623; Include port security assessment and description of existing security measures, including, but not limited to identification procedures, access control, internal security, perimeter security, security alarms/video surveillance/communication systems, training and security awareness, and security plans.
&#61623; Proof-of-concept description/methodology including a detailed description of the proposed technology, expected outcome, cost-sharing arrangements, if any, and how the proposed methodology would improve/enhance national security.

Required Information for applications in either category (in addition to the requirements listed above):
&#61623; Cost/budget information in sufficient detail, including costs broken out by labor, equipment, material, travel, etc., to permit the government to make a reasonableness determination regarding the requested funding.
&#61623; Cost effectiveness of the project.

&#61623; Detailed schedules to allow for evaluation of the realism of the proposed plan.
&#61623; All technical information must be presented in sufficient detail and in either phases or project milestones to allow for separate funding.



Evaluation Criteria:
In evaluating the grant applications the government will consider the following:

&#61623; Is the applicant a critical national seaport/terminal?  (go/no-go factor)
&#61623; Has a security assessment been performed?  (prerequisite for Category 2 applications)
&#61623; Inherent risk/need because of the nature/location of the port/terminal.
&#61623; Proposed approach addresses critical security need/vulnerability.
&#61623; Solution provides solid mitigation of identified vulnerability.
&#61623; Failure to implement proposed solution/approach results in a high degree of security risk.
&#61623; Probability of successful implementation is high.
&#61623; The proposed approach is technically sound and clearly addresses the vulnerabilities identified in the Port or Terminal Security Assessment (applicable to Category 2 applications).
&#61623; The proposed cost/request for funding is realistic when compared to the proposed solution.
&#61623; Proposed key personnel have the qualifications to implement the proposed approach.
&#61623; The proposed schedule is realistic for project implementation.
&#61623; Proposed methodology is realistic.

Evaluation Process:
&#61623; Pre-applications will be reviewed to confirm that the applicant is in the correct stated USCG Captain of the Port zone and to review number and scope of anticipated grant proposals.
&#61623; Applications will be reviewed by the appropriate USCG Captain of the Port and Maritime Region Director and validated if the grant application addresses a needed security measure at a critical national seaport or terminal and should be considered for emergency grant funding.  (go/no-go criteria)
&#61623; Applications will be initially reviewed by the appropriate USCG Captain of the Port and Maritime Region Director and prioritized based on risk.
&#61623; Upon conclusion of regional/COTP reviews, applications will be reviewed at the TSA, MARAD and USCG Headquarters level against stated evaluation criteria.
&#61623; Final review will be conducted by an executive team prior to a decision briefing to the Selection Board, consisting of the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, and the Commandant of the Coast Guard (or their representatives).
&#61623; The government reserves the right to award grants in total or part, depending on the technical assessment and availability of funding.

 

Application Process:
All grant applications will be submitted, evaluated, awarded (if selected) and administered electronically through www.portsecuritygrants.dottsa.net
Concurrently, the Broad Agency Announcement will be published in FedBizOpps and applicable trade magazines.
