prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having

access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that
each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will 
be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly 
for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g.,"Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal
in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse   
Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other

offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be  
considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be

accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer 
decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are

again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.

<DESC>1. General. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT Notice and is for informational/market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS, NOR A SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION UNDER FAR SUBPART 5.2.
<p>2. Contract Information. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (CENWP), is seeking a firm to rehabilitate the regulating outlet (RO) system at Fall Creek Dam. Fall Creek Dam is located on Fall Creek, a tributary of the Middle Fork Willamette River, about 20 miles southeast of the city of Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<p>There are two RO tunnels at Fall Creek Dam and four RO gates. Each tunnel has a service gate and an emergency gate in series. The RO gates are hydraulically actuated 5'-6" x 10' slide gates utilizing a common hydraulic power unit that actuates the hydraulic system of each gate. The hydraulic power unit is fed electrically from the facility's main service motor control center (MCC) and the local RO distribution panel. The system has a local control panel and remote SCADA control for operation of the gates. The RO gate hydraulic system, electrical infrastructure, and controls are original and due to the age of the system many of the components have exceeded or are near the end of their expected service life and many parts are now obsolete. The objective of this project is to rehabilitate the RO gates, the associated hydraulic power unit, the supporting electrical infrastructure, and controls to comply with current codes and standards and to improve the reliability of the RO system.</p>
<p>For each RO tunnel, the contractor will have eight (8) months (March through October) to conduct necessary work and return the tunnel to service. The work will take place over two years. The contractor must ensure the electrical and mechanical work is accomplished in a way that maintains at least one RO tunnel in service at all times. The contractor will install and remove bulkheads to isolate the RO tunnels for construction work. The Government will furnish the downstream bulkhead and the contractor will fabricate a new upstream bulkhead rated for the full pool of the reservoir.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation of the RO system will include mandatory replacement items as well as optional replacement items. The decision on whether to replace optional items will be made by the Government based on non-destructive testing to be conducted by the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor will fabricate replacement parts, demolish the existing hydraulic power system, disassemble each gate assembly, remove the gates and transport them for off-site rehabilitation, conduct non-destructive testing as noted below, install replacement parts, and reassemble and commission the RO system. The contractor will also provide as-builts and O&amp;M manuals.</p>
<p>Specific scope items are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Inspect welds on each gate and repair as needed;<br />&bull; Prepare the surface and apply a coating to the skin plates of each of four RO gates;<br />&bull; Repair the gate slots, seals and sill plates;<br />&bull; Fabricate a new upstream bulkhead;<br />&bull; Demolish existing hydraulic power system;<br />&bull; Replace the hydraulic power unit;<br />&bull; Replace the hydraulic pistons, gate stems, and seals;<br />&bull; Replace the hydraulic seals;<br />&bull; Disassemble and inspect each 30" diameter hydraulic cylinder (optional item for replacement);<br />&bull; Disassemble and inspect the bonnet covers (optional item for replacement);<br />&bull; Replace the hydraulic lines and hydraulic oil;<br />&bull; Rehabilitate or replace the hydraulic reservoir;<br />&bull; Replace local and remote indication, controls, and SCADA;<br />&bull; Replace motor control center, feeders, panel boards;<br />&bull; Replace diesel generator, generator controls, and transfer switches; and;<br />&bull; Replace lighting and cameras.</p>
<p>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. The official Synopsis citing the solicitation number will be issued on Federal Business Opportunities www.fbo.gov and inviting firms to register electronically to receive a copy of the solicitation when it is issued.</p>

<p>(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.</p>
<p>Other End Products</p>
<p>Line Item No.: Country of Origin:</p>
<p>[List as necessary]<br /><br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under<br />I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a<br /><br />final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under<br />I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to<br />I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.<br />&sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). [_] TIN: . [_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:</p>

<p><br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of- name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)<br /><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract,<br />e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.<br />The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
