<DESC>SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is seeking to purchase a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computerized forecasting model of the U.S. economy.  The model can be either web-based or software.  The COTS model should be able to do the following:

·	provide forecasts for a minimum of twenty-four quarters, and the necessary historical data that allow for the forecasts.
·	provide forecasts for as many variables as possible comprising OCC’s analytical products (see variable list in Appendix which contains the variables divided into a ‘primary list’ and a ‘secondary list’) and, at a minimum, provide forecasts for all the variables on the primary list.
·	for variables on the secondary list not forecasted by the model, the model should be capable of either including equations OCC will use for those variables or of easily bridging to those equations.
·	be easy to manipulate with regard to length of forecast and forecast variables.
·	allow certain critical variables to be made exogenous with a minimum of effort.
 
The resultant contract's period of performance will be a base period and two option years.

HOW TO ACQUIRE A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION:   OCC anticipates issuing the solicitation in November 2005, at www.fedbizopps.gov.   The solicitation will contain the details of the requirement, the instructions for submitting a quote, and how the quotes will be evaluated.  

This is NOT a small business set-aside.  It is a full and open competition using simplified acquisition procedures.  All responsible companies may submit a quote that will be considered by the OCC.  

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in December 2005.

<DESC>Currently SPDD is training Public Order Battalions at An Numaniyah, but with the changing environment in Iraq, SPDD must be able to train Commandos, Public Order, 1st Mechanized, ERU or any other Police team from a standardized curriculum and from any location deemed appropriate for training.  This Delivery Order must be flexible enough to change with the emerging requirements or locations.   As Special Police teams fill to their mandated strength, it will be important to execute advanced and specialized training.   The Development of Train the Trainer and leadership courses will ensure the continued success and transfer of training, base/life support and operational sustainment to the Iraqis.   

The contractor must be able to team with the US and Iraqi government to provide solutions to the transformation. The primary goal is to train and transfer the training, operations and logistical support to the Iraqi government.  When pricing, the contractor shall keep in mind that the government is seeking a LOE delivery order that will provide flexibility in training and training locations.  Although we understand that specific CLINs need to be priced separately, it is important to price LOE labor categories that will allow the government to increase or decrease labor requirements.

The contractor is to conduct training, provide base / life support and force protection required to sustain POB training.    The POB cadre attends training to develop skills required to maintain law and order, protect critical infrastructure, and assume counter insurgency operations in support of local police duties.  The contractor will utilize the approved CPATT Public Order Programs of Instructions (POIs). Any modifications to the POI will be reviewed and approved by the COR and SPDD.

The contractor will also accept the tasking of developing specialized courses that will provide leadership and management skill to the Officer and Selected leaders of the cadets.  The leadership course will be dual tracked; a primary leadership for students attending the basic training course, and a sustainment course to enhance leader skills after serving in the field.

The contractor shall provide all administrative, logistical and training resources to support this program of instruction.  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to provide for the base support of each of the training cycles. The estimated POB population is initially 1500, which includes cadets, ex patriots, Iraqi national instructors, and interpreters.  The POB population will not exceed 1300 and the goal is to graduate 1200 cadets per cycle. (100 Officers/1100cadets)
 
The contractor will be responsible for securing Echo 1 on the An Numaniyah Training Base.  Echo is a self contained training area within a larger Iraqi military base and has internal fences and demarcated entry points.  In order to protect this area, the Guard force should consist of no less than seventy-five trained personnel.   Iraqi nationals provide force protection for most of the base, it is the responsibility of the offeror to coordinate with this force.
