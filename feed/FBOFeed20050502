<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) intends to award on a sole source basis,  a purchase order to J.E. Carlstrom Company of Chicago, Illinois for the following item: Four (4) each Gunn Oscillators, mechanically tuned WR-10, frequency range: 82-105 Ghz; power output: 40 mW minimum and output flange: WR-10. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) requires the use of these Gunn Oscillators for its Submillimeter Array, (SMA) local oscillator system. These oscillators are the heart of the local oscillator system for the SMA receivers.  We currently use three (3) WR-10 oscillators from J.E. Carlstrom and this purchase is intended to populate three (3) oscillator units for the 400 GHz receiver. These exact oscillators have been delivered and tested in the SMA lab and meet all required specifications. They are packaged into the SMA local Oscillator sub-system. Four (4) more are needed to complete the set of local oscillator units for the receivers and it is important that these oscillators come from the same source, so as to insure they are both physically compatible and interchangeable. A determination by SAO not to complete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SAO. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Delivery is sixty (60) days ARO.  This acquisition is being conducted under the guidelines as set forth in the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). No written solicitation will be issued for this requirement.  Anticipated award date is May 11, 2005

<SOLNBR>701815R035
<RESPDATE>060205
<ARCHDATE>05022006
<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurment to the University of Alaska Museum for the identification of wildlife carcases that resulted from the Seledang Ayu grounding in Cold Bay Alaska during the winter of 2004-2005. University of Alaska Museum will use their standard UAMX catalogue and its sequential numbering system for keeping track of each carcass with a complete description of remains (eg right wing, skin with contour feathers), its genetic sample, and associated pieces archived here as prepared & preserved morphological material and/or the remains returned to USFWS.  Due to physical degradation from predators in addition to oiling, it may not be possible to identify all remains to species. The goal is to make that number of unidentifiables as low as possible using reasonable methods of identification. As many as 50-70% of carcasses may be Aethia auklets which are less important than non-auklets for species-level identification, and a subsample of the auklets identified to species level may be sufficient. The UA Museum will use DNA 'barcoding' to identify some of these carcasses (see below). This first requires that we establish a vouchered 'reference panel' of genetic data for the species likely to have been impacted by the spill. The museum will use the standard 'barcoding' mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI), which has proven very useful for species-level identifications across many animals, including birds. 26 species were possibly affected by the spill, and the UAM bird collection has vouchered tissue samples of each of these. To accommodate genetic variation within each species UAM will sequence 5 vouchered individuals of each of these 26 species (130 birds total for the 'reference panel'). DNA 'barcoding' will be used to identify some of the physically degraded carcasses by comparing the DNA sequences of unknowns against the reference panel of known samples established in No. 6 above. Ruling out an identification can be as important as making a confident ID; this method should enable very high accuracy - likely in the great majority of cases to be 100% - for identifications of any sample containing amplifiable DNA. The UAM lab is routinely producing DNA sequence data, but the costs of identifying carcasses using this method is higher than using standard morphological techniques. Given that we do not yet know how many carcasses may warrant genetic identifications, it seems reasonable to propose here that UAM barcodes 192 individuals (equipment works in multiples of 16). If more sequencing is warranted, the contract may be modified support additional sequence-based identifications. As a museum with a bird research collection, UAM is an appropriate archive for Alaska bird specimens. Archiving a tissue sample for this project accomplishes two goals: 1) it enables anyone to go back to a carcass and identify it using genetic methods; and 2) it preserves a piece of each animal for future scientists to ask questions about these animals and the environments. All remaining material will be returned to USFWS. These materials would retain their unique number identifications. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 30 days after the publication of this notice.  See numbered Note 22.

<DESC>******************************************************************************* Correction to Response date. (Posted: 5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Change response date from "22 Jun 05" to "6 Jun 05" ******************************************************************************* Original Source Sought. (Posted:  5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Synopsis The Trainer Aircraft Systems Group (TASG), Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting a market survey of potential sources to provide both T-6A aircraft Sustaining Engineering support and follow-on Production of T-6A aircraft and related aircrew training devices (ATDs).  The TASG anticipates awarding a single contract for Sustaining Engineering support and follow-on Production Lots 14-20.   Background The JPATS is comprised of T-6A aircraft, T-6A ATDS, a Training Information Management System (TIMS), and courseware. Under the JPATS program, the T-6A aircraft is replacing the US Air Force (USAF) T-37B and US Navy (USN) T-34C trainer aircraft.  As a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the T-6A is a low- wing, high-performance, pressurized, turboprop trainer aircraft.  It is designed to take advantage of commercial aviation technology to meet US Government training system requirements.  Complementing the aircraft are five types of T-6A ATDs: an Operational Flight Trainer with a wide field-of-view visual system, an Instrument Flight Trainer with a narrow field-of-view visual system, a Unit Training Device with no visual system, an Escape System Trainer, and an Egress Procedures Trainer.  None of these ATDs are motion-based.  The JPATS will provide entry-level student pilots with the skills necessary to complete contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation!   missions during both day and night conditions.  Training in the JPATS will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.  Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), the JPATS prime contractor, began building the first T-6A aircraft for the US Government in 1996, and has been delivering these aircraft since 2000.  Under subcontract to RAC, the Flight Safety Services Corporation began building the first T-6A ATDs in 1998, and has been delivering them since 2000.  The T-6A aircraft and ATDs completed initial operational testing in 2002.  The USAF achieved its JPATS initial operational capability in 2002 and the USN followed in 2003. Current Environment Previously-awarded US Government production contracts have procured or provide options to procure 418 T-6A aircraft and 83 T-6A ATDs.  These JPATS assets will be deployed to USAF or USN training wings and squadrons at several different locations.  The T-6A aircraft will be supported by a separate Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services contract which is not part of this market survey. The contemplated follow-on Production contract will procure at least another 365 T-6A aircraft and 38 T-6A ATDs over the course of seven years, US Government fiscal years 2007-2013.  For seamless training operations, the additional T-6A aircraft and ATDs must be identical to those already produced.  In addition, the TASG needs to make several Class I engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs to remedy user-identified deficiencies, mitigate the discovery of obsolete parts, or adjust the performance of the aircraft and ATDs to match evolving user mission requiremen!  ts.  These Class I engineering changes will include changes to production configuration as well as retrofit of fielded assets.  Therefore, the TASG intends to procure Sustaining Engineering support as major part of the follow-on Production contract.  Potential sources are advised that Raytheon Aerospace Corporation (RAC) still owns design rights to the T-6A aircraft and peculiar support equipment.  RAC is currently the sole provider of studies, analysis, and Class I and II engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs.  RAC also provides all maintenance support for the US Government's prototype aircraft (PT-4), crash damage repairs to fielded aircraft, and system/sustaining engineering support of the entire JPATS Ground Based Training  System (GBTS): ATDs, TIMS, and courseware.     Contract Requirements 1. 7 lots of T-6A aircraft, at least 365 in total. 2. 7 lots of T-6A ATDs, at least 38 in total 3. Simulator Servers as required, to integrate the ATDs with the remainder of  the GBTS. 4. Future studies and analysis against aircraft and ground-based training  equipment deficiencies and product enhancements. 5. Maintenance support for the prototype (PT-4) aircraft located at RAC in  Wichita, KS. 6. Support for the development of new product enhancements for JPATS. 7. Crash damage repair as required for any fielded aircraft. 8. Onsite field service representatives at main operating bases to assist in  maintenance support. 9. Navy aircraft spares outside the typical COMBS Services contract  requirements. 10. Engine Structural Integrity Program and Aircraft Structural Integrity  Program support. 11. GBTS integration + systems engineering support. 12. Dedicated engineering support to address deficiency reports,  and  miscellaneous program management planning. 13. Incidental aircraft pilot training, GBTS user training, aircraft  maintenance training, and FIREFAM training. 14. Engineering changes to be cut-in to production aircraft and ATDs. 15. Retrofit of hardware or software changes on fielded assets. 16. Parts obsolescence management. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.

<DESC>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services 
The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the HVAC modernization of the existing Paul H. Findley Building-U.S. Courthouse in Springfield, IL.  The Paul H. Findley Federal Building- U.S. Courthouse, was constructed in 1929.  The three-story building provides 127,249 occupiable square feet.  The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as of 1978 and has a NR Rating of 3. The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-Construction Phase Services and a unilateral option for Construction Phase Services.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  The Government intends to evaluate price proposals according to the CMc’s cost of Pre-Construction Phase Services as the Base Contract and Construction Phase Services as an Option.  The Government contemplates the Option pricing will be broken down, for evaluation purposes, into prices corresponding to: Construction Phase Construction Management Services, General Construction, Profit, Overhead, Daily Delay Rate, Subcontractor Commission, and General Conditions. A firm, fixed-price based upon the general construction services required will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction Phase Option.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3).  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.  
Project Summary:  Selection of the CMc – type firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations, source selection procedures and the “Best Value Trade-Off” process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation. The HVAC modernization project will replace the existing failing and inefficient HVAC system in order to improve the basic level of functionality. Work items include replacing heating and cooling systems, temperature control/energy management system, piping systems, ceiling support of HVAC replacement, and the complete abatement of asbestos present in the structural fire proofing and pipe wrap affecting the alteration work.  The design is 95% complete and currently designed over budget.  The intent of this solicitation is to bring a CMc onto the team to evaluate the project and make suggestions to bring the project within budget.  The intent during preconstruction is for the CMc to review the sequencing, phasing, material purchase, individual phase timelines, swing moves, etc. to prepare a more realistic schedule and phasing plan.  The project will benefit from the CMc expertise in aligning the construction cost with a realistic schedule, bringing it within the project budget.  If the team is unsuccessful in bringing the project within budget, the construction option will not be exercised.
As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase, the CMc shall work with the A E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: evaluation of construction documents, reporting on progress, reviewing designs, developing a construction phasing plan, reviewing cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, develop subcontractor and supplier interest, keeping records, identifying problems or errors in the design and design documentation, resolving problems, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews and performing administrative and other services as defined in this scope of work, in addition to other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility.  For the Construction Phase of this project, the major work items include replacing heating and cooling systems, temperature control/energy management system, piping systems, ceiling support of HVAC replacement, and the complete abatement of asbestos present in the structural fire proofing and pipe wrap affecting the alteration work. Construction will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction process.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants. The building will be fully occupied during construction.  Construction will be accomplished with a combination of after normal business hour work (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays) and swing space. The US Attorneys are vacating the building prior to the project start opening approx. 3,000sf of swing space.  We will use this space in addition to other existing vacant space in the building to swing the tenants during construction.  The swing space will need some alterations to accommodate the various tenants’ operational needs.  The phasing plan will be required to include time to allow tenants to swing from their current space to a temporary location, and then back.  Existing furniture may need to be temporarily removed to accommodate construction.  
The Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA) range is $5 million to $5.2 million which does not include the preconstruction services.  The construction duration will be approximately 24 months. This duration does not include Pre-Construction Phase services (Base Contract). FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE BASE CONTRACT. 
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, constructabilty review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  review and evaluation of the construction documents for constructability, value engineering/cost savings suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, project schedule development, construction phasing plan development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest and identification of long-lead items, controlling schedules, keeping records, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.  
Proposal Submission Requirements:  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection Best Value Process.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board as well as pre-construction fees (base award) and a guaranteed maximum price for construction (option).

A “best value, trade-off” process will determine which offer is in the best interests of the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.

A competitive range of the most highly qualified firms will then be invited to deliver oral presentations for Stage II, Firms determined to be in the competitive range shall participate in an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, IL.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without holding discussions.

<DESC>The following is an INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT.  It constitutes the only written announcement.  Under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis an award of a contract using FAR Part 15 Negotiated Procurement Procedures to one source without full and open competition.  As justified below there are no other vendors who can provide the required expertise or have the knowledge base regarding the development and support of the National Environmental Information Exchange Network and the Central Data Exchange (CDX) to satisfy agency requirements within the required time frame for completion of the work.  Concurrent Technologies Corp (CTC) was a direct contributor to the "Blueprint for the National Environmental Information Exchange Network."  The company authored the chapter on data exchange templates and provided leadership on various technical aspects of the Network, including security and the use of XML.  CTC supported EPA in the development of CDX Node 1.0 project to build and stand up EPA's Node on the Network.  The CDX Node 1.0 went live in the 2003 and the current version 1.7.2 has successfully exchanged data with more than 25 state nodes.  CTC continues to provide node support to the CDX Node, as well as to the states in developing their nodes for the network.    The contract period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award and shall not include option periods.  The EPA seeks to improve participation in CDX among its constituent "small partners", specifically tribes and territories.  The goal of this project is to facilitate the exchange of environmental information from the small partners via CDX to enhance environmental management, policy and decision making.  This project will establish an independently managed technical and program center to expand the environmental information exchange of small partners in several ways.  In a pilot program, the contractor will conduct baseline assessment and analysis; develop outreach materials and outreach efforts; assist in planning and training required to successfully implement CDX network policies, guidance documents and automated tools for data collection; and program management support to tribes, territories and other small partners.   The Government knows of only one source, Concurrent Technologies Corp., 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-4193, capable of fulfilling the requirement.  The NAICS Code is 541513 with a Small Business Size Standard $18M.  The tasks to be performed include 1) Work Plan Development, 2) Project Status Meetings, 3) Baseline Assessment, 4) Analysis and Recommendation, 5) Node Pilot, 6) Planning for a Resource Center, 7) Program Support.  Direct all questions or inquiries by email to wade.valen@epa.gov NLT May 16, 2005.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to the National Academy of Social Insurance, 1773 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Suite 615, Washington, DC  20036-1904.  The National Academy of Social Insurance will provide estimates of workers’ compensation benefits paid out in 2003 by state.  Benefits will be broken down into medical and cash benefits.  For states where data is available, the amount of medical and cash benefits incurred by insurers for injuries or illnesses occurring in 2003 will also be provided. The incurred costs data will include not only benefits paid but reserves set aside for future. The National Academy of Social Insurance is a private nonprofit organization engaged in the collection and tabulation of social insurance information, including workers’ compensation data. Other government agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Social Security Administration rely on the National Academy workers’ compensation data for their research projects.  These data are currently unavailable from any other source. The data from the National Academy will be used to update the National and State Health Accounts, and has served as an important element of the historical "sources of funds" estimates for the National Health Accounts.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) is in the process of a confirmation study of promising molecular profiles in stage I lung adenocarcinomas.  The study is supported by the Director’s Challenge program which developed molecular profiles that identify a subset of stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients who are risk of a poor disease outcome.  CDP staff initiated a large multi-institutional study to confirm the potential clinical utility of these molecular profiles.  Microarray analysis of 600 new Stage I lung adenocarcinomas was carried out at four academic analytical sites, the analyses were carried out under a standard protocol and the microarray data has been submitted to NCI for analysis.  The clinical data for the 600 samples will be submitted to CALGB Biostatistics Center who will collect the clinical data from the four participating sites, curate the data and have it QCed.  It is mandatory that all required data is submitted and accurately represented, therefore the CALGB will ensure all required data elements are submitted and follow-up with the investigators submitting the data if additional data is needed.  This will ensure that the specimens analyzed will be annotated with high quality, reliable clinical data.  Once the curation is completed, the data will be released to the NCI caArray website where it will be combined with the microarray data for analysis. The CALGB biostatistical center was involved in the planning and the initial lung study and a subset of the samples were supplied by CALGB.  The CALGB Biostatistical Center already has a portion of the clinical data associated with specimens used in the study since that data was collected on clinical trials carried out by CALGB.    They are familiar with the details of the lung study which will ensure the timely and effective assemble of the critical clinical data associated with the lung specimens.   Continuity of this on-going study is crucial to the clinical trials and CALGB Biostatistics Center, is the only known source. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 17, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Prospectus will be issued May 10, 2005, for a 70-day response period under the terms described in the Prospectus, with proposals due on July 20, 2005, no later than 4:00 p.m.  Any offer, including that of the existing concessioner, must be received by the Concessions Program Manager, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, CA 94607 by this date in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of the concession contract.

<DESC>******************************************************************************* Correction to Response date. (Posted: 5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Change response date from "22 Jun 05" to "6 Jun 05" ******************************************************************************* Original Source Sought. (Posted:  5-2-05) ******************************************************************************* Synopsis The Trainer Aircraft Systems Group (TASG), Joint Primary Aircraft Training  System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is conducting a market survey  of potential sources to provide both T-6A aircraft Sustaining Engineering  support and follow-on Production of T-6A aircraft and related aircrew training  devices (ATDs).  The TASG anticipates awarding a single contract for Sustaining  Engineering support and follow-on Production Lots 14-20.   Background The JPATS is comprised of T-6A aircraft, T-6A ATDS, a Training Information  Management System (TIMS), and courseware. Under the JPATS program, the T-6A  aircraft is replacing the US Air Force (USAF) T-37B and US Navy (USN) T-34C  trainer aircraft.  As a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the T-6A is a low- wing, high-performance, pressurized, turboprop trainer aircraft.  It is  designed to take advantage of commercial aviation technology to meet US  Government training system requirements.  Complementing the aircraft are five  types of T-6A ATDs: an Operational Flight Trainer with a wide field-of-view  visual system, an Instrument Flight Trainer with a narrow field-of-view visual  system, a Unit Training Device with no visual system, an Escape System Trainer,  and an Egress Procedures Trainer.  None of these ATDs are motion-based.  The  JPATS will provide entry-level student pilots with the skills necessary to  complete contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and navigation  missions during both day and night conditions.  Training in the JPATS will lead  to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one of the USAF or USN  advanced pilot training tracks.  Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), the JPATS  prime contractor, began building the first T-6A aircraft for the US Government  in 1996, and has been delivering these aircraft since 2000.  Under subcontract  to RAC, the Flight Safety Services Corporation began building the first T-6A  ATDs in 1998, and has been delivering them since 2000.  The T-6A aircraft and  ATDs completed initial operational testing in 2002.  The USAF achieved its  JPATS initial operational capability in 2002 and the USN followed in 2003. Current Environment Previously-awarded US Government production contracts have procured or provide  options to procure 418 T-6A aircraft and 83 T-6A ATDs.  These JPATS assets will  be deployed to USAF or USN training wings and squadrons at several different  locations.  The T-6A aircraft will be supported by a separate Contractor  Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) services contract which is not part  of this market survey. The contemplated follow-on Production contract will  procure at least another 365 T-6A aircraft and 38 T-6A ATDs over the course of  seven years, US Government fiscal years 2007-2013.  For seamless training  operations, the additional T-6A aircraft and ATDs must be identical to those  already produced.  In addition, the TASG needs to make several Class I  engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and ATDs to remedy user-identified  deficiencies, mitigate the discovery of obsolete parts, or adjust the  performance of the aircraft and ATDs to match evolving user mission  requirements.  These Class I engineering changes will include changes to  production configuration as well as retrofit of fielded assets.  Therefore, the  TASG intends to procure Sustaining Engineering support as major part of the  follow-on Production contract.  Potential sources are advised that Raytheon  Aerospace Corporation (RAC) still owns design rights to the T-6A aircraft and  peculiar support equipment.  RAC is currently the sole provider of studies,  analysis, and Class I and II engineering changes to the T-6A aircraft and  ATDs.  RAC also provides all maintenance support for the US Government’s  prototype aircraft (PT-4), crash damage repairs to fielded aircraft, and  system/sustaining engineering support of the entire JPATS Ground Based Training  System (GBTS): ATDs, TIMS, and courseware.     Contract Requirements 1. 7 lots of T-6A aircraft, at least 365 in total. 2. 7 lots of T-6A ATDs, at least 38 in total 3. Simulator Servers as required, to integrate the ATDs with the remainder of  the GBTS. 4. Future studies and analysis against aircraft and ground-based training  equipment deficiencies and product enhancements. 5. Maintenance support for the prototype (PT-4) aircraft located at RAC in  Wichita, KS. 6. Support for the development of new product enhancements for JPATS. 7. Crash damage repair as required for any fielded aircraft. 8. Onsite field service representatives at main operating bases to assist in  maintenance support. 9. Navy aircraft spares outside the typical COMBS Services contract  requirements. 10. Engine Structural Integrity Program and Aircraft Structural Integrity  Program support. 11. GBTS integration + systems engineering support. 12. Dedicated engineering support to address deficiency reports,  and  miscellaneous program management planning. 13. Incidental aircraft pilot training, GBTS user training, aircraft  maintenance training, and FIREFAM training. 14. Engineering changes to be cut-in to production aircraft and ATDs. 15. Retrofit of hardware or software changes on fielded assets. 16. Parts obsolescence management. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to  determine the availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms  responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business,  HUBZone small business, and/or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.   The North American Industrial Classification System Code 336411, Aircraft  Manufacturing, applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,500  employees.  All potential sources must be registered in the Central Contractor  Registration database to be awarded a DoD contract.  Interested firms are  encouraged to first register as a potential source on the PIXS Web Site  (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  PLEASE INFORM US IF YOUR FIRM INTENDS TO  PERFORM THE WORK SOLELY OR IF YOU DESIRE TO SUBCONTRACT WITH THE PRIME  CONTRACTOR. Technical Considerations In addition to the information requested above, interested firms should also  submit sufficient information to permit evaluation and qualification of their  technical capabilities.  The TASG will be assessing the level of market  interest and competitiveness for this acquisition based on responses to the  following: 1. Does your firm have knowledge of the entire T-6A aircraft?

Clarification to the SESS Solicitation’s Attachment 1, Contractor Past  Performance Information; Attachment 2, Government POC Questionnaire for RFP;  and Attachment 6, Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter On Letterhead Labeled “For  Official Use Only” . Atch 1 is for the offeror to complete in total and submit to the Government as  Vol V of your proposal. Atch 2 is for the offeror to complete, sections A through E only; send the  entire attachment to the government point of contact (POC) you are requesting  input from, and the government POC will complete the attachment and send  directly to NASIC.   As stated in the instructions to the offerors, Sections A through E were to be  submitted with Vol V.  It was not noted however, that this information would  not count against your page count.  Should you need to revise you input, a  list of your government POCs along with the program titles will suffice.     Submittal information can be found in Sec L, para 2.2(b). Atch 6 is just a sample letter for the offeror’s use to transmit the  questionnaire at Atch 2.

<DESC>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR VARIOUS MULTI-DISCIPLINE PROJECTS PRIMARILY IN THE STATE OF MAINE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM 330.
Engineering and design services are required for an indefinite quantity contract, N62472-05-R-6514, for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the state of ME.  

The NAICS Code is 541310 and the small business size standard classification is $4,000,000.  The proposed contract is considered for 100% small business set-aside.       

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $100,000 - $5M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 – 35%, 35 – 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the “Success” estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.

<DESC>The United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) mission is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global C4ISR and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. USSTRATCOM’s Acquisition and Contract Management Division (USSTRATCOM/J81) is responsible for acquisition management and planning for all USSTRATCOM computer systems supporting HQs Automated Data Processing (ADP), war planning, and command and control missions.  USSTRATCOM/J81 and the 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base conducted a Command and Control information briefing on 9 November 2004.  The purpose of the briefing was twofold; it provided the vision of the USSTRATCOM C2 program, acquisition, and contracting approach.  Also included were descriptions of current C2 projects and a discussion of the portfolio of contracts used by the C2 program.  The second purpose was to offer DoD contractors the opportunity to provide feedback on the Government’s future acquisition and contracting plans.  Since the 9 November 2004 industry briefing, USSTRATCOM acquisition planning has progressed with much feedback received from the contractor community.  The purpose of this information notice is to provide an update on USSTRATCOM’s Command and Control (C2) acquisition strategy.  Included is an update to the C2 Information briefing that provides status of requirements currently on the Computing Environment STRATCOM Architecture (CESAR) contract that ends on 30 September 2005.  The final update to this briefing, detailing how USSTRATCOM will align requirements to different contract vehicles, is expected to be posted to FEDBIZOPS by the end of April 2005.

WDTC is currently fully certified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001-2000 Quality Management System.  WDTC is fully committed to this standard and continues working to stay fully compliant with the standard.  This requires maintaining extensive oversight of the overall WDTC quality system.  Because documents are one of WDTCs primary products, quality controls in the development of each document are critical to WDTCs success as an industry leader.  It is imperative that WDT C effectively control all documents associated with our testing environment.  Standing Operating Procedures (SOP), Test Operations Procedures (TOP), Division manuals, work instructions and all other test related documents must be secured and kept up to dat e.  The ultimate contract will require the Contractor to play a significant role in the management of all WDTC controlled documents.  The Contractor must have demonstrated experience in ISO 9001-2000 Quality Management Systems and an ability to manage docu mentation under the ISO 9000 standard. This requirement is set-aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is  541710 (500 employees).  This is cost plus fixed fee solicitation for one (1) base period of five (5) years, a first option term of three (3) years, and a second option term o f two (2) years for a potential maximum contract length of ten (10) years. The solicitation will be available on or around 4 MAY 2005 through the Armys Single Face to Industry website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ and through the U.S. Army Contracting Agency  Dugway Proving Ground website at https://www.dugway.army.mil/ CONTRACTING/procurement/solicitations.htm (NOTE: When accessing either the ASFI or the Dugway Proving Ground website, make sure the address begins with https not http to gain access to the secure web server).

<DESC>TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING ACQUISITION SUPPORT 5 (TEAS 5).  Sources are sought to provide Advisory and Assistance (A&AS) manpower support services in a variety of engineering, technical and acquisition management disciplines for the Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB FL, Hurlburt Field FL, Holloman AFB NM, Kirtland AFB NM, Air Logistics Centers, and other related locations as required.  The AAC was created in October 1998 to provide a single focal point within the USAF for air armament.  AAC develops, acquires, tests, deploys, and sustains air-delivered munitions.  TEAS 5 will provide professional engineering services to support that mission.  The anticipated contract type is a cost-plus-award-fee with miscellaneous cost reimbursable line items.  The current ceiling level of performance is 875 man-years.  Final decision for the acquisition strategy will be made by the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Combat and Mission Support (AFPEO/CM).  Any potential small business set-asides will be considered within the requirements of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710, size standard of 1000 people.  Foreign participation is excluded.  The TEAS contractor must evaluate the designs and products of AAC’s prime systems contractors.  To ensure full access to those designs and products, the TEAS contractor must not be a competitor of the prime contractors which build air armament systems for AAC.  The TEAS contractor will not be allowed to bid on any other AAC contract, unless a waiver is granted by the TEAS Contracting Officer.  The intent is to utilize unique private sector engineering expertise with demonstrated experience in the area of air-delivered armament to enhance the Air Force's capability to accomplish munitions development and acquisition programs.  Interested sources who feel they can meet the requirement should provide a statement of capabilities that provides the following information related to their demonstrated experience and capability in the area of air-delivered armament:  a)  Potential offerors are to have demonstrated successful experience providing air armament engineering services.  Provide contract information and/or other program information describing your experience in the last ten years relative to air-delivered armament systems.

<CONTACT>Marc G. MacKeigan Contracting Officer 2022083923     marc_g_mackeigan@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The United States Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition & Property Management Division, on behalf of the Department's International Technical Assistance Program ("ITAP"), intends to award on a sole source basis a firm fixed-price contract to Wildlife Conservation Society of New York, NY for the following services: 1) Combat fires within the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the Peten Region of Guatemala with particular concern for Laguna del Tigre, the Laguna del Tigre-Mirador Biological Corridor, community forest concessions in the center of the Maya Biosphere (Ruta Carmelita), Sierra del Lacandon National Park, and Yaxha National Park. Fires are currently burning and pose a threat to these areas. 2) The contractor will work with the Guatemalan National Park Service ("CONAP") to strenthen its abilities to prevent fire outbreaks and improve response capabilities and effectiveness. 3) Contractor will work to strengthen the communications network of the Maya Biosphere Reserve with CONAP. These services are required immediately as fires have been burning since March 2005. Funding is provided by the US Agency for International Development. Services are estimated to be needed from May 6, 2005 through August 15, 2005. DOI requires a contractor with a strong working knowledge of the biological and cultural landscape of the Peten region of Guatemala and with a functioning infrastructure already in place in Guatemala. Furthermore, it requires a contractor with wide experience with managing fire prevention and control under difficult conditions that include fire setting by drug traffickers, human traffickers, illegal poachers onto park lands, and illegal wildlife and timber poachers. It is a further enhancement that the contractor be a current strategic partner of CONAP working under a cooperative agreement and is a strategic partner of IDAEH, the Guatemalan Archaeological Management Agency. This requirement is much more that fire fighting and prevention; it is imperative that the contractor understands and appreciates the cultural and wildlife resources that are at risk and how they are to be protected. Based upon information available to it at this time, and as required at FAR Part 6.302, the Government believes that only Wildlife Conservation Society ("WCS") can perform these services and in a timely (emergency) manner. However, if additional sources should be identified, they will be considered. Firms that feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response by no later than 12:00 noon local time in Washington, DC, on Wednesday May 4, 2005. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

management oversight and direction for all programs and
appropriations.

The NAS Bogota Management unit controls a current $460
million budget that grows to approximately $900 million
when prior year funding (pipeline) is included, and exceeds
$1 billion when other agency funding is added; to support
the execution, logistical and administrative support of
Colombia counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs,
which includes twenty five programs and eight multi-year
appropriations.

STATEMENT OF WORK

A.   The Financial Management Advisor has primary
responsibility for providing management oversight and
direction for the twenty-five programs and eight multi-year
appropriations, which make up the NAS Colombia counter-
narcotics and law enforcement programs;

B.   Direct supervision and development of the sixteen
locally hired staff supporting the financial management
function;

C.   Provide funds availability verification and payment
processing to vendors, contractors and employees for all
goods and services related to the support of program
operations;

D.   Prepare periodic financial reports of activities for

E.   Execution of allotments in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations to ensure that funding and
expenditures are promptly and accurately recorded;

H.   Monitor changing program priorities and identify
funding to support the changes;

I.   Performs periodic reviews of obligations and un-

available balances.  Results of process will also be used
to perform the annual certification of obligations report;

J.   Perform review and approval for all voucher payments
in support of program operations; and

K.   Perform procedural reviews of financial procedures
with the intent of finding opportunities to enhance
efficiency and effectiveness.

Continuing duties and responsibilities include:

A.   Coordinating the development of internal control and 
improper payment reviews to ensure that NAS Bogot's
financial operations are in compliance with applicable
laws, regulations, policies and agreements. Articulate
these laws, regulations, policies and agreements to all NAS
program staff and GOC entities;

B.   Providing direction and support in planning,
developing and administering a comprehensive program of
financial management support services to NAS Bogot counter-
narcotics and law enforcement programs; including direct
collaboration with GOC entities supporting counter-
narcotics and anticrime programs in Colombia;

C.   Preparing periodic financial reports to post
management officials and selected GOC principles. Reports

the requirements of laws and regulations, and established
policies;

D.   Providing technical support and training to program
managers to assist them in administering their individual
programs;

E.   Reviewing existing and proposed legislation and
regulations related to programs carried out or financed by
INL in order to make recommendations on their impact on the
economy and efficiency of the administration of these
programs or the prevention and detection of crime, fraud,
waste, and abuse in these programs;

F.   Collaborating with NAS management offering
contributions with respect to the development of a wide
range of effective strategies to help monitor counter-

support funding requests submitted to INL/RM for
Congressional approval; and

G.   Coordinating initiatives across agencies within the
USG and GOC entities on the broad range of issues under
which counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs
operate.

SUPERVISION

A.  The Financial Management Advisor will receive general
guidance and direction from the NAS Administrative
Management Officer.  As a recognized expert in the
financial and organizational management field on programs
and issues, the contractor will receive administrative and
policy direction on program priorities and objectives.
Specific assignments frequently originate out of the
liaison activities of the work, and the contractor will
independently negotiate the scope and objectives of tasks
with little input from the supervisor;

B. The contractor will supervise two Budget Analysts, five
Accountants and nine Voucher Examiners who provide funding
and payment function support for the counter-narcotics and
law enforcement programs of NAS Bogot.

GUIDELINES

A.   Guidelines include basic legislation, in particular
Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as well as
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Other laws, including other
authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts,
the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control
Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of
the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and
Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates
funds for the INL programs), other supplemental
appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic
Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the
programs for which INL has responsibility;

B.   In addition, broad agency policy statements for the
program may include reference to pertinent legislative
history. The Financial Management Advisor must exercise
considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing
precedents and in developing new or improved approaches in
analyzing controversial and nationally important subjects
to persons with conflicting views. The incumbent is
recognized as an expert in the development and
interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational
management issues.

COMPLEXITY

The work involves planning, organizing, and completing 
financial and organizational analysis of enormous
complexity. Frequently due to the high visibility and
political sensitivity related to operational challenges of
providing timely logistical support to counter-narcotics
initiatives one is forced to be more re-active than pro-
active in support efforts.  Discerning the intent of
legislation and policy statements and determining how to
apply them in a unique field of operations not likely
envisioned by crafters of the legislation or policy
statements when created, offer unique and demanding
challenges.

SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS

The Financial Management Advisor performs very broad and
extensive assignments related to a complex
administrative/financial program, approximating $1 billion,
in Colombia.  The counter-narcotics law enforcement program
has significant impact on the USG and GOC joint efforts to
succeed in the war on drugs and law enforcement. The
incumbent will perform duties in a hazardous environment
where 15% danger pay is authorized.

PERSONAL CONTACTS

The incumbent works closely with NAS senior management, GOC
military and police officials, Embassy administrative
management staff and INL/RM on the full spectrum of issues
related to counter-narcotics and law enforcement program
financial management administrative support in Colombia.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

A.  U.S. citizen, subject to State Department Secret level
security clearance;

B.  Bachelor's degree in Business Administration or
Equivalent in years of experience;

C.   Spanish language ability at the Foreign Service

D.  Ten years of progressively relevant USG experience in
management, supervision and government accounting;

E.  Must have experience working with the full range of
administrative laws, policies, regulations, and precedents
applicable to the administration of one or more important
public programs;

F.   Must have the ability to project and analyze the
potential effects of budgetary actions on program viability
and attainment of program objectives as NAS Bogot's
financial authority on the application of existing
policies, laws and regulations to ensure timely logistical
and operational support; and

G.   Must have expert knowledge of applicable legislation,
statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures in order to
develop policy documents, audit reports, and other
materials requiring in depth expertise in financial theory,
techniques, and methodologies. This requires the ability to
ensure implementation of internal control reviews improper
payment reviews, and Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND ALL INFORMATION WILL BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED BASED ON YOUR RESPONSES NOR WILL THERE BE ANY REIMBURSEMENT ISSUED FOR THE  PREPARATION OF ANY SUCH RESPONSE.  ALL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SHOULD BE MARKED AS SUCH.  THIS IS STRICTLY A MARKET SURVEY/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SEEKING POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR PRODUCTION OF PROPHET BLOCK II. System Description: Prophet is the principal ground-based brigade tactical SIGINT/EW (Electronic Warfare) system. Prophet Control (PC), mounted on a HMMWV, tasks Blocks I and II. Prophet Block I is mounted on a separate HMMWV to provide SIGINT capabilities.  Prophet Block II is planned to be on a standard TACOM-approved trailer pulled by Block I or a separate HMMWV.  It is intended to be a replacement for the TLQ-17A(V)3 tactical EA systems with expanded capability in regard to power, frequency coverage, and jamming versatilit y. Stand-off jamming using a mast-mounted, directional, high-gain antenna in a stationary configuration is a Block II Key Performance Parameter (KPP). An on-the-move (OTM) jamming (EA) capability with an omni-directional antenna is highly desired.   Minimu m power amplifier output may vary from 200 Watts for the VHF band to 50 Watts into the UHF band. The Block II trailer-mounted EA system will be self-contained with its own power supply generator and controls, and be able to be connected to Block I for cont rol in co-located or short-distance remoted operations. Prophet is modular and can be tailored to perform special missions by the Technology Insertion (TI) of Special Purpose EA. The purpose of this Market Survey is to identify sources for production of Prophet Block II that are capable of meeting the Governments requirement for a mature COTS end-to-end system with little or no non-recurring engineering. The Block II/III System De sign and Development (SDD) contractor is General-Dynamics Decision Systems, Scottsdale, AZ 85252-1417, Cage Code 1VPW8, with the major subcontractor for EA being Rockwell-Collins (Cedar Rapids, IA.)  Production for Block II is not a fabrication of the SDD item, which was a combined Block II/III system on a single HMMWV platform.   Scope of Effort for which Information is Requested: The Governments initial requirement for Prophet Block II calls for the acquisition of 33 Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Block II systems starting with approximately 21 in FY05.  A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated. The LRIP contract award  date is projected for 31 June 2005. First Article Testing (FAT) on the LRIP systems must be completed prior to delivery of the first LRIP units in March 2006. The planned contract shall include requirements for complete supportability and logistical tasks such as providing Technical Manuals, maintenance concepts and demonstration, test plans, calibration plans, etc.  Note:  this announcement is only a Market Sur vey and prospective offerors are not required to provide detailed plans for supportability and logistics at this time, but respondents should describe their ability to do so. Requested Response: Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Suppliers capable of furnishing these units must do so in writing. The response should be a short introductory description of a viable approach meeting the a bove needs. There should be some technical description of the proposed subsystem/technologies to include configuration and capabilities and how this will meet the anticipated requirement.  Additional documentation such as test results, product descriptions , previous performance, may be appended.  Respondents must address to what extent they would be able to demonstrate a full end-to-end pre-production system by June 2005. Submit one (1) set paper copy and one (1) electronic copy (on CD-ROM) of the initial s ubmission to the f ollowing: Commander, US Army Communications Electronics Command Acquisition Center ATTN: AMSEL-AC-CC-RT-GN (ATTN: Cynthia Geiss) Building 1208 West Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703 Submit one (1) set paper copy and one (1) electronic copy (on CD-ROM) to the following: Project Manager Signals Warfare Product Manager Prophet ATTN: -SFAE-IEWS-SG (ATTN: Mark Conrad) Building 288, Sherrill Ave. Ft.

<SUBJECT>R -- Enhancement of Small Area Analysis Methods and Tools for Environmental Public Health Tracking
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates awarding a sole source contract to Imperial College of Science, Technology & Medicine of London, England, for the enhancement of small area analysis methods and tools for environmental public health tracking.  Reports of potentially raised rates of disease around environmental sources or in specific areas can cause great public anxiety and need to be handled efficiently and effectively by the authorities concerned. A common part of the response to such reports is to use routinely collected statistics to establish whether rates of the disease are higher than would be expected based on the population at risk and on a reference set of rates. The UK Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) was developed by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) of Imperial College London in order to speed up this resource intensive part of the investigation process.  The RIF is able to rapidly generate rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age and year ranges, for any given geographical area.  It also produces unsmoothed and smoothed maps of relative risks, together with maps showing the demographic, socio-economic, environmental and geographical characteristics of the area.  The RIF currently supports health and geo-spatial datasets developed by the SAHSU specific to the country of Great Britain.  However, the functionality of the RIF holds great promise for use in a wide variety of projects that involve evaluating the spatial and temporal relationships between environmentally related diseases and environmental hazards.  The Contractor shall, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the personnel, facilities, materials and supplies necessary to examine the feasibility of adapting the Rapid Inquire Facility (RIF), a GIS-based analytical information system developed by the Small Area Statistics Unit of the Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, London, England, for use in the NEPHTN, and to conduct activities that further enhance the analytic capability of the RIF and the NEPHTN to detect potential aberrations in disease and exposure through small area analyses.  CDC will retain ownership of data developed under the contract.  The Government knows of only one qualified source capable of providing the required services.  This is not a request for proposals.  Interested parties shall submit in writing: their name, address, point of contact, and telephone number.  Interested parties shall also submit a brief capability statement indicating their capabilities to perform this service.  This information shall be submitted in writing, or faxed to (770) 488-2688, or emailed to sdolan@cdc.gov.  Documentation should be received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the CDC.  A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discrection of the Government.

<SUBJECT>D -- Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID2006)
<DESC>1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID 2006), scheduled for 30 May through 23 June 2006.  Combatant Commands, Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, and international participants must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2006 by 30 September 2005.  Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2006, to include the format and submission instructions for interoperability trials (ITs), can be found at http://www.cwid.js.mil. 

2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the C/S/As and the international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), is responsible for the oversight of the CWID event.  The intent of CWID is to conduct ITs that include C4ISR technologies that are capable of being responsibly placed into an operational environment within 6-12 months following the execution phase. ITs are not limited to hardware and/or software solution assessments. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technologies are just as important as the IT solutions themselves.  Further investigation into these areas using CWID as a vehicle is highly encouraged. The USJFCOM J6, in collaboration with J8, J9, Joint System Integration Command, and the USJFCOM Office of Prototyping Oversight, will review and consider the results of the CWID event in an effort to identify those solutions that could be responsibly fielded or endorsed to the Joint Staff J6 for referral to an existing program of record.

3. United States European Command (USEUCOM) is the host Combatant Command (COCOM) for CWID 2006.  Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2006 will reflect a more traditional military-to-military and military-to-civil authority focus on exercising its Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) responsibilities in an international setting.  United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) intends to continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating systems integration and interoperability solutions in the Home Land Security/Home Land Defense (HLS/HLD) arena. 

USEUCOM intends to use CWID as a risk reduction venue and proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to the GWOT.  Coalition participation and the demonstration of interoperable C4ISR systems remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations.  In coordination with, and the approval of, the Joint Staff J-6, each COCOM may sponsor and invite individual nations from within their respective area of- responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 

4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide a context for validation of C4ISR solutions.  Depending on the capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution, each IT may receive one or more of the following assessments based on the criteria set forth in the CWID 2006 Additional Information document:  Warfighter/Operator, Technical/ Interoperability, Security Capabilities assessment, and a Fielding/Sustainability Assessment.  The Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG), with input from other working groups, will report on those trials, which are not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).  Results from all trials will be detailed in the CWID Final Report.  ITs with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network, Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO.  The use of other information domains to support diverse communities of interest and their information flow requirements is influenced by the participating nations and government agencies and approved by the CWID Senior Management Group.  

5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2006, each proposed IT must:  address one or more of the CWID 2006 objectives listed in paragraph 7, commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for one or more execution locations, be submitted in concert with a DoD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DoD in the format outlined on the CWID web site. 

6.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with coalition partners, will select specific IT proposals for execution by 7 November 2005 based on projected availability of resources, how well the IT satisfies one or more of the CWID objectives.  USEUCOM will provide an initial determination on those ITs related to the GWOT. 

7. USJFCOM, in coordination with the Joint Staff, DISA, NSA, JITC, the Services and USEUCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2006 from the COCOM capability gaps highlighted in their collective integrated priority lists.  A summary of the five specific CWID 2006 objectives follows:

CWID 2006 Overarching Objectives and Explanations

Overview:      

The event objectives, form the foundation for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID), and are driven by the overarching need to share and exchange information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies.  The traditional view of coalitions focused on military-to-military interaction; however, it now incorporates a variety of international organizations that include military and civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the continuing need for unimpeded information sharing between legacy and new technologies as well as tactical exchanges between emerging coalition partners, civilian agencies and civil authorities/first responders.  By streamlining command and control capabilities, we improve our senior leadership’s ability to respond to GWOT contingencies.  The multi-national and interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military-to-military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards and protocols for both hardware and software.  

Coalition operations, in response to international crises, continue to highlight the requirement to seamlessly exchange command, control, computer, communication, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and logistical information.  The acceptance and endorsement of the Network Centric Warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in current operations, points to the need to resolve the associated technical, procedural and policy challenges. 

The CWID event provides a unique opportunity for U.S. Combatant Commanders, Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) organizations and traditional international coalitions to explore innovative information sharing and interoperability solutions.  CWID 2006 continues this successful tradition by providing a venue aimed at thoroughly integrating solutions while focusing on network centricity, and investigating tactics, techniques and procedures. 
The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct and leverage the advantages of emerging technology.  During the CWID execution phase, Interoperability Trial (IT) activities will be conducted over, or connected to, a world wide area network that supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the military’s role in providing Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA).  CWID ITs are executed within the context of an overarching scenario to demonstrate how coalition warfighting and civil interagency operations can benefit from emerging technologies.

The CWID 2006 Objectives described below contain several key differences from those associated with past Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations.  First, the number of objectives has been reduced to narrow the focus of the annual event and to reflect a recurring theme of “Coalition Information Sharing.”  Second, each objective is supported by “sub-objectives” that reference clearly defined U.S. Combatant Commander and Coalition capability gaps.  Finally, each “sub-objective” is related to the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) to highlight a stronger relationship with warfighter requirements through a more defined mission-to-task linkage (specific UJTL references available upon request).  These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing solutions to the warfighters.

Objective 1: Coalition Command & Control (C2).  Enhance the Commander’s Coalition C2 capability through secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive technologies, within and between communities of interest (COIs) and information domains of differing security classifications.  

-	create a cohesive C2 relationship with and between military, coalition 
      and non-military activities        
-    improve open and secure mobile C2 capabilities between COIs 
-    streamline operational decision-making for GWOT contingencies 
Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be mobile, fixed or remotely located where the combination of military and/or civil agencies is likely to be affected by limited bandwidth.  Within any COI, mission success relates to the commander’s C2 ability to communicate directly with individual users who may be detached from fixed information domains.  Decision makers and/or first responders require interoperable, reliable and/or secure wireless capabilities to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the Network Centric warfare construct.  Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.  

Objective 2: Coalition Information Sharing.  Provide solutions that improve the Commander’s ability to share information within a multi-lingual coalition that is secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive.   Included in this objective are improvements to language translation tools that provide grammatically correct, militarily appropriate context, multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration within and between disparate information domains.  

-     multi-level and multi-domain security 
-	improve utility, accuracy and language capacity of translation tools 
      (French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Russian) 
o	written-to-voice, visa versa
o	voice-to-voice 
o	user friendly displays 
Explanation: Coalition information sharing is more than providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare.  Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context.  Possible information to exchange includes: directive commentary, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence related products.   A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains.  Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language.  A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current translation tools include inadequate vocabularies for limited languages and typically do not provide grammatically correct or militarily relevant translations.  Additionally, no translation tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages. Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and extract specific data sets while providing reliable language translations for communicating guidance to coalition partners. 

Objective 3:  Integrated Logistics.  Provide solutions for responsive, effective logistics within and between multiple information communities of interest (COIs).
- 	develop the ability to assess and display information on the movement, location and status of US and coalition partners’ equipment and personnel en route and/or deployed 
-	improve logistics data access, fusion and integration among COIs 

Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition, military and non-military operations, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics.  Logistic data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

Objective 4: Continuity of Operations.  Provide C2 solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to plan, communicate and affect coalition operations while remotely deployed.   Inherent in this objective is the ability of the commander to maintain situational awareness and connectivity with subordinate activities while en route to the theater in crisis. 

-	enhance Commander’s ability to rapidly deploy a joint force     
      headquarters 

Explanation: Commanders are challenged to sustain their situational awareness once they depart on their assigned mission.  Trial proposals must be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Possible information requirements include: friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence-related information.  When appropriate, the solution must be scaleable to provide GIS and Global Command and Control System (GCCS) situational awareness information to non-military, federal, state and local participants via a protected, multi-lingual and secure network, common to all.  Information exchange should support pre-event and en route planning as well as the situational awareness during the execution of operations.  At a higher level, this objective involves effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, or conversion of data from one format to another, identification of producers/ consumers of information, and how to transmit the information securely from end-to-end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to creating and sustaining effective situational awareness is users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains, while operating within a bandwidth-constrained architecture.  Additionally, the integrity and continuity of sharing common information across networks must be preserved.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, data standardization and / or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable to information sharing, data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.

Objective5: Net Centric Enterprise Services.  Provide solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to collaborate and disseminate information among communities of interest (COIs) in a Net Centric environment.  

-	improve information assurance
-	improve horizontal data access, fusion and integration 
-	improve vertical and horizontal information distribution

Explanation:  Network Centric Enterprise Services imply that coalition, military and non-military civilian authorities can harness the power of their respective information environments to collaboratively plan and execute operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment.  Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare.  Operations require an information environment that is not only scaleable, but one that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and it is likely they will be bandwidth-constrained. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants.  Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.

<SUBJECT>R -- Increase the ceiling of the On-Site Inspection Directorate (OS) Program Support
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to increase the ceiling of the On-Site Inspection Directorate (OS) Program Support Contract DTRA01-02-D-0064 with CSC Systems & Solutions, LLC, 6101 Stevenson Ave., Alexandria, VA  22304.  This is an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract.  The contract ordering period, which ends 28 Feb 08 with an additional six months to complete performance, will remain unchanged.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling to accommodate an increase in current requirements, primarily the unanticipated increase in support for the International Counterproliferation (ICP) Program.  The ICP Program provides training and equipment to border, customs and law enforcement personnel of participating countries to counter the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related materials.  Training requests and program events have significantly increased since 2001.  The additional efforts for the ICP Program and for other OS programs are of the same type and nature currently being performed and are within the scope of the original contract statement of objectives.  An increase in the contract ceiling will provide for continued critical support during the original contract period of performance.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation at this time would incur substantial duplication of costs during a lengthy transition period that would not be recovered through competition.  The Government has also determined that a lengthy transition at this time would cause delivery delays and jeopardize program execution.  This action will be executed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A competitive follow-on acquisition is planned in the future based on the current contract expiration date.  Responses to this notice of intent to increase the current contract ceiling may be submitted within ten (10) days of publication of this notice; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this action at this time based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>ARMY TRANSFORMATION PROGRAM INFORMATION: The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will be holding One Industry and Technical Forum in Washington DC with the Modular Building and Pre-Fabricated Construction Industries in order to perform market research  on possible future Request(s) for Proposal(s) that may be issued in support of the Military Construction Program.  USACE is looking to hold this Forum with those firms that design, fabricate, construct/erect, fit and finish modular and pre-fabricated buil dings (tilt up concrete, metal/steel, or wood factory fabricated buildings, etc.) as USACE sees this type of facility construction as one of multiple possible solutions to our multibillion dollar construction program requirements for the Army. This Construction Program will consist of Multiple Facilities for the Army (Barracks, Operations Buildings (company, battalion and brigade level) Tactical Equipment Shops, General Instruction Buildings, and Dining Facilities) as well as multiple facilities  for the Families (Child Development Centers, Fitness Facilities, etc.) to support the Army Transformation.  The overall program will involve numerous installations throughout the U.S. and Alaska and Hawaii over the next few years.  (The Installations Will  Not Be Identified Until After BRAC 2005).   The Primary Objectives for this Program are Acquisition and Construction Processes that: "	Minimize cost "	Radically reduce total project lead time "	Radically reduce construction duration - minimize time to beneficial occupancy date "	Identify and implement improved processes/procedures/specifications and practices "	Assure facility functionality life spans are of a quality to last 25 years  "	Optimize maintenance and maintenance costs balancing desired outcomes "	Optimize procurement approach(es) balancing desired outcomes USACE will be seeking input, at a minimum into the following concerns: "	Identify what benefits the Modular and Pre-Fabricated Industries will bring the Government "	Determine if there are particular facilities that these Industries produce and construct better than others "	Identify how these buildings are procured, constructed and maintained when they are used Commercial Construction projects "	Ensure that the requirements for Force Protection and Progressive Collapse are possible "	Determine the most effective type(s) of contracts for these types of facilities, including possible incentives that would help to achieve Army objectives  "	Determine how to capitalize on economies of scale, standardization, and cost efficiencies associated with local performance "	Determine the technical, management, and cost issues that could serve as quality discriminators among proposals for consideration in developing the evaluation factors to be included in the RFPs "	Determine cost and time impacts on potential offerors of various levels and types of information that could be requested from offerors by the Government in the RFPs INFORMATION GATHERED RELATIVE TO THIS PROGRAM WILL PERMIT ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE METHOD(S) OF PROCUREMENT AND INPUT IS DESIRED FROM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES  THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTORS, INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS OR SOCIETIES.

<SUBJECT>--Analysis of samples for biological defense agents using Affymetrix microarray technology.
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Gene Logic, Inc., 610 Professional Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20879.  The procurement will provide the U.S. Army Medical Research Instit ute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) with the Quality Control, processing, labeling, gene expression data generation, and data analysis (identification of candidate biomarkers based on significantly changing genes, if any, in the samples that would differ entiate responses between experimental groups treated with vaccine or infectious agent) of samples to be delivered and prepared by USAMRIID using a protocol suitable for use in Affymetrix microarray technology. The contractor must have the ability to predict toxicity of compounds based on a well defined set of biomarkers for toxicity.  It is believed that Gene Logic, Inc. is the only company with a library to detect changes with virus-like-particles of Ebola/Marb urg and other biological agents and vaccines.  The contractor must be able to screen biomarkers for specificity and cross reactivity against an extensive pre-existing database to allow quick elimination of biomarkers that could also be expressed in other c ommon disease conditions and thus lead to false positives.  For example, a biomarker for exposure to Anthrax may also be expressed in patients with pulmonary emphysema.  It would be necessary to know of such co-occurrences to minimize the number of false p ositives when screening large populations for exposure to biological agents.  It is believed that Gene Logic, Inc. uniquely offers the breadth and depth of data necessary for screening biomarkers for this level of specificity. Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient  detail to demonstrate the company's ability to meet the requirement.  Information can be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: Mary.Rico@amedd.army.mil.  The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses received fro m responsible businesses prior to close of business on 17 May 2005 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. Relative weight.  Non-price factors (Security, Technical and Past Performance), when combined, are more important than price.  Of the non-price factors, security, is more important than technical and past performance.  Technical is more important than past performance. The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase as the relative differences in non-price factors of offerors decreases.  The highest possible rating is Excellent, with the lowest possible rating being unacceptable.
(1) Security.  The Security Factor consists of the subfactors listed below.  These factors will be evaluated on a "Pass/Fail " basis. Subfactors are listed in descending order of importance. (i) Each offeror and its  employees must possess a current (U.S.) TS/SCI security clearance. Offerors must provide proof of security clearance status. (ii) The Government shall evaluate each Offeror’s ability to provide TS/SCI cleared personnel consistent with the Government's timing needs. (2)  Technical.  The Technical Factor consists of the subfactors listed below. Subfactors are listed in descending order of importance. (i) The Government shall evaluate each Offeror’s ability to conduct research and analysis of complex terrorist organizations, activities and networks in the Mid-East region. (ii)The Government shall evaluate each Offeror’s knowledge and understanding of methodologies and techniques associated with evaluating terrorist organization and network capabilities and identifying vulnerabilities. (iii)The Government shall evaluate each Offeror’s ability to prepare complex analytic intelligence products, with a focus on events, networks, and groups in the Middle East. (iv)The Government shall evaluate each Offeror’s evidence that they have devoted a maximum level of effort to the task in terms of man-hours and specialized expertise.  (3)  Past Performance.  The Past Performance factor will be used to determine the risk of non-performance, defective performance, and/or late performance by evaluating each Offeror’s reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of services being solicited.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided by the offeror and may contact other sources of information.  The Government may evaluate the past performance of the Offeror’s proposed key subcontractors, predecessor companies, or key personnel who have relevant experience to the extent warranted.  Only relevant experience will be considered for past performance purposes.  An offeror with no record of relevant past performance will be given a "neutral" rating for past performance.  To assess reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of product and services being solicited, the offerors shall submit at least three (3) sources, and include a POC name, phone number, contract number (if appropriate) and brief description of position. (4)  Cost/Price. This factor will evaluate the cost quotation to determine price analysis, price reasonableness, and price realism of the proposed total evaluated price.(e)  A definition of the evaluation ratings is as follows: Excellent - The Contractor's proposal provides evidence that the Government can expect superior performance of the tasks and deliverables listed in the Statement of Work, with minimal risk of substandard performance.  An excellent rating indicates that the proposal contains significant strengths and few or no weaknesses.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for SimLab Simulation Participants for a total of 5 years (base period of one-year with four one-year options).  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price Delivery Orders. BACKGROUND: NASA Ames Research Center’s Simulation facilities, jointly called “SimLabs,” support a wide range of research with emphasis on aerospace vehicles, aerospace systems and operations, aviation human factors and air transportation system safety and capacity.  For more information please see: www.simlabs.arc.nasa.gov.  SimLabs consists of flight simulators and air traffic control simulators.  The flight simulators are: The Crew Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF) B747-400 Simulator; The Crew Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF) Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator; The Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS). The air traffic control simulators are: FutureFlight Central (FFC); The Crew Vehicle Systems Research Facility (CVSRF) Air Traffic Control (ATC) Lab. CVSRF consists of two full motion flight simulators and an ATC Laboratory.  The three can be operated individually or integrated. The purpose of the facility is to study safety and technical innovations individually, or as they affect the pilot/controller working relationship.  Typical CVSRF flight simulation experiments involve scenarios designed to look at specific questions regarding pilot/flight deck interface or pilot/controller interface.  There may be several runs per day or one real time flight profile.	The typical study will last one to two weeks. Typical CVSRF pilot and controller needs vary.  Flight crews have normally been one crew (2 pilots) per day; however there have been studies that have required up to 5 crews per day for up to a week. ATC controller and pseudo-pilot requirements vary from zero to eight. The VMS is a high fidelity motion-base flight simulator capable of simulating a wide range of aerospace vehicle.  No requirement for simulation participants for the VMS is anticipated.   FFC is a full-scale air traffic control tower simulator dedicated to solving the present and emerging air traffic capacity and safety problem of the nation’s airports.	Typical FFC control tower simulations involve preparing a graphical model of an airport layout and vicinity, several traffic exercise scenarios, and conducting full traffic operations with certified controllers and pseudo-pilots pilots.  Four to 25 pseudo-pilots control the aircraft in real-time and communicate verbally with the controllers.  Training is conducted three days per week for three to five weeks to familiarize the pseudo-pilots with the proficient operations of aircraft in the simulation airport.  Two to six air traffic controllers are also required to conduct the pseudo-pilot training.  The actual experiment normally runs for approximately one week.  SimLabs customers are researchers from NASA, other government civil or military agencies, or private companies.  Simulation experiments are conducted based on customer demand, which is not uniform throughout the year.  Therefore NASA requires access to simulation participants whose schedules are flexible.   WORK TO BE PERFORMED: Simulation participants are needed to support human-in-the-loop real-time simulation.  They include certified pilots, pseudo-pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs).  The Contractor shall provide these pilots and controllers on a temporary, as needed basis to support experiments on-site in SimLabs facilities.  They shall recruit, hire, schedule, and complete visitor badging authorization for all simulation Participants.  An understanding of the general requirements for typical research conducted with SimLabs is highly desirable.  All Participants must be United States citizens and speak English fluently.   Specific simulation participant requirements: a.	Flight Simulator Pilots: i.	Commercial Pilot with Instrument rating, Airline Transport Pilot Rating (ATP) is highly desirable; ii.	“Glass cockpit” and Flight Management System (FMS) experience is required; iii.	Large aircraft experience is required (eg. Regional Jets to Boeing 747 and 777). b.	Simulation (pseudo) Pilots: i.	Previous pilot’s license, either commercial or private, is highly desirable; ii.	Familiarity with large complex airport operations is desirable; iii.	Basic familiarity with communication protocols between pilots and controller is desirable; iv.	Ability to multi-task and keep track of many usual and verbal cues simultaneously is required; v.	Ability to communicate and work as a team in the pseudo-pilot room is required. c.	Simulation Air Traffic Controllers: i.	Must have previous certification in the type of facility for which they are needed (tower, Terminal Radar Area Control (TRACON), or Center); ii.	For tower controllers, previous experiences at a large complex airport are desirable.   ANTICIPATED NEED: a.	Flight Simulator Pilots: Year 1 number of participants and total number of hours are 40 and 1600, respectively.	For years 2-5 number of participants and total number of hours per year are 60 and 2400 respectively. b.

<DESC>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) operating the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is interested in developing a qualified source list of companies for the preparation of independent, complete, cost estimates for the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of four buildings on its Richland campus and potentially two on its Sequim campus, the interior areas of which may have been contaminated by radionuclides during research and development activities.

These cost estimates are needed for future planning, scheduling and budget requests.  Any resulting contract will be limited to the preparation of estimates only; no actual D&D activities are presently anticipated nor funded.  Note that the successful offeror for this project will not be excluded from submitting a proposal on the actual D&D work, should it ultimately be funded.  On the other hand, firms which can produce sound cost estimates, but do not necessarily have the staff or interest to perform the actual D&D activities, are also welcome to respond to this RFQ.

Thorough and precise cost estimates will be prepared that address and describe all aspects of the D&D activities necessary for the eventual free release of certain Battelle facilities and the termination of Battelle’s existing Washington State Department of Health (DOH)-issued Radioactive Materials License.  Cost estimates will include all of those activities needed for the facilities’ free release as well as those corollary activities such as physical demolition and low-level waste disposal.   All radiation surveys, building materials sampling, radionuclide analyses, and other work elements are to be in accordance with the Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM).  

The successful Contractor must exhibit a proven and demonstrable track record regarding cost estimating for D&D activities using MARSSIM.

In an effort to develop a qualified source list for the solicitation, and in addition to a detailed description of the company, résumés must be provided for all persons actually working on the project and any person identified in the proposal must be either locally accessible or readily accessible via teleconference and able to travel to Richland for specified tasks.

This RFQ does not obligate Battelle to pay costs incurred in the preparation and submission of the requested information, nor to enter into a contract or other arrangement with the Offeror.

Interested respondents may respond electronically to me at rick.dennis@pnl.gov or via regular mail  addressed to:  

		Battelle-Pacific Northwest Division
		P.O. Box 999
		Richland, WA 99352
		Attn: R. D. Dennis, Mail Stop J2-05
 
Email and envelopes containing the desired information should be submitted to me as soon as possible, but in sufficient time to be received by Battelle no later than 4:00 P.M. local time, May 16, 2005.

If you have any questions regarding this RFQ, please contact me at (509) 373-5894.

RE: Questions & Answers - 

1.      What is your current property management system?
	
	The NSF Property Tracking System is a client server application developed in-house with PowerBuilder, a Sybase product.
	
2.	Will the existing data need to be transferred into the new system? If so, what format will that data be received?
	
	Existing data would need to be transferred.  NSF's system integrators will be able to convert this data in accordance with the vendor's specifications.
	
3.	Of the 250 users defined in the solicitation, please define how many users will require full time access to the system, how many will require frequent part-time access, etc. 
	
	Full-time access 100 
	Frequent access 150
	
4.	Please define the types of assets to be managed by the system, i.e., personal assets (computer equipment, etc.) or fixed assets (lab equipment, etc.)
	
	Personal assets
	Real property (land, buildings)
	Fixed assets
	
5.	PROP5 - Can you elaborate on NSF’s current Financial Accounting System and the ability to interface with other systems? What level of integration is NSF expecting? Is the data getting pulled or pushed from our technology?


The system shall provide support for a service oriented architecture (SOA) and should be easily integrated with current/new systems. The system shall integrate with NSF’s Financial Accounting System (FAS) to deliver updated property information.  The system shall interoperate and communicate with NSF's current/new Procurement Management systems.

NSF’s Financial Accounting System (FAS) is a custom-developed system used for all accounting within NSF.  It currently provides remote Java APIs and Sybase Stored Procedures as integration options.  A web service interface could be developed to support communication with a SOA-enabled property management solution.

NSF expects the property management system to be able to push financial information to FAS for at least asset depreciation, asset addition, transfer, and asset retirement. This data would include the owning NSF organization unit, asset value, and NSF accounting codes to track the asset type and vendor information.

The Property Management system must also interface with NSF’s Procurement system.  Selection of a new system is underway so the interface options are not yet defined.  Similar interface requirements also apply to that tool selection.

The need to push/pull data from FAS and Procurement will also be dependent on the approach used to synchronize NSF accounting codes, organizations, vendors, and similar information between the three systems.
	
6.	PROP13 - Is NSF currently utilizing RFID technology?  If so, please explain the environment, i.e., tag and integrator technology.  In addition please describe the amount of and type of data stored or to be stored on the RFID tags.
	
	No RFID currently in use.
	
7.	PROP13 - Is NSF currently utilizing barcode technology?  If so, please explain the environment, i.e., barcode and integrator technology.  In addition please describe the amount of and type of data used.
	
	Pre-printed barcode labels are used. Barcode scanners can be used as needed for inventory purposes. In previous inventories barcode reader technology was provided by contractor service.
	
8.	TECH1 - What versions of the Sun Solaris will be supported? Will this system be on new or existing infrastructure? If existing, please describe your current architecture.

	NSF hosts most of its business application on Sun Solaris, and strongly prefers to continue this.  The infrastructure consists clusters of Sun v440 and v240 machines currently running Solaris 9, as well as Sun Java Enterprise System for application server, directory, portal, web server, etc.

Excerpt from:

National Science Foundation (NSF) Consolidated Procedures and Standards Volume I: Management - Client/Server dated June 23, 2004
….
	5.2.	Policies and Standards
All systems development/acquisition projects must follow these major steps and the management review process described below. Exceptions can be made with the prior approval of the Director of DIS.
1.	The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 superseded Public Law 100-235; The Computer Security Act of 1987, there is no longer a statutory provision to allow for agencies to waive mandatory Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The waiver provision had been included in the Computer Security Act of 1987; however, FISMA supercedes that Act. Therefore, the references to the "waiver process" contained in many of the FIPS are no longer operative. 

2.	The project manager must conduct a risk-based analysis to assess the scope and magnitude of risks associated with the information system, and to use as a aid to develop and implement steps required to mitigate, or else to accept those risks.  A threat and vulnerability analysis examines the potential source(s) of damage to the system, the nature of the damage that they might cause, and estimates the impact on the mission of the damage due to abuse, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information or degradation of performance related to the system.  It also evaluates the effectiveness of systems security controls in providing protection against exploitation of vulnerabilities.  The process consists of:  identifying all sensitive hardware, software, and data, their vulnerabilities, and potential threat sources; determining the magnitude of damage, an estimate of the probability of occurrence, determining the rough cost of each security control; and identifying cost-effective protective measures for mitigation.  
3.	A threat and vulnerability analysis is a document that permits management to make informed decisions relating to implementation of cost-effective computer security measures.  The threat and vulnerability analysis must take place in the requirements definition phase of the life cycle.  Management must review this report and must determine if the remaining unmitigated level of risk is acceptable to them.  
4.	The threat and vulnerability analysis must take place at the following times:
·	Prior to approval of security requirements specifications for new major systems and their supporting general support systems
·	When a significant change occurs to the system
·	At least every three years
5.	An application threat and vulnerability analysis must be conducted by the project manager and focuses on the application-specific technical and operational (procedural) security control techniques, the interface between the operating system’s security controls and the application’s security controls, and the threat sources inherent in the operating environment.
6.	All sensitive systems must control and limit user access based on the identification and authentication of the user, and discretionary access control mechanisms.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission team to explore a request by the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport) for assistance with the expansion of two of its main ports: the Port of Walvis Bay and the Port of Lüderitz.  With projected growth in the container, mining, energy, and secondary service sectors, Namport expects to exceed its current capacity by 2007.  The company considers these ports’ expansions critical to the ports’ own sustainability and to Namibia’s continued economic growth.  
International trade and economic development in Southern Africa has increased Namibia’s role in the overall trading scheme, in part because of investments made by the Government of Namibia and its neighboring governments in transport and related services that created access to Namibia’s ports.  Namport now sees its mission as extending to serve the needs of the supply chain throughout the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region.  The port projects need to expand facilities by 2007 to handle the increased traffic.

For the Port of Walvis Bay, Namport envisions capturing increased trans-shipment services, and believes that it will need to increase the water depth and build a new container terminal and landside quayside areas in order to do so.  For the Port of Lüderitz, the company expects to require infrastructure to accommodate the development of Namibia’s offshore gas resources in the Kudu gas field, set to proceed by 2008.

Namport is a parastatal company that has been in operation for ten years.  The company handles more than 2.4 million metric tons of cargo annually and has been profitable for the last several years.  The definitional mission consultant will further evaluate the company’s operations and ability to proceed with its expansion plans as proposed.  

The definitional mission consultant will travel to Namibia to evaluate port sector opportunities for USTDA funding, with a focus on Namport’s request for USTDA consideration for a feasibility study for port expansion and development for the Ports of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz.  The consultant will assess all pertinent USTDA criteria to make his/her recommendation, and will provide USTDA with a full Terms of Reference and budget for each recommended project.

 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.
