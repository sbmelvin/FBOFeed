<SUBJECT>B--Variability in Abundance of Arctic Cisco in the Colville River:  Analysis of Patterns and Existing Data
<SOLNBR>1435-01-04-RP-34979
<RESPDATE>072204
<ARCHDATE>07072005
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. The UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "VARIABILITY IN ABUNDANCE OF ARCTIC CISCO IN THE COLVILLE RIVER: ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS AND EXISTING DATA". The NAICS code is 541710 and the small business standard is 500 EMPLOYEES. The MMS intends to competitively award a contract to meet specific study objectives. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT: The government estimates a period of performance for this contract will be eighteen months and a cost range of $283,000 to $315,000. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Fall fishing under the ice of the Colville River for Arctic cisco is considered an important part of Inupiat culture and is a vital subsistence harvest for the village of Nuiqsut. Native Alaskans are concerned that Arctic cisco in the Colville River have been less abundant during the last few years than in the years preceding oil and gas development. At a 2003 workshop in Nuiqsut to review existing knowledge and identify major questions, it became evident that much could be gained from a multidisciplinary exploration of existing data sets before commencing with further field data collection. This exploration of existing data could answer many questions and will more precisely delineate need for additional data. This study will use existing data to gain further understanding of the observed trends in Arctic cisco abundance and estimate what factors influence population variation. Study information is essential for implementing sale stipulations and permit regulations and for evaluating offshore oil and gas exploration in this area. GOAL: The goal of this study is to gain understanding of the natural and human factors affecting abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River and to evaluate need for any further field work. OBJECTIVES and methods include: 1. Gather existing appropriate biotic and abiotic multidisciplinary data relevant to Colville River Arctic cisco abundance. 2. Explore data patterns and relationships in the data. 3. Conduct in as much detail as possible appropriate statistical analyses and inferential hypothesis testing of the following general null hypotheses: (a) Changes in oceanographic or hydrographic processes do not significantly change abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River. (b) Variations in natural history characteristics do not change the abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River. (c) Ecological processes do not change the abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River. (d) Existing data are not sufficient to detect effects due to human activities. 4. Conduct sensitivity analysis of variables. 5. Synthesize and quantify the relative importance of natural and human activity on the variability of Arctic cisco populations in the Colville River. 6. Identify data gaps and priorities for acquisition of new data as appropriate. SCOPE OF WORK: TASK 1-DATA COLLECTION. The contractor shall acquire pertinent existing qualitative and quantitative data that can be used to test the hypotheses in the Objectives about biotic and abiotic factors that may play an interactive role with offshore oil and gas development in the variability of Arctic cisco abundance in the Colville River. Compilation of the most pertinent existing data and development of appropriate hypotheses are expected to require a multidisciplinary approach. Data types and hypotheses shall be discussed and an interdisciplinary consensus reached as to their appropriateness and testability. An appropriate relational database compatible with MMS Machine Readable and GIS formats shall contain the data, shall be able to incorporate new data that may be acquired in the future, and shall have a data manual describing the structure and format and providing appropriate instructions. Data shall be documented with metadata that identifies sources, limitations, and permissions. An electronic copy of the data shall accompany the final report. TASK 2-VALIDATE INTERPRETATIONS. The vehicle to implement the validation shall be a panel of approximately five to ten local experts or key informants to create a dialogue that flows between the panel and the contractor throughout the period of the contract. The panel of formal, informal and influential experts will be selected by a process that ensures objectivity and credibility in identifying key informants. The panel should be especially active in both the data exploration and hypothesis testing tasks. The contractor shall also coordinate with ongoing studies to minimize demands on the local community and shall be responsible for arranging meeting logistics. The panel shall meet at least once each during data exploration and hypothesis testing, as well as at other times if appropriate. At each meeting, the contractor shall present the results of the task to date. The contractor shall provide the panel with an orientation to complex visual exploration and statistical diagrams. Through the panel, the contractor shall maximize the use of traditional knowledge and expertise of local residents familiar with Arctic cisco and the local environment to validate the Contractors interpretation. The expert panel shall review plausibility and credibility of emerging patterns and interpretations, and provide recommendations on the variables and data analysis to the Program Manager. The panel will provide feed back on the plausibility of hypothesized relationships based on local familiarity with the resource and environment, help identify alternative explanations not readily apparent to the scientists, and suggest additional factors that could help to improve the interpretations and choice of variables in the statistical analyses. Minutes of the expert panel's meetings and an independent panel final report shall be included in the project deliverables. TASK 3-DATA EXPLORATION. The contractor shall explore the potential to test specific hypotheses (generated from the general null hypotheses above) with data compiled in Task 1. The contractor shall use multivariate visualization software for viewing and exploring high dimensional data to explore patterns and features of the relationships between biotic and abiotic factors that may contribute to the variability in abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River. Data shall be systematically explored for relations between variables. The contractor shall identify testable hypotheses that are plausible or credible to scientific experts, as well as other relationships identified in the visual exploration and present these to the panel of local experts as described in Task 2. TASK 4-HYPOTHESIS TESTING. The contractor will further refine and statistically test the specific hypotheses that were derived in Task 3, and that use the recommendations of the panel in Task 2, to identify the relationships of apparent importance to the abundance of Arctic cisco. The contractor shall use inferential statistical data analysis to test these hypotheses taking into account robustness of statistical methods relative to the quantity and quality of the existing data and the resulting power of discrimination. The contractor shall evaluate levels of uncertainty in inputs and outputs in preparation for sensitivity analysis in Task 5 below. The extent to which variability caused by human activities can be evaluated shall be specifically addressed. The contractor shall describe key analyses and relationships in text and also depict them as plainly as possible in appropriate graphs, diagrams, and maps usable by both scientists and the general public. The results and interpretations of the statistical tests shall be presented to the local expert panel described in Task 2 for their feedback. TASK 5-SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS. The Contractor shall evaluate the sensitivity of the variables to quantify how much a given change or error in an input variable changes the results of calculations or simulations. This analysis shall be a major component of the study which will also help to identify data gaps and delineate recommendations for prioritizing acquisition of new data. TASK 6-SYNTHESIS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS. The final report shall synthesize the results of analyzing all the available data, present conclusions pertinent to hypothesis testing, identify data gaps, and make pertinent recommendations regarding further research, and shall consider the input of the expert panel. At a minimum the final report will present and discuss: - A discussion of data gaps, problems or limitations of the data and the effects of these on the analyses-  .An explanation for the relational scheme of the data and metadata of the original sources. - What key relationships (hypotheses) were perceived in the exploratory phase, especially new or unexpected relationships. -What relationships (hypotheses) proved significant in statistical tests. - A discussion of robustness; power of the analyses; the uncertainty, and sensitivity of the input and output parameters; and the relative importance of variables analyzed during the study. - How the input of the panel was considered in the hypothesis development and testing. - What new understandings were derived through the analysis. - A discussion of the relationships that the simulation, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses suggest are the priority data collection and research topics to pursue to deepen our understanding of the variability in abundance of Arctic cisco in the Colville River. - An evaluation of what relationships are most relevant to MMS offshore oil and gas lease activities and how the conclusions may have potential application to future MMS NEPA analyses. - A bibliography, including metadata for data sets and relevant literature cited, input into a ProCite database with appropriate keywords. Copies of papers or other references cited that are less than 30 pages are also to be provided separately in .PDF format. - A discussion by the Contractor of the process of validation by the panel of experts. It shall include a summary of activities and recommendations or inputs by the local panel at each stage, a discussion of where the Contractor felt the Panel's input was most valuable, the strengths and weaknesses the Contractor perceived in the process, and the Contractor's recommendations for future use of this type of input. The discussion shall be attached as an appendix. - The expert panel's independent final report shall discuss the same topics as the item above from the panel's perspective. The expert panel's independent report and minutes from the panel meetings shall be attached as appendices to the Contractor's final report. -Final data manual with metadata, sources, limitations, description of structure and formats and appropriate instructions for future users shall be attached as an appendix to the Contractor's final report. TASK 7-PROJECT MANAGEMENT The project management plan shall incorporate methods to ensure multidisciplinary and cross-cultural integration throughout all phases of the project. The management plan shall address efficient commitment of personnel and resources and anticipated problems and solutions. The Contractor shall also arrange to present the findings of the Revised Final Report to MMS staff and key stakeholders.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number DE-RQ26-04NT400624 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This requirement is being issued as a Request for Quotation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The following items are to be purchased by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory  (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA and is to be shipped to our site located in Albany, OR.  Items to be purchased are two (2) Creep/Stress-Rupture Systems with the following salient characteristics and specifications for the purchase of the brand name or equal equipment.  Award will be made to the low priced, technically acceptable (equal) offeror.  Equality shall be determined by the offered equipment?s compliance with the following performance requirements.  Compliance will be determined by the offeror?s provision of literature showing performance capabilities or through written narrative discussing the points not covered by the published literature. Specifications for Two (2) Creep / Stress-Rupture Systems The purpose of this specification is to procure two creep / stress-rupture systems to augment the existing equipment.  An overriding consideration is that the systems must fit within the dimensions of the floor space available. The machines are located in the corner of a lab where space is constrained by access to another lab through inward swinging double-doors and an aisle on the other side to yet a different lab.  Traffic in and out of both labs requires that the creep frames be enclosed on three sides and arranged in a U-shape facing away from traffic to minimize disturbances to the furnaces and transducers.  Each system must consist of an enclosed load frame, a furnace, a controller, an extensometer, and a transducer.  The transducers must interface with the existing National Instruments FieldPoint data acquisition system. The new systems will complement one ATS 2240 and three ArcWeld M3 testers. The creep and stress-rupture work is being done in support of materials for use in power plants and other energy-related applications.  The research requires accurate determination of creep rate, steady state creep, and activation energy as well as the more traditional time-to-rupture.  The specifications listed below constitute the minimum requirements for this system.  A total of two (2) systems, each consisting of a load frame, furnace, furnace controller, extensometer, transducer, and signal conditioner, will be purchased. Creep/Stress-Rupture Specifications 1.0 Load Frame 1.1 The load frames will be placed side-by-side in a U-shaped configuration with three ArcWeld M3 machines.  The total maximum width available for the two frames in this configuration is 60.5 inches (the width of each machine must be approximately 30 inches).  The maximum depth of either frame is 24 inches. All frames, furnaces, weights, motors, and peripherals must be contained within the 60.5?x24? footprint.  Height is not an issue.  The frames must be free-standing. 1.2 The load frame should be enclosed on the back and both sides.  All loading/unloading must occur from the front of the machine. 1.3 All controls, specimen loading and parts that may need service must be accessible from the front of the machine so that the load frames may be permanently located side-by-side and back to the wall. 1.4 Each load frame shall have a capacity of at least 3000 lbs and should have a calibrated range from 10% to 100% of the machine rate capacity. 1.5 Loading should be accomplished by a lever arm.  The lever arm must have an adjustable counter balance for nulling the load train mass. 1.6 Some method must be provided for precision adjustment of the lever arm ratio. 1.7 The lever arm should rest on hard knife edges. 1.8 The lever arm must have overtravel protection. 1.9 The frame must have adjustable feet and be provided with vibration isolation for the feet. 1.10 A mechanism must be available for sensing when the sample has failed. This mechanism must stop the timer and cut power to the furnace. 1.11 A drawhead must be provided that automatically adjusts during the test to compensate for specimen elongation so that the lever arm is kept relatively level. 1.12 Drawhead motor must have stable continuous motion so that vibration is not transferred to the specimen and anti-rotation properties so that torque is not introduced. 1.13 Loading system must include weight load pan, quick-change adapters that provide load train alignment to minimize bending, and all adapters necessary to connect to the existing Albany Research Center ¾? x 10 UNC high temperature pull rods. 1.14 Weights and high temperature pull rods will be supplied by the Albany Research Center. 1.15 Machine controls must include manual drawhead up, manual drawhead down, and automatic control; test time module with manual start/stop switch; counter with 99,999.99 hour capacity; mounting for LVDT signal conditioner; and mounting for furnace controller. 2.0       Furnace and Controls 2.1 Furnace should be of the split tube design with three zone configuration where each zone can be adjusted independently with an independent controller.

<DESC>Description: SUBJECT:  Engineering, Design, Modeling, Fabrication, and Training for Operation of Two Unique Gas Fired Furnaces DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Enercon Inc, Elyria, OH for the following work to be completed at our site U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, Albany, OR.. PROJECT OBJECTIVE:  Engineering, design, modeling, fabrication, and training for operation of two, unique gas fired, regenerative/conventional burners, gas trains, and controls for installation on two unique new aluminu8m melting and/or refractory furnaces and the retrofit on the Experimental Reverbratory Furnace located in Building 34, Albany Research Center, Albany, Or.. TASK #1.  Design two gas burner systems to include the capability to exchange conventional and regenerative gas burners on an existing and new aluminum melting furnace. TASK #2.  Perform computational fluid dynamics modeling of burner system geometry to include both conventional and regenerative burners. TASK #3.  Furnish all necessary burners, controllers, mass flow controllers, gas train valving, regulators metering, manual air and gas balancing apparatus, cabling, regenerative burners, piping for the new, round top aluminum melting furnace, for retrofit of regenerative burners for the ERF, and for the gas train for the new 3200 degree F refractory furnace. TASK #4.  On-site training in the operation of the systems.. This purchase order is being issued the Enercon Inc because it is uniquely capable of performing this objective which entails the engineering of two gas burner systems to include the burners, gas trains, and controls for two furnaces and the retrofitting of the capability of a regenerative burner system to replace the conventional burners, when desired, on an existing furnace. Enercon Inc has been instrumental in the past in providing unique, gas-fired equipment for this area to include a truly unique thermal oxidizer; a hot blast (air preheating system) that will be the art of the new regenerative burner system; the design and engineering of our state-of-the-art air pollution control system for this building; and the design and modeling of the current burner system for the ERF.  All of this work and the apparatus associated with it is very complex and will have to be designed to be assimilated into the current aluminum melting capability in Building 34.  Not only will the system have to be designed to fit the current and proposed furnaces, but the burner systems will have to be modeled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the components will have to be procured from a number of dissimilar sources and carefully engineered to fit both the existing systems and the two new furnaces.  Because of the research nature of these furnaces, the systems will have to be designed to work efficiently using both conventional burners, but it will be necessary to, with an absolute minimum amount of work, to convert the two aluminum melters to use a set of regenerative burners.  This requires specialized knowledge of the existing systems, CFD, engineering design, and the capabilities needed for the new melting and curing furnaces.  The only entity with this unique capability is Enercon Inc.  It is believed, that no other company would be able to do this work without undertaking a long, and steep learning curve.  Completion of this system is critical to the completions of milestones on for different Center projects. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Paul Turner, Phone 541-967-5863.

This solicitation number DE-RQ26-04NT400623 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This requirement is being issued as a Request for Quotation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The following items are to be purchased by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA and is to be shipped to our site located in Albany, OR.  Item to be purchased is an Electro-Mechanical Test System for Mechanical Testing of Metals and Ceramics with the following salient characteristics and specifications.  Award will be made to the low priced, technically acceptable (equal) offeror. Equality shall be determined by the offered equipment?s compliance with the following performance requirements.  Compliance will be determined by the offeror?s provision of literature showing performance capabilities or through written narrative discussing the points not covered by the published literature. Specification for Electro-Mechanical Test System for Mechanical Testing of Metals and Ceramics The purpose of this specification is to procure an electromechanical (screw-drive) test system for the primary purpose of quasi-static tensile and compression testing of metals.  The control system should not be limited to static testing, but should also be capable of running simple fully reversed, tension-tension, or compression-compression fatigue tests.  The Albany Research Center conducts research in support of the Nation?s energy needs.  Current research needs span the range from slow strain rate tests to strain rate change tests to strain rate sensitivity assessment to 1200C compression tests. Slow and fast crosshead rates, high data collection rates, and true strain control are all required features of the new system. The new system will complement the 25kN capacity Instron 1123 with 5800 retrofit.  As such, it is necessary that the current grips and extensometers be accommodated by the new system.  Sufficient horizontal working space between the columns and vertical working space between the crosshead and base is necessary to accommodate the existing 1000C split tube furnace and the 1600C split refractories furnace, sequentially.  The specifications listed below constitute the minimum requirements for this system. Materials Test System Specifications 1.0 Load Frame 1.1 The load frame proposed shall have a capacity of at least +/-20,000 lbs and no more than +/- 30,000 lbs.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center is seeking qualified sources that have the capability and expertise to perform the overhaul or core exchange of York International Inc air conditioning compressors and marine air conditioning condenser (condenser originally manufactured by Dunham Bush, Inc).  These items are required for the support of the 378’ WHEC and 270’ WMEC class cutters air conditioning systems.  All work or core exchange shall be performed in accordance with York International (OEM) specifications and standards, utilizing only genuine York International replacement parts.  The compressors and condenser that will be included on this intended acquisition are: (1) Stock Number 4130-01-487-5141, Compressor Part Number JE421, estimated quantity of 2 per year; (2) National Stock Number 4130-01-269-0125, Compressor Part Number SS63C, estimated quantity of 4 per year; (3) National Stock Number 4130-01-114-4487, Compressor Part Number SS62B, estimated quantity of 2 per year; and (4) National Stock Number 4130-01-492-5250, Condenser Part Number CDRM1237A2L, estimated quantity of 2 per year.  Contractor shall be required to provide all labor, materials required to open, inspect, report, repair, test, preserve, and package all compressors and condenser in accordance with current OEM specifications and standards.  The Coast Guard intends to award a firm fixed requirements contract for a base year and four option years.  Technical, engineering data and drawings to successfully overhaul or provide a core exchange of both the compressors and condenser are proprietary information, and are not available to the Government.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining full and open competition, as the technical and engineering data required to successfully perform the work is only available from one source, York International and its subsidiaries.  It is the Government’s belief that only York International and its subsidiaries possess the capabilities to repair in accordance with OEM requirements to ensure the proper form, fit and function of both the compressors and the condenser. The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOps when issued.  Contractors are encouraged to check FedBizOps on a regular basis for the solicitation. See Numbered Notes 12, 22, and 26.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.203-1 and TAM 1206.302.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia, has a need for a Commercial Non-Developmental, JP8 fueled, tactical wheeled vehicle which can meet two primary requirements: externally transportable underneath the MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft (less than 10,000 lb curb weight); and the capability of towing the M777 LW155 Howitzer (tow capability greater than 10,000 lbs).  Internal transport within the CH-53E is desired.

A Request For Information (RFI) was released on 27 June 2003, a market survey was performed in September 2003, and a Capability Assessment was conducted from October 2003-May 2004.  The results of these three events revealed that a domestic capability to meet the United States Marine Corps needs using a commercial non-developmental vehicle does not exist.  

The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico Virginia intends to negotiate as part of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT), with the following four companies: Automotive Technik, Guildford, Surrey GU2 8XW, United Kingdom; Supacat Limited, The Airfield, Dunkeswell Honiton EX14 ORA, England; Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Krauss-Maffei-Strasse 11, D-80997, Munich, Germany; and MOWAG, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland.  This effort will procure demonstration vehicles, test support, and logistics support from each vendor to enable a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to be conducted.  Upon completion of the FCT, one vendor will be selected and production options may be exercised.

<SUBJECT>A--Multi Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) Electronic Surveillance (ES) Technology for DD(X)
<SOLNBR>N0001404R0012
<RESPDATE>060204
<CONTACT>Wade Wargo, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2574, Email wargow@onr.navy.mil - Vera Carroll, Branch Head ONR Code 253, Phone 703-696-2610, Email carrolv@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is the lead organization for development efforts being initiated under the Fleet/Force Protection (F/FP) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program.  One such technology project headed by ONR under the F/FP FNC is the Advanced Multi Function Radio Frequency Concept (AMRFC).   AMRFC is a program that addresses the increasing challenges of shipboard topside Radio Frequency (RF) functions. Specifically, AMRFC is developing and demonstrating technology for Electronic Warfare (EW), Radar, and RF Communications functions sharing common receive and transmit antennas.

Current U.S. Navy surface combatants employ a large number of RF apertures (antennas) to enable Electronic Warfare, Communication, and Radar functions.  Historically, each function (and hence system) has its own aperture, electronics, operator, and logistics/maintenance tail. This classic RF systems approach results in Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) issues which degrade system performance and increase life-cycle cost for the combatant.  Ship RF signature and radar cross section is difficult to reduce when restricted to classic RF aperture/antenna approaches. Additionally, future shipboard radars (Multi-Function Radar (MFR), Volume Surveillance Radar (VSR)) require more power and higher duty cycles which further compound EMI problems. 

The Navy’s identified need for improved platform signature control; reduced manning; reduced platform cross-section; and scalable, affordable, open systems architectures and technologies for future combatant antennas/apertures are the major drivers behind ONR’s AMRFC research efforts.

In order to address the issues of ship signature, physical size and weight constraints, performance, and life cycle cost; ONR has sponsored research for new electronics components, RF apertures, and system capabilities using broadband, multifunction, RF designs and advanced technologies.  The F/FP FNC program at ONR, through the AMRFC project and AMRFC test bed deployed at the Naval Research Laboratory’s (NRL) Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) site in Maryland, is developing the capability to integrate and demonstrate Radar, Electronic Warfare, Communications, and Aviation support functions into a common set of RF apertures. The test bed system is capable of generating multiple simultaneous beams performing multiple RF functions where the functionality is defined by software. ONR and the F/FP FNC is currently demonstrating this technology within the test bed at CBD.  AMRFC will reduce the acquisition cost risk of transitioning multi function RF technology to Navy surface combatants (DD(X), CVN-21) by demonstrating the functions of High Probability of Intercept (HPOI), Precision Direction Finding (PDF), High Gain/High Sensitivity (HG/HS) Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) of received signals, Electronic Attack (EA), Common Data Link (CDL) and Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL).

This notice is to announce ONR’s intent to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development, testing, and demonstration of a Multi Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) Electronic Warfare Support (ES) system for the DD(X) program.  MFEW (ES) is the designated title for specific follow-on work to transition multi function Electronic Warfare enabling technology previously performed under the AMRFC project initially identified as AMRFC/EW. This work specifically addresses the Electronic Warfare/Electronic Support (surveillance) requirements for the DD(X) and potentially other future U.S. Navy surface ship requirements. The ensuing awards from this RFP are intended to provide for the Technology Development (TD) and Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) phases of a Navy acquisition program.  The program will develop and demonstrate a proof of concept ES prototype.  The ES prototype will be a low observable multi function RF array antenna system.  It will demonstrate key performance capabilities and perform technology risk mitigation.  The proof of concept demonstration will be conducted in an at-sea environment representative of environmental conditions to be faced by shipboard installed systems.  MFEW (ES) will be integrated with other systems to be installed on the DD(X).  The initial effort will thus demonstrate the integration of the MFEW (ES) system with the ship’s combat, navigation, environment control via applicable Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) hardware and software.

The MFEW (ES) top-level technical objectives are contained in the AMRFC/EW Technology Transition Agreement (TTA) dated December 2003, and classified “SECRET”.  The initial EW capabilities required for MFEW (ES) will include HPOI, PDF and HG/HS. The system will demonstrate and perform passive detection; angle of arrival (AOA) determination; classification of threat, neutral and friendly emitters; and targeting of terminal seekers. The required ES capability sensitivity shall enable extended decision timelines by providing information that helps clear the tactical picture to support EW engagements at extended ranges.  The objective of the TD Phase is to demonstrate MFEW (ES) technology that provides the critical components for the development and deployment of an ES system that meets key operational and technical objectives.  Unit cost, platform integration and supportability are essential elements that will be continually assessed to conform to DD(X) requirements.  This ES capability will be an integrated element with the DD(X) combat system contributing to both DD(X) operations as well as operations with the battle group.  The ES capability to be demonstrated will contribute to own ships and battle group interoperability.

Initial efforts of the MFEW (ES) program include traceability of requirements from top-level DD(X) requirements to support ES requirements definition, trade studies, top-level system and subsystem designs. Threat analysis will be conducted and ES specifications will be developed that support DD(X) missions.  Threat, ES parameters and DD(X) integration and RCS requirements will be evaluated and requirements allocated to establish ES system architecture and critical multi function component/module specifications.  Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) will be a continuing task during all phases to assure an affordable open systems design is achieved. AMRFC developed technologies and results of testing will be evaluated to assess conformance with DD(X) EW performance requirements. AMRFC hardware and software components/modules will be evaluated and incorporated into the MFEW (ES) system design when their performance is evaluated and assessed to meet DD(X) EW requirements while also providing the most cost effective solution for specific MFEW (ES) functions. Analyses of existing SEWIP development efforts will be conducted in order to exploit existing capabilities that reduce risk as well as meet cost objectives and design requirements. Ongoing Science and Technology efforts such as ManTech and SBIR efforts will likewise be evaluated for potential transitions and applications to this development effort.

This RFP will provide for multiple awards of Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts.  Multiple contract and task order awards are anticipated based on major systems and component level procurements supporting the planned technology and systems demonstration. This may include multiple task order awards per task order solicitation. Sample tasks representative of the major deliverables that are anticipated to be procured via separate task orders under the multiple award contracts will be included within the RFP.  Offeror’s abilities to perform under the contract will be evaluated based on sample task proposals as well as additional criteria identified within the RFP. Offerors must show reasonable ability to perform the work under a sample task to be eligible for basic contract award.  The sample task proposals are for evaluation purposes only and will not be used to issue any initial task order awards.  The first task order solicitation is intended to be issued immediately after award of the basic contracts from this RFP. The anticipated basic contract award date is September 2004.  The contract will have a five-year ordering period.

The blanket Statement of Work under any ensuing basic contracts from this RFP will include the following types of tasks: requirements definition, trade studies, system and subsystem designs, threat analysis, development, fabrication, system integration, test, demonstration, production engineering, preparation of production documentation and qualification testing, and production and testing of limited quantities of system/subsystems, i.e., Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP), for the DD(X) platform.  The ensuing IDIQ contracts will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR and by PEO IWS 2.  ONR anticipates that the basic contract will have a maximum ordering ceiling of $200M.

It is anticipated that ONR will issue a Draft RFP on the ONR website at http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps/n00014_04_r_0012/ on approximately 16 APR 2004.   Industry’s comments to the Draft RFP should be provided by email (wargow@onr.navy.mil) to the ONR Contracting Officer on or before 30 APR 2004.   A final RFP is anticipated to be issued on approximately 03 MAY 2004.  No hardcopies of this RFP will be mailed, faxed, or emailed.  In order to submit a proposal under this solicitation, Offerors must possess a SECRET facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding.  The RFP will be unclassified, but the technical objectives in the TTA are classified “SECRET” and therefore will be provided under separate cover.

<SUBJECT>A--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION OF AN ORDNANCE INITIATION SYSTEM USING NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES APPLICABLE TO FLEET BALLISTIC MISSILE SYSTEMS
<SOLNBR>N0016404R4502
<RESPDATE>092704
<ARCHDATE>10272004
<CONTACT>Ellen McDaniel 8128545315
<DESC>The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center has a requirement to develop and to demonstrate an ordnance initiation system using new and emerging technologies applicable to fleet ballistic missile systems.  The Navy intends to develop the technologies required by the ordnance system, build a laboratory prototype of the system and demonstrate feasibility of the system in a relevant environment. The ordnance system prototype will be scaled down in order to meet schedule and budgetary requirements, however should provide an effective demonstration of key technological requirements scalable to the total system.  The proposed alternative ordnance system solution should use new and emerging technology and should identify advantages over the current Trident D5 ordnance system in terms of cost, safety, reliability, performance and versatility. To meet programmatic goals in terms  of cost reduction, the most practical design approach may employ an architecture that minimizes or eliminates the need for a linear ordnance energy transfer system that accounts for over 90% of the Trident D5 system costs (excluding controller/firing unit costs).  System versatility goals could be met by designing a system that is adaptable to multiple ordnance initiation functions such as, stage separation, gas generator and rocket motor ignition (both large boost motors and smaller eject/jettison motors), and missile destruct.  The event being initiated may be located a significant distance from control electronics sending signals commanding the function.  The ordnance system should be capable of accurate timing in terms of simultaneity and minimum function time.  The most technically challenging requirement for this design will be to meet system safety.  Compliance to MIL-S TD-1512, MIL-STD1576, MIL-STD-1316E, MIL-STD-1901A, and EWR 127-1 are to be considered as system design goals. Explosives used shall not be more sensitive to impact than PentaErythritol TetraNitrate (PETN). In-line or out-of line systems may be proposed based upon the explosive materials that are proposed.    Safety characteristics should be addressed with emphasis on sensitivity to shock (high-acceleration survivability), temperature range, vibration and hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance.  Other performance parameters that should be considered are system weight, energy consumption and the ability to withstand a broad range of environmental conditions including temperature, shock, vibration and electro-magnetic radiation.  Evaluation Criteria:  Proposals will compete for award based upon their potential value to the government in fulfilling the requirements st ated above.  That value will be determined using a combination of criteria including technical merit, affordability, and the governments confidence in effective pursuit of the effort considering the scope of the effort, the offeror’s understanding of it, the competence and availability of experienced engineering, scientific, managerial, personnel, the offeror’s corporate experience and the availability of, or ability to obtain, necessary facilities to perform this effort.  Cost realism and reasonableness will also be considered to the extent appropriate.  The primary goal of this R&D effort is to successfully demonstrate feasibility of an alternative ordnance initiation system suitable for strategic missile applications.  The best solution will be the most practical solution that demonstrates safe and reliable operation, is cost effective, can be adapted to initiate a variet y of events spaced throughout a large missile, and that best meet the requirements. The prototype system should include new and/or emerging technology that has not been previously demonstrated in a strategic missile application/environment.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, none or any combination of the proposals received.  The Navy may or may not choose to use the technology demonstrated in a follow-on strategic propulsion applications program. At minimum, proposals should address requirements stated above and include the method of initiation, prospective energetic materials, proposed system architecture, system safety mechanisms, system reliability, system timing and costs estimates and breakdown.   The Government reserves the right to request an oral presentation in addition to the submitted proposals.  All proprietary or classified informatio n will be handled appropriately.  The Navy will evaluate proposals with technical advisory support provided by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).  The planned completion date for this effort is 30 September 2007.  Estimated cost is $1,000,000 total and may be funded incrementally for a period up to 36 months.  The BAA package will be posted on the NSWC Crane web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil.    The POC for information regarding this procurement is Ms. Ellen McDaniel, telephone 812-854-5315, fax 812-854-5666 or email mcdaniel_e@crane.navy.mil.  It is anticipated that the BAA solicitation package will be released on or about 20 August 2004.  Numbered note 26 applies.

Basic Operation: When an Infant Security Tag (Tag) is attached to an infant and activated by inserting the strap a digital auto admit signal shall be sent to the ISS Controller through a Local Area Receiver (LAR). A tag description shall be entered at any ISS workstation to identify the infant.  While active, the tag shall transmit a "signal" every 10 sec., which shall be monitored by the ISS Controller through LARs on the data network. If the signal is not detected in a specified amount of time the system will alarm. If the tag or strap is tampered with, e.g. the strap cut, the tag shall send a tamper alarm through a LAR to the Controller, which then shall initiate a system wide alarm.  When an Infant Tag detects that it is within the range of a Portal Exciter, it shall receive the Exciter's ID nu mber and transmit the Exciter ID and it's own ID, which shall be received by a LAR. The LAR decodes the signal and forwards the data through the data network to the ISS Controller. The ISS Controller shall be capable of displaying the Infant Tag's unique serial code, the infant's last known location, the tag description and the time the signal was received. The Controller shall provide a programmable, audible announcement of each alarm. If the Controller determines that an unsafe condition is present, a security alarm shall be initiated. The Exciter and/or programmable I/O devices shall be capable of activating magnetic door locks and other security monitoring devices. The alarm can only be cancelled by password-authorized staff at any ISS Workstation. 		Environment: 1.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, intends to solicit Gulf Coast Holdings, Inc., DBA Unidynamics, 188 FM 3083, Conroe, TX 77301-6400 on a sole-source basis for Hydraulic Power Units, drawing number 6659940 Rev D. Unidynamics, Inc. was the sole manufacturer of the Hydraulic Power Units (HPU) used on all US Navy MCMs and MHCs.  A substantial amount of time and money was spent by the Government to qualify the Fleet’s current HPU design.  The current HPU design has been shock, vibration, and EMI qualified to MCM and MHC hardware requirement specifications.  Keeping with the same proven and existing design, is essential to maintaining configuration control and logistics support for over 26 HPUs currently in the US Fleet. Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407- 7001. NAICS Code 333999 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is 2030.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI); neither a draft statement of work nor specifications are available. The information received will be used as part of a market survey. Issuance of this RFI should not be construed as obligating the Department of Navy, in any way, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract in furtherance of the objectives discussed herein.  No funds are available to pay for preparing responses to this RFI.  Further, the Government is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. Written responses to this RFI are invited.

The Government is interested in promoting an exchange of information with industry to explore automating the preparation/review/approval and submission of the existing Navy  Performance Appraisal System through Web enablement. The automated system will support and improve the Navy’s performance evaluation support capability and provide an open, robust, and flexible environment that is compatible with other Navy Manpower, Personnel, and Training systems.  Intent is not to change the existing performance appraisal process, but to automate the existing paper based reporting tool.

Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. 

Background:

The Navy Personnel Command (NPC) in Millington, Tennessee is the official military personal records manager for the Navy.  In addition to processing and accepting approved information into individual officer/sailor records, maintaining and supplying Navy personnel records to authorized for users, NPC is responsible for efficient generation and validation of information IAW Article 1129, U.S. Navy Regulations, 1990, that requires records be maintained on Naval personnel "which reflect their fitness for the service and performance of duties". 

The Performance Evaluation Branch of the Military Personnel Records Management Division develops and establishes procedures for the overall management and control of the Navy officer and enlisted personnel performance evaluation system.  To document their performance throughout their entire career, all officers in the U.S. Navy receive either a Report on the Fitness of Flag Officers and Flag Selectees (NAVPERS 1611/2) or a Report on Fitness of Officers (FITREPs) (NAVPERS 1611/1).  Enlisted members receive performance evaluations (EVALs) (NAVPERS 1616/24).  FITREPs and EVALs are used to make numerous decisions affecting the career of each officer and enlisted member, particularly their assignments and promotions. Continuity of performance evaluations is maintained in the permanent personnel record by submission of FITREPs and EVALs.

The following provides an overview of the current system.

“As-Is” NAVFIT System:

Currently, the front end NAVFIT98A stand-alone software application supports electronic preparation and paper submission of Fitness Reports/Evaluations (FITREPs/EVALs) for processing into the Electronic Military Personnel Records System (EMPRS).  The submission is scanned and extracted metadata is validated against the corporate data system prior to acceptance and inclusion of the images into the ratee’s official record.  NAVFIT98A is not integrated with the Navy corporate data system and does not provide an automated approval process for routing or an electronic signature capability.  NAVFIT98A is a static non-automated form-fill software application.  

Also, existing performance appraisals include the SSN of the reporting senior.  This information is required to record the grades a reporting senior assigns to personnel, and is accumulated over time to determine a reporting senior’s score average.  Potential for identity theft has raised the concern that the reporting senior SSN should not be included in the performance appraisal information provided to the member being evaluated. 
The current system provides a tool to create, store, organize, validate and print FITREPs/EVALs for signature.  The system also produces the summary sheet required for each reporting group to be mailed to the Naval Personnel Command along with copies of the FITREPs/EVALs.

This system is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974 and is in the sustainment phase.
The software of the current NAVFIT system is a combination of COTS and GOTS developed software.  Briefly the high-level software items include:

·	MS Windows Operating System
·	NAVFIT 98 software
·	MS Access (for development/support purposes)
·	MS Visual Basic 6.0 (for development purposes)

The current NAVFIT system is stand-alone.  However, the source document is eventually scanned into EMPRS and from the scan process a transaction is generated that updates the Naval Personnel Evaluation System (NPES).

“To-Be” NAVFIT System:

Replace the current NAVFIT98A software application with an automated NAVFIT system solution that provides all functionality, including data storage, business logic, business processes, and end-user (NAVFIT) applications to support efficient on-line processing of FITREP/EVAL reports and be integrated with “source date” system, validation data source system, and permanent record storage system. .  The NAVFIT system will also be designed to facilitate off-line or stand-alone reporting capability.  Specifically, the NAVFIT System must be useable in a standard office setting or in a mobile environment using deployable computer systems (e.g., surface ships, submarines, and detached ground units such as SeaBees or SEALs).   Existing business processes of current NAVFIT will not be replaced.

WebClient/WebServer architecture with data storage repositories, business logic, and application layers is included within the scope of the NAVFIT system.  On-line users will use a centrally located system, while off-line (remote) users will need the capability of processing performance evaluations at the remote location at the Reporting Senior level.  The NAVFIT System shall be designed and implemented to allow web-based workgroup clusters to exist within secure discrete NAVFIT domains.  Each remote NAVFIT domain will exist at the Reporting Senior level.  To this end, each Reporting Senior will have WebServer capabilities, with each of their direct reporting Senior Raters, Raters, and Members maintaining WEBClient functionality, either through the central or remote system.  

Data, personnel records, and workgroup control shall be maintained at the central system and remote Reporting Senior’s WebServer, and accessed by the appropriate designated Navy personnel.  For the central system, data shall be retrieved from the designated corporate systems upon request (on-demand), or by the automatic polling function, and shall physically reside on the central system WebServer.  For off-line systems, data shall be retrieved from the designated corporate systems upon request (on-demand) when the system is on-line.  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality shall exist through the WebServer, either centrally or remotely, and be accessible by the presentation layer residing at each WebClient location.  All network connectivity shall be provided by secure network connections.  

Output from the automated NAVFIT system is part of the permanent record and must be sent to and received by the Electronic Military Personnel Records System (EMPRS), which will be using IBM’s Content Management system.

<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston intends to negotiate a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 with ETM Electromatic, Inc, 35451 Dumbarton Court, Newark, CA 94560-1100.  The proposed action is for the acquisition of Commercial Satellite Communications products and the necessary service to support the Global Broadcast Service's satellite communications needs.  The planned contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Time and Materials (T&M) type contract. SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston has a requirement for replacement and spare Ka-Band EIKs (Enhanced Interaction Klystrons) and High Power Amplifiers for the Global Broadcast Service (GBS). The Government requires that the prospective Contractor have at least ten (10) years experience in the design, manufacture and marketing of high power microwave tube amplifier systems and test equipment. These products and services will be used around the world in support of the US Government's satellite communications, replacement and spare EIKs and/ or HPAs must have absolute form, fit, and functional compatibility with existing equipment, including such parts as CPI's VKA2400W04 Enhanced Interaction Klystron and ETM's A27401-002 600W Ka-Band HPA, among others, as well as equivalent reliability and RF characteristics, without need for change of operator or safety procedures, nor retraining of operating personnel. These RF systems are used by the GBS satellite uplinks at sites in CONUS, OCONUS, and overseas, world-wide. The Ka-Band HPA generates the Extremely High Frequency (e.g. Ka-band) RF that amplifies the modulated signal for transmission to the satellite, which is retransmitted to US Forces deployed world-wide. Joint tactical operations require the continuous flow of high-speed, high-volume multimedia communications and information flow for deploying, deployed, on the move and garrisoned forces. The Global Broadcast Service (GBS) employs Direct Broadcast Service broadcast technologies that contribute to satisfying warfighter information requirements in the conduct of modern warfare. The need for a GBS is defined in the joint validated Mission Needs Statement (MNS) for Global Broadcast Service, 3 August 1995. Current military satellite communications systems are oversubscribed and are not designed to deliver high volume, continuous information to multiple users. Many products today require transmission of imagery and data files with sizes in the megabyte range. GBS provides a worldwide, high-capacity, primarily one-way transmission means for GBS-managed information consisting of video (and audio), data, imagery, and other information product types. Additionally, due to the long lead time to manufacture such critical components as the EIK and HPA, to mitigate the potential adverse impact to the operational readiness of the GBS broadcast the GBS Joint Program Office (JPO) has decided to order replacement EIKs in advance of sustaining losses in the field. However, the EIK requires certain periodic maintenance to include "reconditioning", a process that removes trace gasses from within the EIK. This procedure requires the use of specialized equipment, and trained personnel. In addition to possessing the personnel, training, and specialized equipment to perform this maintenance, the prospective Contractor must have at least five (5) years experience performing such maintenance. Furthermore, the EIK/HPA is a commercial item and must have at least a twelve-month warranty, starting when the EIK is delivered to the US Government. Therefore, the manufacturer, or reseller for the replacement EIK, must have the quality processes, procedures, and technical capability to perform all production, integration, testing, and periodic maintenance without voiding the manufacturer's warranty. Prospective Contractors must show documented proof of a quality management program that is recognized by international bodies, such as the ISO, and by major US corporations. In addition to supplying the EIK, the prospective Contractor must possess the necessary field service technicians with the technical expertise to service and troubleshoot fielded EIK and HPA, as required. Due to the large investment and critical nature of GBS' satellite communications, the US Government may require that field technical services be rendered at short notice, to include travel to remote locations world-wide. Travel expenses are reimbursed IAW the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR). This notice is for planning purposes only.  If satisfactory responses are received, a solicitation may be issued for an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type time and materials contract. Firms are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references (limited to 50 pages maximum) to support their expertise and show past history of satellite communications with capabilities to meet or exceed the stated requirements. Responses shall be submitted to SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston, Code 0215GB, PO Box 190022, North Charleston, SC 29419-9022, or by electronic mail (grace.brown@navy.mil) by 2:00 pm on 16 July 2004. THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUCTED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.

<DESC>This is a draft RFI being posted to alert industry to a solicitation that will be issued in the future and to obtain comment from industry on a draft of the performance work statement intended to be used for the procurement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The U.S. Department of State intends to procure services to support the Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement in the accomplishment of its Humanitarian Mine Action and Small Arms/Light Weapons Removal and Destruction mission.  The types of services to be included in this procurement are: Program Planning and Management Support, Program Administration Support, Information Management Support, Program Review, Quality Oversight Support, and Program Awareness and Outreach Support.  A  SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of a contract.  A DRAFT copy of the performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis.  The Government intends to award to small business.  The Department anticipates the award of one or more indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, with Task Orders being issued to subsequently authorize the work.  It is anticipated that cost-reimbursable and firm fixed price elements will be used for this procurement. Any task orders awarded under the contract may be a combination of firm fixed price and cost reimbursable elements depending on the nature of the work.  At least one yet to be determined task order will be competed at time of contract award. The RFP is not complete but a draft of the performance work statement (PWS) is enclosed for comment.  A Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (developed by and implemented by the Government) and incentive plan have not been written yet and we welcome comments from industry in these areas.  ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  In accordance with FAR 15.201, this DRAFT RFI is an "exchange with industry before receipt of proposals".  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SMALL UNINHABITED AIR VEHICLE ENGINES (SUAVE), SOL BAA04-12, Addendum 6, DUE: 10/15/04.  POC:  Dr. William Coblenz, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4647, Email: baa04-12@darpa.mil; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412. Description. The Defense Sciences Office is interested in innovative research ideas for design and prototyping of Small Uninhabited Air Vehicle Engines (SUAVE).  The SUAVE program seeks to demonstrate gas turbine engines under 10 horsepower that are highly efficient (greater than 25% thermal efficiency), power densities greater than 2 horsepower per pound, capable of utilizing heavy fuel (i.e., JP-8, JP-5), and with a durability exceeding 500 hours.  Engine designs with high efficiency over a large power range would be especially useful for UAV mission profiles that typically include both sprint and loiter modes of operation.  Successful offerors will combine innovative designs that exploit the high temperature capabilities of structural ceramics.  It is the intent of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals that only consider revolutionary advancements in small size scale propulsion.  Background. Ceramic components are of interest for the hot section components of gas turbine engines where they enable higher turbine inlet temperatures and, therefore, higher thermal efficiencies.  In most cases, the ceramic components are substituted for metal components with only minor design changes to accommodate the brittle failure mode of ceramics.  The compressive strength of ceramic materials are typically a factor of 10 higher than the tensile strength, suggesting the adoption of designs in which rotating ceramic components go into compression as they spin-up. This design approach suggests ceramic blades placed on the inside of rotating cylinders rather than blades attached to a rotating shaft.  Engines of this design have been referred to as either exoskeleton or inside-out designs.  Design variations might include:  utilization of air or magnetic bearings; radial staging of turbine and compressor sections; and/or high power density motor-generators to extract power from turbine sections and operate inlet fans.  Accommodation of steady-state and transient thermal stresses is particularly important in ceramic engine components.  Exploiting rapid prototyping methods that build ceramic or metal components without part-specific tooling and which can be modified to spatially control composition, may be useful in producing surface compressive stresses and thermally insulating surface layers.   Commercially available gas turbine engines in this power range are typically less than 10% efficient.  Design issues specific to small gas turbines related to the high surface to volume ratio to be addressed include reduction of tip clearance losses, thermal losses, and reduced transit time for combustion.  Miniaturization of auxiliary equipment, such as transmissions and fuel pumps, can also be a problem at small size scale.  The design of a transmission for a small turboprop gas turbine engine spinning in excess of 150,000 rpm would be particularly challenging.  Since power density of electric motors and generators increases with rotational speed, turboelectric variant gas turbines might be particularly effective.  Gas turbine engines designed to produce thrust directly for propulsion are also of interest in this program; however, conditions used to calculate engine efficiency must be clearly stated relative the intended use in powering small UAVs. Silicon nitride and silicon carbide have been the materials that have attracted the most interest for use in gas turbine engines.  Designs that will put the ceramic components into compression and manufacturing methods (such as Solid Freeform) may justify consideration of other ceramic systems for use in engines.  It is anticipated that once developed these small gas turbine engines will find additional uses, such as:  generation of electrical power on the battlefield, battery recharging systems that operate on logistics fuel 
(JP-8), and providing emergency home power.  Proposals responding to this addendum must describe a 12-month Phase I program that will design an engine, meeting program goals, and conduct design-specific critical component demonstrations.  Quantitative performance milestones must be identified for each critical component of the engine.  (For example:  Spin test filament wound radial ceramic rotor assembly at 150K rpm; or demonstrate operation of motor-generator with > 5 HP/lb at 150K rpm.)  Phase II of the SUAVE program (not to exceed 24 months) will build 3 flight-weight engines at least one of which meets program goals including a 500 hour durability test with 50 engine on/off cycles.  The discussion of engine designs and suggested materials of construction in this addendum are given as examples of possible technical approaches and do not limit what may be proposed in meeting program goals.  Teaming. 
Progress in the SUAVE program will be dependent on the formation of well-managed, interdisciplinary teams that should possess the necessary expertise in design of gas turbine engines, design and fabrication of subsystems (fuel injector, electric motor-generators, rapid prototyping of ceramic aerospace quality components, testing).  There are no definitive requirements for the types of institutions (industry, university, etc.) that make up any particular team.  Members of the interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the objectives.  A web page has been established to facilitate teaming for the benefit of parties interested in forming or joining a team at: http://suave.walcoff.com.  Non-proprietary information may be entered on this web page.  
White Paper and Proposal Information. We invite white papers (8 pages or less) in response to this announcement.  Proposers are strongly encouraged (but are not required) to submit white papers (pre-proposals) in advance of full proposals. The paper shall be organized in the following manner: (1) An Executive Summary.  A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea. We are looking for ideas that will generate revolutionary capabilities if the proposed work is successfully completed over a 3 year period of performance; (2) A concise statement of the scientific and technical challenges, unique approaches, and anticipated potential technical solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This statement should demonstrate that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art; (3) Explicit timelines and milestone achievements by which progress toward the goals can be evaluated.  These milestones must reflect a period of performance of 12 months for Phase 1.  Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics of performance; (4) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding; (5) A brief summary of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members and a management plan for multi-organizational teams. White papers sent in response to this addendum are due no later than 1600 hours ET, August 31, 2004.

<DESC>The Government intends to purchase the following item sole source from TLD ACE (00365) the only known approved source.  TLD ACE is the only manufacturer of this dual voltage refrigerant compressor which will satisfy form, fit, and function of the TLD ACE end item ACE-410 Flight line Air Conditioner.  Item description: Noun: Refrigerator Compressor; NSN: 4120-01-153-0996RN; PN: 1004431; Period of Performance: Basic – One year, Option – 3 years; Basic Qty: 2 EA; Option Qty: 1-5; weight 999 pounds, 8 cylinder piston type R-134a refrigerant, 73.6 horsepower.  Functional Description: Refrigerant compressors are designed specifically for air conditioning, heat pumping, and refrigeration.  Small, stand-alone compressors are not included within this group.  Refrigerant compressors are large –scale units specifically designed to be the heart of an industrial cooling or air-conditioning system (HVAC).  They are integral components of the refrigerant cycle, in which refrigerant gases are cyclically evaporated and condensed, absorbing heat from the load to be cooled, and moved to an open environment where it is dissipated.  The compressor serves two main functions: to compress low pressure, low gases into high pressure and temperature gases, and to remove vapors from the evaporator to maintain a low boiling point.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled JIMO PROGRAM HIGH VOLTAGE RADIATION RESISTANT SPACE RATED CONNECTORS solicitation number NNC0462589R which was posted on June 10, 2004.  This modification is being issued as a question/answer clarification on the SOW. The due date for responses is extended to July 14, 2004. General Comment: The main purpose of this procurement is to identify connectors candidates that meet the radiation and other environmental requirements that JIMO will encounter during the voyage to Jupiter.  At this point in the JIMO program, system size and weight are not as important as the ability to withstand the space environment (temperature and radiation). The connector prototypes shall be sized for the termination of the three wire types given in the SOW. It is the primary intent of the program to perform radiation tests on the connectors and to evaluate them post irradiation to see if the properties of the materials changed so as to affect their usage in a detrimental way. As the program develops, more specific requirements, testing and layouts will be decided. Again, it is the specific aim of this proposal to get connectors that can withstand the radiation and temperature environments. Q1: Is there a size envelope?   A1: No. we have no size constraints, however future requirements for flight units would want the connectors to have the smallest envelope possible yet meet the requirements. Q2: Is there a maximum weight requirement?  A2: No, however future requirements for flight units would want the connectors to have lowest weight possible yet meet the requirements. Q3: Recognizing the information stated under Section 3.4 Current Rating, are there more specific details on expected current flow through each type of connector?  A3: No.  The wire terminations should be sized for the wire sizes stated for the three wire types. Q4: Is the shielding the return, i.e. current carrying?  A4: No Q5: Under Section 3.12, is there a more specific desired minimum value for maximum attenuation?   A5: As a design goal 50 dB @ 10 GHz shall be used. Q6: What is the unit for the 1 in the 1 to 10 GHz specification? A6: The 1 is a typo. It should be 100 MHz. Q7: Under phase two, it appears that each type is intended to have once shielded pair.  Is this the intent?   A7: The intent is to deliver connectors for the three wire types listed in phase 2 that would include any changes made to the connector materials that may improve their ability to meet our requirements shown to be deficient as a result of tests performed by NASA. Q8: What insulation is being used on the 530 C Type 2 wire?   A8: The wire insulation for Type 2 wire has not been determined yet, you can assume it will be glass insulation. Q9: What level of isolation is required for each Type?  A9: TBD by vendor testing. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought:  The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center is seeking qualified sources that have the capability and expertise to perform the overhaul or core exchange of York International Inc air conditioning compressors and marine air conditioning condenser (condenser originally manufactured by Dunham Bush, Inc).  These items are required for the support of the 378’ WHEC and 270’ WMEC class cutters air conditioning systems.  It is the Coast Guard’s belief that only York International can perform the overhaul or core exchange of both the air conditioning compressors and condenser. All work or core exchange shall be performed in accordance with OEM specifications and standards, utilizing only genuine OEM replacement parts.  The compressors and condenser that will be included on this intended acquisition are: (1) Stock Number 4130-01-487-5141, Compressor Part Number JE421, estimated quantity of 2 per year; (2) National Stock Number 4130-01-269-0125, Compressor Part Number SS63C, estimated quantity of 4 per year; (3) National Stock Number 4130-01-114-4487, Compressor Part Number SS62B, estimated quantity of 2 per year; and (4) National Stock Number 4130-01-492-5250, Condenser Part Number CDRM1237A2L, estimated quantity of 2 per year.  Contractor shall be required to provide all labor, materials required to open, inspect, report, repair, test, preserve, and package all compressors and condenser in accordance with current OEM specifications and standards.  The Coast Guard intends to award a firm fixed requirements contract for a base year and four option years.  Technical, engineering data and drawings to successfully overhaul or provide a core exchange of both the compressors and condenser are proprietary information, which are not available to the Government.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the technical and engineering data required to successfully perform the work is only available from one source, York International.  It is the Government’s belief that only York International possesses the capabilities to repair in accordance with OEM requirements to ensure the proper form, fit and function of both the compressors and the condenser. Other sources that believe they have the expertise and required capabilities to perform the work are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities within 15 calendar days from the date of this published notice.  This information shall include (1) data that the referenced compressors and/or condenser have been successfully repaired in accordance with OEM standards, using only genuine OEM parts; and (2) past performance information relating to repair of these item including agency/customer name, address and telephone number, order number, date, and price paid for the repair and core exchange.  This information SHALL BE RECEIVED IN THIS OFFICE WITHIN 15 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE THIS NOTICE IS PUBLISHED.  Information received after this deadline shall not impede award of this contract, but will be considered for future acquisitions.  The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited.  See Numbered Notes 12, 22, and 26.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.203-1 and TAM 1206.302.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for Information Technology (IT) capabilities to satisfy the full range of DTRA IT and information processing needs in support of the DTRA Arms Control mission and mission support.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only and in no way obligates the government to issue a solitation.  

The DTRA Arms Control Information and Notification (ACIN) Program supports the identification and assessment of emerging technologies and techniques potentially applicable in the Arms Control arena, the incorporation of those technologies and techniques that are deemed to be cost and mission effective into the operational information processing environment, and the evolving operation of a sound IT program that provides maximum flexibility and utility to satisfy existing and future compliance monitoring and reporting requirements for DTRA.

This Sources Sought Synopsis specifically addresses the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES), a project under the ACIN Program which is intended to replace the current U.S. Compliance Monitoring and Tracking System (CMTS).  The ACES project supports the continued development of a new system based on the approved requirements, architecture, and technical approach.  Although the architecture, design and hardware have already been selected and approved, the contractor will continue to assess emerging technologies and techniques.

In a potential future solicitation, DTRA could select a Contractor who shall assist in the modernization of all lifecycle aspects of CMTS as it applies to the DTRA Arms Control mission and mission support.  Request respondents respond to requirements in five task areas, as follows:  

&#61623; Task Area A:  Requirements and Systems Engineering – Review, refine and implement lifecycle engineering and management processes, including configuration and requirements management.  The contractor will execute previously defined and documented systems engineering process standards acceptable to DTRA, to continue development of technical alternatives, the review and implementation of technical specifications and the allocation of specifications (and capabilities) to software releases within the context of the overall systems engineering approach.

&#61623; Task Area B:  IT Development – Analyze the DTRA developed architecture, technical specifications, systems engineering documentation, hardware and detailed systems designs, with the primary objective of developing usable, testable software.  The contractor will review previously documented systems architectures, fine-tune high level and detailed systems designs, support design reviews, conduct development, and update or prepare documentation (including development documentation, end-user documentation, systems administration documentation, and training documentation).

&#61623; Task Area C:  IT Test and Evaluation – Testing and evaluation of software, hardware, DBMS, and telecommunications systems.  Activities performed will define and implement development testing, develop test plans and test cases, and support acceptance testing of a developed system.

&#61623; Task Area D:  IT Implementation/Deployment – Deployment of hardware, software, DBMS, and telecommunications systems.  Activities performed will accommodate delivery and installation of completed systems, delivery of final versions of software, user and systems documentation, and support training activities.

&#61623; Task Area E:  IT Assessments and Technical Support – Development and delivery of studies and assessments in support of the ACES Project.  Activities performed will include delivery of studies and assessments, information briefings, and support to negotiation teams.

The Contractor shall ensure that the IEEE/EIA 12207 standard for defining, planning, managing, developing, verifying and validating, and documenting software products are applied for all tasks performed under Task Areas B, C, D, and E.  The Contractor shall employ structured engineering management processes; to this end, DTRA seeks sources evaluated at SEI CMM Level 2 or higher.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposals: it is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability of suppliers should a  Request for Proposal (RFP) be issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought are strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Prospective suppliers may supply a capability summary not to exceed ten (10) pages in length describing their relevant corporate experience, and their approach to meeting the requirements for CMMI evaluation and/or ISO 9000 certification.  DTRA encourages submissions for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned business, and 8(a) sources for elements of the proposed statement of work.  All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall include a point of contact and be received no later than 23 July  2004.  Upon request the government will provide the System/Software Requirements Specification and the System Architecture Requirements Allocation Document.  Requests for documentation should be submitted to James Copeland at james.copeland@dtra.mil.  All other questions and the responses to this request should be submitted to Amy Kruger at amy.kruger@dtra.mil.  All documentation provided shall become the property of the government.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Ground-Based Studies for Human Health in Space NASA Research Announcement (NNH04ZUU003N) Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Ground-Based Studies for Human Health in Space (NNH04ZUU003N) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, Ground-Based Studies for Human Health in Space (see    http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_u/nra/current/NNH04ZUU003N/index.html   ). This NRA solicits ground-based research for the Biomedical Model Systems (BMS) Program, a component of the Fundamental Space Biology Division and for the Biomedical Research and Countermeasures (BRC) Program, a component of the Bioastronautics Research Division, including the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). This consolidated NRA supports the following goals and objectives of the NASA Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR): (1)  Understand the physiological mechanisms responsible for space-flight-related biomedical and behavioral changes in humans in support of countermeasure development; (2)  Develop countermeasures that allow humans to live and work in microgravity for long durations, minimize the risks in readapting to gravity, and optimize crew safety, well-being, and performance; and (3)  Identify, characterize, and mitigate health, environmental, and other operational human medical risks associated with space exploration. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the Ground-Based Studies for Human Health in Space NRA to develop proposals and execute the development and validation of predictive assessment tool(s) and / or component and/or subsystem.  Subject to the availability of funds, selected partner proposal(s) would result in the development and validation of predictive assessment tool(s) and / or component and/or subsystem contract(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical / clinical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to develop and validate predictive assessment tools consistent and/or to develop and test instrument technologies with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel - This criteria evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control - This criteria evaluates the proposers ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities - This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. The proposer should specify which LaRC technology proposal(s) they  are addressing.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  Your responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Lisa.C.Simonsen, Mail Stop 202, Building 1229, Room 202, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Lisa.C.Simonsen@nasa.gov  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Nancy M. Sessoms, Contracting Officer 757-864-2471 Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov  The due date for submission is 4:00 p.m. local time July 16, 2004. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships. The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for questions are provided below:   (1)  Predictive and Current State Measurement of Cognitive, Personality, and Psycho-Social Factors For Long-Duration Space Flight; Technical point of contact: Jon Jonsson, Ph.D. (email: Jon.E.Jonsson@nasa.gov) Phone: 757-864-2001   NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners for the development of psychological tests which will provide both concurrent and predictive state measurement of cognitive, personality, and inter-personal factors for Long-Duration Space Flight.  These flights, by their very definition, will involve human space travel over significant periods of time.  The prolonged confinement in the space habitat, with the same personnel and operational routines that need to be accomplished during the mission may result in potential decrements in psychological well-being. This could include abnormal personality changes, increased frustration/aggression and decreased cognitive performance of critical mission activities.  To address these critical issues and avoid the potentially negative psychological effects of extended space travel, periodic standardized psychological testing has been suggested as a method to determine each crew member’s current psychological health and as a diagnostic and predictive tool for identifying potential crew members who may have a higher probability of experiencing such problems in the future.  Identification could lead to reduction and/or elimination of potential crew performance errors and identify those members who are experiencing psychological difficulties. Partners are sought with expertise in psychometric testing, which should include development of standardized psychological tests, development of test items, and experience with the evaluation of test validity (both concurrent and predictive), reliability and performance.

<SUBJECT>99--FOCAL PLANE ARRAY WITH A PIXEL SIZE OF 1024 X 1024.
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to QWIP Technologies, LLC, Altadena, CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center's Subsystem Test and Analysis Branch require a Focal Plane Array (FPA) with a pixel size of 1024 x 1024.  This array will be used during calibration of the Objective MIRSP projector of the same pixel size.  It has been determined that a one-to-one pixel ratio is ideal.  Currently, QWIP Technologies is the only vendor that manufactures an array of this size.  This array is required to be supplied as GFE to Lockheed Martin/Santa Barbara Focal Plane, to integrate into their Long Wave Infrared Camera no later than 2 August 2004. In order to use another vendor's array would require writing new software and accomplishing hardware integration with the existing camera.  Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than QWIP Technologies meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required  is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. Award to a vendor other than QWIP Technologies would result in the acquisition of substandard equipment that will not meet mission requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 16, 2004, will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>B -- CONTINUE SERVICES FOR JOINT PROJECT TO DETERMINE  WAYS SSA CAN IMPROVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF CHILDHOOD CASES
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) (formerly the American Association of University Affiliated Programs (AAUAP)) to continue to provide services for an on-going joint SSA/AUCD project to determine the ways that SSA can improve policies and procedures for the adjudication of childhood cases.  In the past 5 years of the project, under the joint guidance of SSA and the AUCD, State Disability Determination Services (DDSs) identified childhood SSI cases in specific cohorts for referral to local University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) for interdisciplinary medical evaluations on a consultative basis.  The evaluations were conducted following a set protocol devised jointly by SSA and the AUCD.  These examinations are still continuing, but to date the UCEDDs have conducted hundreds of examinations and case reviews since the beginning of the project.  SSA has used findings from the project to improve SSI childhood disability regulations and instructions as well as develop training.  Demonstration projects have been conducted to increase collaboration between the DDS and UCEDD sites.  Considerable work remains, including a variety of activities SSA needs to do based on analyses of the cases from the first 5 years.  The contract shall have two major tasks: (1) Develop training for adjudicators in the DDSs (including disability examiners and medical and psychological consultant staff), the Office of Hearings and Appeals (including administrative law judges, administrative appeals judges in the Appeals Council, and attorney and other support staff), quality review components (including regional Disability Quality Branches and Regional Office medical support staff), and other personnel (including Central Office staff).  The training will address a specific issue regarding the evaluation of SSI childhood disability claims identified as a result of the interdisciplinary assessments conducted during the first 5 years of the project and analyses of the findings from the project.  (2) Develop demonstration projects designed to improve collaboration between selected UCEDDs and DDSs.  The project designs shall be based on, and build upon, the experience in case referrals and DDS/UCEDD collaboration during the first 5 years of the project.  The goals are to improve SSA's ability to gather appropriate evidence, to help to reduce the number of children who need SSI disability benefits, and to help more children ultimately to leave the SSI disability rolls, improving SSA's stewardship of the SSI childhood program.  The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel and facilities to accomplish each of these tasks.  The period of performance for this requirement will be for a base year beginning September 30, 2004 through September 29, 2005 with one 1-year option to extend the term of the contract.  To the Government’s knowledge, the AUCD is the only national association that represents and supports the network of UCEDDs throughout the United States.  There are UCEDDs in every state and territory of the United States, and each UCEDD is affiliated with a major research university.  UCEDDs specialize in the assessment of individuals with developmental disabilities, the kinds of impairments that are the focus of this project.  For the timely and cost-effective completion of the tasks, SSA is not aware of any other organization that exists in so many sites throughout the country and that has: (1) Understanding of the specific populations in this project, (2) The academic expertise, (3) The variety of medical specialties at each site for conducting interdisciplinary assessments, (4) Expert personnel who can assist families who participate in the project, (5) Specialized knowledge regarding the school, early intervention, and other evidence SSA needs, (6) Understanding of the SSI disability program requirements, and (7) Connection with other Federal, State and local agencies.  The AUCD and the UCEDD network have participated in the project since 1999.  As a consequence they are not only familiar with the process, but have formed relationships with their local DDSs and have made necessary adjustments within their sites to accommodate our needs to quickly conduct the examinations and provide their reports.  AUCD has participated in the analyses of the results and will understand and be best able to accomplish the tasks of the contract.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this contract.  The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for proposals nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they have the capability to provide SSA the required services may submit a capability statement to Barbara F. Hands by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 1710 GWYNN OAK AVENUE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21207; by email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov or by fax to 410-966-9310.  All responses shall be marked COLLABORATION PROJECT and shall be received no later than  3:00 p.m. (EST) July 23, 2004.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with AUCD.  All questions must be in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Barbara F. Hands.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

Proposal for Implementing Painting Contractor Certification Program (PCCP)
Background.
Historically, the Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) has been plagued with pre-mature coating failures on surfaces deemed “critical-coated” surfaces i.e. bilges, u/w body surfaces, potable water tanks, flight deck surfaces, etc…Such coating failures typically lead to a loss of cutter operational days and increase contract costs.  When confronting pre-mature coating failures, in most cases, MLCA is dealing with “mom-and-pop” type shipyards; sadly, as a result of careful investigating, these failures are often attributed to a lack of Quality Control (QC) in said yards.
What we have done and are doing.
MLCA has attempted to remedy this problem by including a variety in-process quality control requirements in coating specifications; in addition, over the past 5 years, one of our main efforts has been that of requiring contractors to hire Technical Representatives/Coating Inspectors, who are professionally trained (at a minimum), to the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) coating Inspector Session I., to oversee all aspects of critical coating applications.  Unfortunately, due in part to the difficulty of enforcement in the field, this effort has been, largely, unsuccessful.  An additional contributing factor is contractor use of free technical services from coating manufactures - a practice recently prohibited in our specifications.
What we propose as a next step.
As is currently required by NAVSEA and various other major facility owners, the next logical step, in addressing this problem, is to require contractor certification.  In our view, the Painting Contractor Certification Programs (PCCP), developed and managed by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC), would be the appropriate certifying medium.  The SSPC programs are based on consensus standards developed by a diverse committee of industry professionals; they are nationally recognized independent contractor evaluation programs.  They are also a handy pre-qualification tool for facility owners and others who hire industrial painting contractors.  Among several of the certification programs, the “QP-1” program, at a minimum, involves reviewing the painting contractors’ primary ability to provide quality work (surface preparation and protective coating application), and assessing contractor conformance with applicable safety, health and environmental compliance standards.
Certification particulars.
Initial certification costs are between $5000 and $7500; annual renewal is required at a minimal cost to the contractor.  Consequences for certified contractors who violate established safety, quality, environmental, and or ethical practice standards of performance include (but are not limited to) the following:  warnings, probationary periods, suspensions or revocation of certification by the SSPC.
Enforcing the PCCP requirements.
The MLCA recognizes the importance of maintaining a broad contractor base.  In fact, as part of the PCCP implementation, we would actively engage contractors by providing advance notification of intent to use the “QP-1” program as a qualifying factor.  Specifically, all prospective bidders for preservation work for the aforementioned critical-coated surfaces could expect advance notice of six months to one year - to facilitate their compliance efforts.  The notice would read was follows:
”Notice To Contractors:  This is to advise all concerned parties that all Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) commercial availability projects advertised on or after 01 October 2004 will require that any contractors engaged in surface preparation and coating application be certified by SSPC to the requirements of SSPC-QP 1, prior to contract award.   The MLCA retains the option of including these requirements in any projects advertised prior to the listed date above.  Information on the SSPC certification programs can be found at www.sspc.org”.
The vessel procurement branch (vpl) would enforce the PCCP requirements in a manner that is fair and equitable.  Rules for certification and re-certification have been established by SSPC to provide a reasonable amount of time for all parties to perform the required tasks; however, SSPC can provide temporary extensions where "good-faith" efforts have not succeeded in fulfilling all requirements.  The policy of enforcement of the basic PCCP requirement, initially, and for fostering continuous certification would be as follows:
·	Contractors would be allowed to work during their certification period only.
·	Upon expiration of the certification, work would be stopped and would re-start only upon presentation of a valid certification, or written certification extension, from SSPC.
·	No grace period would be allowed and liquidated damages would not be waived for non-performance due to expired certification.
Placing Requirement for PCCP in Project Specification.
At the time of implementation, the “General Requirements” item would be amended with a paragraph that conveys the intent of PCCP implementation; it would read as follows:
“All contractors and subcontractors that perform surface preparation or coating application shall be certified by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) to the requirements of SSPC QP 1 prior to contract award, and shall remain certified while accomplishing any surface preparation or coating application.  The painting contractors and painting subcontractors must remain so certified for the duration of the project.  If a contractors’ or subcontractors’ certification expires, the contractor will not be allowed to perform any work until the certification has been reissued.  Requests for extension of time for any delay to the completion of the project due to an inactive certification will not be considered and liquidated damages will apply. Notify the KO of any change in contractor certification status”.
Conclusion.
The SSPC certification programs would offer the MLCA the advantage of knowing that the industrial painting contractors who are working on its projects have the experience, knowledge and equipment to produce quality work in accordance with the local, state and federal guidelines for safety, health and environmental compliance.

The height and width of the racks must fit through doors that measure 6'10" (82") tall by 3'2" (38") wide. The surfacing material on the casters must be sturdy enough to be able to handle exposure to chlorine bleach (<50%) during cleaning and disinfection and must not damage epoxy-coated flooring during movement. Racks must be equipped with manifolds that provide for both air and water delivery to each individual tank placed on the rack. Racks must be plumbed such that a single intake water line and air line can be easily attached so the system functions only in a flow-through manner.

Racks must be constructed of at least 316L-grade stainless steel to allow for cleaning and disinfection without corrosion. Tanks for each rack must be interchangeable and of at least three different sizes (i.e. 1.5 liter, 3 liter and 10 liter).  Tanks should be constructed of either clear or colored polycarbonate or other inert plastic material (to prevent plasticizer leaching) that can be washed at high temperature (180ºF) and then autoclaved.  Tanks should have adequate-sized holes in each lid for both air and water lines, plus allowance for provision of food or feed through the lid without opening. Tanks should have an excellent and proven design for self-cleaning of tanks that minimizes the amount of manual tank vacuuming that must be done in between tank changes.

contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance, the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003) ALTERNATE I (OCT 2003)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record “Active”.

(b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR database by ?(Contracting Officer shall insert a date no later than December 31, 2003)????. The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of the SF 30, Amendment of solicitation/Modification of Contract, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in this contract. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Contractor is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(i) Company legal business.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(vi) Date the company was started.

(vii) Number of employees at your location.

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.

(ix) Line of business (industry).

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(End of clause)

The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.

(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an “equal” product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.

(End of provision)


52.219-6     NOTICE OF TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE (JUN 2003)

(a) Definition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-22.  This solicitation is restricted to small businesses, NAICS 332312, Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered. BACKGROUND There are three reservoirs within Ross Lake National Recreation Area.  The NPS offers lake-based recreational opportunities at all three.  This contract will provide docks for two new sites:  At Gorge Lake, we are updating an existing car campground to ADA accessibility standards.  In conjunction with this project we will provide a new dock, which must be fully accessible.  This dock will be in a protected cove, where the lake bottom is probably mud.  We are also considering creating a new trailhead access point on Ross Lake, which is accessible only by boat or foot.  Because Ross has a considerable drawdown, the dock for this site will be out of water ~6 months each winter.  The below-water surface is steep and rocky.  There is typically little or no ice on either lake.  In both cases, the NPS will build reinforced concrete bulkheads after award of this contract. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Contractor shall provide prefabricated floating dock(s) with access bridge(s) built in accordance with the following specifications.  The prefabricated dock for Gorge Lake shall be 20' long by 8' wide attached to one 20' long by 5' wide ADA-accessible access bridge with handrails (CLINs 1 and 2).  In addition, there is an option for the NPS to purchase a second 20' long by 8' wide floating dock attached to one 15' long by 5' wide access bridge with handrails for Ross Lake (CLINs 3 and 4).  The following specifications shall be regarded as minimum standards for the design and construction of the floating dock(s), access bridge(s) and the related components mentioned herein. STANDARD COMPLIANCE When materials or equipment must conform to the standards of organizations such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Underwriter's Laboratories (UL), proof of such conformance shall be submitted to the NPS for approval.  If an organization uses a label or listing to indicate compliance with a particular standard, the label or listing will be acceptable evidence.  In lieu of the label or listing, submit a certificate from an independent testing organization, which is competent to perform the test.  The certificate shall state that the item has been tested in accordance with the specified organization's standard. MATERIALS 1.  Steel:  Structural steel for the dock framing shall be of ¼ inch minimum thickness. Members shall be rolled structural shapes of ASTM A-36 material and galvanized in accordance with ASTM-123 requirements after fabrication. All welds over galvanized material shall be thoroughly cleaned and treated with two coats of cold zinc-rich compound. 2.  Fasteners:  All fasteners shall be Stainless Steel type 18-8 (Grade 304). 3.  Flotation:  Flotation devices shall consist of blow molded, from 6 melt high molecular weight polyethylene shells filled with expandable polystyrene which has a density of no less than one pound per square foot and is expanded inside the shell to eliminate voids and air gaps. Shells shall be highly resistant to impact and UV rays, and unaffected by gasoline, oil, and most chemicals (those prevalent in marina areas). Color: black. Flotation devices shall have a 10-year warranty. 4.  Decking:  Decking shall be 2" X 6" No. 1 grade Douglas Fir #2 or better.  Deck boards shall be ACQ pressure-treated to a minimum retention of .40 lbs./cu. ft.  Wood decking shall be secured to the dock framework with #14 x 2 1/2" oval head and pan head stainless steel deck screws. 5.  Dock edging:  Floating dock shall have wood fendering and vinyl bumper.  Pressure-treated wood fendering shall meet the same minimum treatment standards set forth for wood decking.  Wood fendering shall be minimum 2" x 8" boards and shall be secured to the dock sides with a minimum of two (2) 3/8" X 3-3/4" stainless steel hex head bolts located at 4'-0" maximum on center.  Bolt heads shall be recessed into the fendering to provide a smooth dock edge.  Dock bumper shall be non-marring, non-yellowing, extruded marine grade white vinyl, "Single-P" profile and shall be secured to the dock with broad stainless steel screws located along the top and sides at a maximum of 12" on center.   6.  Cleats:  Cleats shall be ALMAG cast aluminum alloy or hot dipped galvanized steel.  	  Cleats shall be through-bolted to the dock framing and shall withstand a mooring line load of 1500 lbs. in any direction. 7.  Connections:  Floating dock shall have hinged connections to the access bridge. ENGINEERING AND DESIGN The new floating docks are intended to simultaneously support various recreational motor boats up to 25 feet in length.  The docks, fendering system, and cleats shall be designed for these vessels. The anticipated wave and wind factors for the area where the docks will be located are: Longitudinal wave:  3-foot wave height at a 2.5-second period. This shall be taken as the significant wave height (Hs). 	Boat wakes:  2-foot wave height at 2.0-second period.  (Wave height is defined as the vertical distance from the wave's crest to trough, and period is defined as the time required for successive wave crests to pass a given location) 	Current:  .5 knots. (est.) 	Berthing loads: 1.5 knots at 10 degree approaching angle. 	Maximum wind load: 90 mph.  Lake drawn down to dock grounding:  Approximately 4 times per year. Earthquake load:  Zone 3. Dead load shall consist of all materials of the entire dock system plus attachments. At dead load condition, the flotation shall provide 12" of freeboard. Floating dock(s) shall be engineered to support a uniform live load of 70 lbs./sq. ft. Maximum deflection of structures shall be calculated using L/180 where "L" is the span length in decimal inches.  (Example:  120 in. span/180 = .667 inches of deflection) Flotation devices shall be sized and placed to provide a maximum freeboard of eight inches under dead load plus a concentrated load of 400 lbs., applied evenly over a one (1) square foot area, at any location on the walking surface. Additional flotation may be added to support the additional loading caused by gangways and to alleviate unnecessary distortion of the dock. Flotation shall be positively fastened to the structural frame and capable of easy removal and field replacement.  Contractor shall provide engineering and detailed design of the hinged connection between the floating dock system and the NPS-constructed reinforced concrete bulkhead. There shall be no more than a 1/4 in. vertical elevation difference between the gangway deck surface and the deck surface of the dock/ramp to which it is attached, or between any deck surface and the top of the hinged connection between them. The NPS will install the appropriate contractor-provided hardware in the reinforced concrete bulkhead. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE The government may inspect the dock periodically during construction.  Acceptance will occur upon delivery of the dock(s) and bridge(s), and receipt of two sets of construction drawings, with flotation information, design data, and operations and maintenance manuals for parts.

Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this  soliciation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the  solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other  factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate quotes in  respective order:  technical, past performance, price, and delivery time.  The  ability of one source to provide the technical requirements of the system and a  proven past performance of the proposed system is more important than price.  Technical:  All components of the system must be from one source and be of the  same brand name.

Past Performance:  The proposed system is required to have satisfactory proven  performance.  Evaluation will include review of information provided by quoter  and generally obtained information about the system. Price:  The price of the proposed system is required to be fair and reasonable.  Evaluation will  include a review of the system+s capabilities compared to  price most advantageous to the Government.  Because proposed purchase is for an  educational facility, educational discounts, or other discounts, offered will  be reviewed. Delivery Time:  Delivery time should not be delayed due to developmental time  since the technical requirement includes provision that system components do  not require further development in order to obtain operating ability.      Quotations may be in any format but must include:  proposing company+s name,  address and phone;  point of contact+s name, phone and email;  quotation number  and/or date; unit price--price each component separately;  total price;  identify discounts; how long the quote is valid; lead time; shipping terms of  FOB Destination; and warranty information and price.
