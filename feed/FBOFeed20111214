<p style="text-align: left;">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to increase the maximum order amount of contract NNG10AZ19C withCapital Technology Services Inc. (CTSI), pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source. This action will also extend the effective ordering period of thecontract. The Facilities Operations and Maintenance Services (FOMS) bridge contract is anIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with task orders issued on aCost Plus Fixed Fee basis. Quantities ordered under the contract schedule have exceededestimates and it is anticipated that the amount ordered under the contract will reach themaximum order amount on or about January 2012. The government is currently working onawarding a follow-on procurement for FOMS at GSFC which will not be awarded until the endof the calendar year. To avoid a break in service, the Government is increasing thecontract value of contract NNG10AZ19C and extending the ordering period until servicesstart on the follow-on FOMS contract. The current bridge contract supports GSFCsFacilities Management Division by providing the following services: operations,maintenance, and repair of all institutional GSFC facilities and collateral equipment andother related functions such as maintenance, Facilities Operations Console and buildingoperations; mission support to buildings 3/13/14/32; maintenance of uninterruptible powersupply units located throughout the Center; Center High Voltage and Center Power Plantservices; snow removal services; 24/7 hour support and response; institutional planning;and various IDIQ projects to support NASA missions.A break in service poses an unacceptable risk to the support of mission activities. CTSI,as the incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of the on-site facilities and systems andpersonnel to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical services. Aninterruption and restart of the services currently being performed, with a new contractorthat is unfamiliar with the existing facilities and the specific requirements of the FOMScontract, would greatly jeopardize the operation of Goddard facilities. Due to the timeand substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in anothercontractor, CTSI is considered the only contractor that can meet GSFCs needs given theshort period of performance before the award of the FOMS follow-on contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact, Yolanda Williams, email:yolanda.a.williams@nasa.gov, not later than 3:00 pm local time on December 21, 2011. Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination bythe Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<p>The main objective of the contract will be to provide the ODS, NIH and its stakeholders with accurate, reliable, practical, validated, and published chemical analytical methods for selected dietary supplements as directed by the ODS and informed by the AOAC process. The ODS envisions the simultaneous development, optimization, and validation of multiple analytical methods coordinated by the Contractor and guided by a stakeholder informed method prioritization process through the AOAC.

In addition, the Contractor shall subcontract with other laboratories for the performance of collaborative studies, as needed. Therefore, the Contractor may establish a comprehensive overarching organization which subcontracts specific activities to other institutions.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-08-G-0013 with Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) Portsmouth, RI. The order is to qualify modifications to the AQS-22 ALFS system baseline to eliminate obsolete components and create an update to the AQS-22 ALFS system production baseline. The effort required is to update and qualify the Digital Transducer Assembly (TA) using production representative test articles and to produce and submit a part two ECP. Additionally, the effort must result in a production baseline that will not require modification to existing interfaces with the MH-60R helicopter and maintain backward compatibility with legacy ALFS weapon replaceable assemblies (WRAs) and address all Digital TA obsolescence issues identified. The new baseline must comply with the ALFS System Segment Specification (SSS) for the AN/AQS-22, ALFS as allocated to the TA by the Requirements Verification Matrix (RVM). As the sole manufacturer and developer of the ALFS system, IDS is the only known source with the technical data, knowledge and technical experience necessary to perform this effort within the time frame required to meet the Governments needs. For subcontracting opportunities, please contact IDS at (401) 842-4567. See Note 22.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a cost-type Delivery Order with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) for labor, materials, parts, and test and tooling equipment required to return the E-2D Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) unique items to a Ready for Issue (RFI) condition, in support of the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) Program. RFI is defined as that condition allowing the items to perform properly and reliably in an operational environment in a manner they were intended to operate. NGC will utilize its approved sources of supply for the repair of items returned herein and those of its sub tier suppliers. The projected period of performance shall be June 2012 through December 2013. NGSC is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator, and manufacturer of the E-2D AHE aircraft and weapon system and, as such, is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience and data necessary to provide the required supplies and services. In addition, NGSC is the sole Contractor with the data necessary to successfully perform the tasks required to deliver the supplies and services needed to sustain and modify E-2D AHE aircraft and components. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation document exists. See Note 22.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production for the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division has a requirement for the repair and production of AN/SPS-49 Solid State Modulator (SSM) Components, including Solid State High Voltage Switch and Bias Power Supply in accordance with the Statement of Work as follows:  CLIN 0001: Test, Teardown, and Evaluation of the Solid State High Voltage Switch, Part Number 8242921-001; CLIN 0002: Test, Teardown, and Evaluation of the SSM Bias Power Supply, Part Number 8242994-002; Required Delivery Date (RDD) for proposal for repair for CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 shall be 15 days after receipt of Government Furnished Property (GFP).

This solicitation will be issued utilizing other than full and open competition procedures under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), One Source or Limited Sources. An offer will be solicited from Polarity Inc. 11294 Sunshine Park Drive, Rancho Cordova, CA 95742.

The anticipated 5 year, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, Firm-Fixed-Price Contract is for the supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). It has been determined that the Government requirement for this supply can only be met by one company due to the duplication of costs and unacceptable delay which would result in increased risks and seriously jeopardize the Navys Fleet if another source was sought.
 The costs of trying to duplicate this unique knowledge could not be expected to be recouped in competition. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The solicitation will be available for download on or about 03 January 2012. Closing date will be on or about 03 February 2012.
 This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure subject equipment. The POC is Lynn Fleetwood, Code CXMR, at 812-854-1557 or email elizabeth.fleetwood@navy.mil.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered. Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation to be considered. Submitting a bid from the NECO website by clicking on the Submit Bid does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format. It is the responsibility of offerors to download the RFP and to submit offers to the POC at NSWC Crane to be considered.

<p>In Stage 3, the final short-list of offerors will be make presentations to the Architectural-Engineering Council (AEC) and the AEC will hold discussions with each of the short-listed firms. The AEC will not re-score the remaining offerors, but will make its own determination of the most highly qualified team consistent with the announced evaluation criteria and will recommend that offeror for award to the OBO Director. <br /><br />Stage 1 Submission Requirements and Evaluation Criteria.</p>
<p>The assembled content for the Stage 1 portfolio shall be no more than 50 single-faced pages. 8 &frac12;" x 11" format will be counted as one page and 11" x 17" will be counted as two pages. Submissions shall be double-sided, where feasible.

<p>The PSB, which is comprised of representatives from the Overseas Buildings Operations, Department of State, and other government agencies, shall evaluate the submissions. The Board shall establish a short-list of qualified firms. Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer, is not required in this stage. The Lead Designer is the individual or individuals who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept for the project. Consultant and "production firm" (if different from the A/E firm) information should not be included in the Stage 1 portfolio.<br />&emsp;<br />(1) A/E FIRM PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35 points maximum). A/E firms shall submit a portfolio of not more than five projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of 5 pages per project). The narrative shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, image, mission, economic, schedule, maintenance, functional and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. It should comment on the relevance of submitted projects to the OBO project, including site design, architectural design strategy and sustainability. This section of the submission should cite certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence, and provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, email, phone, and fax numbers. A representative floor plan, a site plan, a building section, or other appropriate drawings, and a minimum of two photographs must be included for each project.</p>
<p>(2) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (30 points maximum). Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence. Address their participation in each project. Submit a portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, image, mission, economic, schedule, maintenance, functional, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. Cite any certificates, awards peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with the Past Performance on Design criteria, the Lead Designer shall address their participation in the project.</p>
<p>(3) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (20 points maximum). The Lead Designer (in a maximum of two pages) shall state: the parameters of an overall design philosophy; their approach to the challenge of public architecture and related issues; parameters that may apply in creating an overseas diplomatic presence; and their commitment to integrated and sustainable design.</p>

Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages per person) including education, professional experience, and recognition for design efforts inclusive of the portfolio examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.</p>
<p>The short-listed Lead Designers and their associated A/E Firms will be notified, in writing, and requested to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants for Stage 2 evaluation. Sufficient time will be provided for the Lead Designer and associated offerors to establish its team. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage 1 short-list announcement.</p>
<p>Stage 3 details, and evaluation criteria, will be established along with the Stage 2 short-list announcement.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful offeror must possess, or be eligible to obtain, a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Additionally, the successful offeror selected for contract award must possess, or immediately obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS-approved classified IS for processing classified information. Contractors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Stage 2 submissions.</p>
<p>If a contractor making the Stage 3 short-list does not possess an Interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of 90 calendar days, from the date of sponsorship, will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain the necessary FCL. The Government will not be obligated to extend its competition schedule, if any short-listed sponsored firm has not been issued a FCL. Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements. Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Until short-listed firms have been issued the appropriate FCL, and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents, they will not receive the classified portions of the Stage 3 RFP requirements package.</p>
<p>Certain design team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances. The Department of State may sponsor one uncleared design subcontractor/consultant, at the request of an uncleared short-listed firm. Any other uncleared design team subcontractors/consultants must be sponsored by the short-listed firm, only after that firm receives its own FCL.<br />&emsp;<br />A copy of the Prohibited Countries List, from which offerors may not choose design team members, can be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed in the last paragraph of this announcement. Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" offerors, as defined in the Act. The offeror must complete and submit as part of its qualification package the pamphlet, Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (The pamphlet is attached to this announcement and may also be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this notice.)</p>
<p>This is neither a request for proposal nor a design competition. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541310, $4.5 million average.</p>
<p>Selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104). After the successful offeror has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations concerning level of effort and price.</p>
<p>Offerors that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit the required Stage 1 documents. Firms shall submit six hard copies and one digital, PDF version on CD. The submission shall incorporate tabs to clearly identify the different solicitation requirements. Offerors may find a copy of the SF-330 at the following website: http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6/$file/SF%20330.pdf.</p>
<p>Firms must also submit two copies of a statement of qualifications for purposes of Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 P.L. 99-399 (questionnaire forms are available by e-mail request to Mr. Brian Mulcahy, Contracting Officer, at mulcahybf@state.gov.)</p>
<p>A firm being considered for award must meet the definition of a "United States person" of P.L. 99-399, Section 402 thereof, as follows: (1) be legally organized in the United States more than five years prior to the issuance of a request for proposal; (2) have its principal place of business in the United States; (3) have performed within the U.S. administrative, technical or professional services similar in complexity, type of construction, and value of the project being solicited; (4) employ U.S. citizens in a least 80 percent of principal management positions in the U.S.; and (5) have existing technical and financial resources in the U.S. to perform the contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY; no proposals are being requested at this time. Furthermore, no draft Request for Proposals (RFP) or Statement of Work (SOW) will be available prior to release of the solicitation. The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, VA has a requirement to procure a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) compliant GPS-S Replacement Systems, logistic support, technical support, training, and an operators manual for the artillery target acquisition community.  The GPS-S Replacement System procurement, a Non-Developmental item, intends to enter the DoD acquisition framework at Milestone B.  A contract award is anticipated in March 2012.  Initial Operational Capability for this effort is defined as fielding and training of 2 systems to the Marine Artillery Detachment at Fort Sill, OK.
  Full Operational Capability will be reached upon the fielding and training of the full Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO).  The AAO is a total of 22 systems. 

Using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach, MCSC plans to award one Firm Fixed Priced contract. This procurement will be conducted using full and open competition. Evaluation factors will be set forth in the RFP. The Government intends to release RFP No. M67854-12-R-6001 on or near January 31, 2012, and it will be posted on the internet at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   The online version of the RFP will include all documents of the solicitation package.

The GPS-S Replacement System will provide the capability for Marine sensor sections to provide accurate and timely survey support to target acquisition and fire support agencies across the spectrum of warfare.
  The current system used by Marine artillery surveyors was fielded in 1995 and has become obsolete, heavy, and requires too much time for initialization and navigation through the software Graphical User Interfaces which can be difficult.  In addition, the system is not SAASM compliant and is no longer supported or manufactured by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  CJSI 6140.01 dated 15 November 1998, directs that all GPS Precise Positioning Service users field only SAASM based GPS user equipment after 1 October 2002.  


No hard copy of this RFP will be available. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the RFP. The complete RFP package, including amendments, should be downloaded and reviewed prior to submitting a response.
 The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form as well as a CD submission. It is the responsibility of those responding to the RFP to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the RFP has been issued. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. ALL COMMUNICATION SHALL BE MADE VIA E-MAIL WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICE.

<DESC>&nbsp;<em>Argonne National Laboratory is seeking to award a Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) to a consulting firm ( hereinafter "the firm") with construction safety expertise. The firm will assist and support Argonne's Infrastructure project and construction management functions. Argonne's Infrastructure Program is tasked with managing several dozen construction projects each year. These projects range in cost from $50,000 to $10M. &nbsp;The work to be performed under this proposed contract is to provide construction safety expertise to Argonne and Argonne's many construction subcontractors.<br /></em><em><br />The construction safety documentation required under DOE 40 CFR 851 regulations is substantial and requires significant organizational skills in addition to technical expertise to successfully prepare. The firm will possess professional expertise certified by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals. The firm will assist Argonne in at least two ways: by providing construction safety input during the engineering design phase; and, after contract award, by assisting Argonne's construction contractors (many of whom are small businesses) in preparing the DOE-required safety documentation. The firm will be expected to use Argonne's established construction safety program and modify it to become a substantially more efficient and rapidly implemented system by introducing standardization and databases. This will likely require the firm to take a leadership role in preparing construction contractor documentation to meet Argonne requirements and to present that completed documentation to Argonne for final approval and execution. Typical projects engaged in by the Infrastructure Program include: office and conference space build-out and refurbishment, laboratory and support space build-out and refurbishment, general interior and exterior building repairs, office and laboratory construction, major utility systems construction and modification, MEP and civil construction and landscaping. <br /></em><em><br />The firm will be within a 50 mile radius of Argonne and be able to provide immediate on-site support to Argonne on an as-needed basis. Specific Assignments under the contract will be issued with the understanding that the construction safety support to each project will begin immediately to meet Argonne's needs. Please provide your company's interest in this solicitation by providing a </em>Letter of Intent<em> to propose on this solicitation to the persons listed below.</em>

The Food and Drug Administration Office of Regulatory Affairs (FDA/ORA) is seeking sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, 8(a) certified small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses as well as small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for providing the item described below. All parties may respond to this solicitation.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Two (2) hybrid extraction-cleanup-evaporation systems are required to provide automated extraction, clean-up and concentration for dioxin and furan analyses in matrices that are amenable to pressure liquid extraction technique. One system is to be delivered to the FDA Arkansas Regional Laboratory, Jefferson, AR and the other to the FDA's Kansas District Laboratory, Lenexa, KS.</p>
<p>Both systems must have the ability to simultaneously extract up to six samples, followed by an automated clean-up procedure using various clean-up columns including carbon and completing with a solvent evaporation step directly into a Gas Chromatograph vial insert ready for analyses on a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer. The system shall have the capability to run overnight unattended, after the samples have been placed in extraction cells, with extracts ready for analyses by GS/MS in the morning. Equipment shall be capable of producing 12 samples (2 batches) within a 24 hour period, one during working hours and the other overnight. Equipment must meet recovery criteria set for dioxins, furans and PCBs found in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Method 1613 using matrices such as fish and animal feed. Clean-up columns (such as carbon, alumina, and acid silica gel), obtained from the manufacturer must be free of contamination and cause no interferences (phthalates, etc.) during GC/MS analyses. Each sample in a batch must have its own line from sample introduction through extract evaporation, resulting in no possibility of cross-contamination. Equipment shall have computer controlled extraction/clean-up and evaporation procedure with the ability to monitor differences between samples, such as pressure drops or faulty temperature to assist in troubleshooting poor recoveries. The extraction apparatus shall be able to accommodate various sample sizes ranging from 2 grams to 75 grams. Contractor would also be expected to provide installation, training, warranty, and out-year maintenance.</p>
<p>Funding for this purchase is contingent upon availability of FY12 funds.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
US Department of Interior, Bureau of ReclamationUpper Colorado Region Acquisition Management DivisionSalt Lake City, UT
Subject/Title of this Justification:GRAND VALLEY POWER LINE EXTENSION
1- Office requesting the action:Western Colorado Area Office - Grand Junction
2- Description of proposed action:Sole source acquisition
3- Description of services or supplies needed:The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region proposes to enter into a contract to extend an existing 3-phase, primary overhead distribution line approximately 9,254 feet to the future site of the Horsthief Canyon Native Fish Facility and to provide a 75 kva 277/480 volt 3-phase pole mounted transformer bank and associated meter equipment.
4- Estimated cost and time:$180,000.00Duration to complete - 3 Months from award date.
5- Authority:FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source
5a- Address specifically how the authority applies:State conditions related to the requirement, contractor(s) qualifications; etc.  (Refer to the "Application" and "Limitation" portion of the applicable FAR citation.)
Grand Valley Power (GVP) is the only electric utility servicing the project area and this utility company has a policy that they construct their own power lines with a service is required and requested.  GVP is a non-profit, consumer-owned, cooperative power company.
6- Effort made to obtain offers from multiple sources:There are only two (2) utility companies that provide power to Western Colorado.  The Horsthief Canyon Native Fish Facility (HCNFF) is serviced by GVP.  The other utility company is Xcel Energy.  Due to service area agreements, power to the HCNFF can only be provided by GVP.
7- Description of market research performed:Market research was conducted by Kevin Moran of the Western Colorado Area Office in early 2011.  The results of this research show that GVP is the only entity that can install the necessary power lines due to organizational policy and service agreements.
The policy of GVP excludes any private vendors or other utilities from working on power transmission lines that will be owned by the utility, and they will not provide power via lines that are built by a private vendor; nor will the utility allow any vendor to complete the work necessary to connect to their power grid.
8- Determination of fair and reasonable cost:GVP is a non-profit, consumer owned, cooperative power company.  Costs can be contrasted with other power line work at other locations as a comparative tool for cost per mile.
A complete analysis of all costs and/or previous history will be utilized prior to award. 
The contractor's proposal will be compared against the IGE prior to award.
This will be a firm fixed price contract. 
9- Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competition:
N/A
10- List any sources that have expressed interest in this proposed acquisition:The synopsis of this requirement in FedBizOpps will serve as a market survey.  This requirement will be synopsized in FedBizOpps once the DI-1886 has been approved by Karen Happ.
11- Effort to overcome barriers to competition for future acquisition:Explain what can and will be done to improve our ability to obtain competition for these services or supplies when next required.
In the future, any requirements to service GVP's power transmission lines will need to be contracted through GVP.  The barriers to competition have not been removed, and will likely not be removed.

<a href="mailto:anita.tolliver@aqd.nbc.gov">Point of Contact</a>
<DESC>This Notice is for information purposes only.  In accordance with FAR 8.405-6, the Government has issued Task Order D12PD50848 on a sole source basis to PriceWaterhouse Coopers for a Firm-fixed-price of $274,000 inclusive of a six (6) month base period and one (1) three (3) month option period.  For this requirement, PriceWaterhouseCoopers shall provide recipient reporting support, bureau program completion support and other Recovery Act reporting support.  This requirement is not funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act Funds.  This Task Order was awarded under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), =BFOnly one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized,=BF and is supported in an approved limited-sources justification which is posted the below Notice.
LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APROVAL(IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 8.405-6)
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Program Management FY 12 Support
1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.  
Requiring Agency:  U.S. Department of the Interior1849 C Street N.W.Washington, DC 20240				
Contracting Activity: U.S. Department of the InteriorNational Business Center/Acquisition Services Directorate381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170 2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved. 
This is a limited sources action to award a sole-source contract to PriceWaterHouseCoopers LLP (PwC) against GSA Schedule Contract GS-10F-0466N to provide American Recovery and Reinvestment Act recipient reporting, bureau program completion and other Recovery Act reporting support.  
3.	A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency=BFs Needs (including the estimated value).
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009.  The Department of the Interior received over $2.9 billion in Recovery Act funding for eight Bureaus and Offices, including the Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Geological Survey.  In addition to these Bureaus and Offices receiving Recovery Act funds, the Office of the Inspector General received $15 million to provide oversight of Recovery Act implementation.  The Recovery Act investment funded some 3,900 projects.  At the end of FY 2011, 83% of Interior=BFs Recovery Act projects were substantially completed and 80% of the funds outlayed.  During Fiscal Year 2011, the Department of the Interior made significant progress towards the completion of its Recovery Act program.  During FY 2012, Interior will complete execution of its Recovery Act program.  In addition to monitoring the completion of its Recovery Act projects, Interior must continue to meet its ongoing transparency and accountability requirements.  Interior must continue to submit weekly Financial and Activity Reports.  Interior must ensure that recipients continue to report quarterly to FederalReporting.Gov on their award progress.  In collaboration with the Interior Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Recovery Oversight Office (ROO), Interior will continue its efforts to avoid waste, fraud and abuse.  The Government continues to require continued support in order to undertake all of the responsibilities required by statute for ARRA program management and implementation.Interior=BFs Recovery Act program was primarily construction-oriented in nature.  As such, the actual timeframe for project completion is variable and heavily dependent on weather and other environmental factors.  Until a project is completed, a recipient cannot submit its final invoice and as such, remains subject to the recipient reporting requirements of the Recovery Act.  This award includes a base period and one (1) option period over approximately nine (9) months (December 1, 2011 =BF August 30, 2012) totaling $274,000.00.  The base period is for six (6) months and includes a deliverable to provide transition training in the event the volume of recipients drops to a more manageable level for a government resource to perform recipient reporting activities.  The option is structured to provide an additional single quarter of support.  The tables below outline the recipient reporting deliverables for the base period and option period one (1).

4.	The Authority and Supporting Rationale. 
Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6.  However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of federal supply schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.
The applicable authority permitting to limit sources is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).  As cited in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) =BFOnly one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.=BF  PWC previously provided recipient reporting support, bureau program completion support and other Recovery Act reporting support under Task Order N10PD40298 from April 2010 to November 30, 2011.  The period of performance for Task Order N10PD40298 presumed that the government would no longer require contractor support for recipient reporting, bureau program completion and other Recovery Act reporting support.  However, due to the continued volume of recipients that are required to report and the volume of Recovery Act projects that must still be completed in FY 2012, contractor support continues to be needed.  
Interior=BFs Recovery Act program has been overwhelmingly successful in large part due to the support that PWC has provided.  PWC designed, implemented, analyzed and maintained the program completion dashboards used to measure completion.  PWC has an in-depth knowledge of Interior=BFs entire Recovery Act program including specialized knowledge of the progress and risks of the remaining 17% of the program.  PWC has worked collaboratively with the Interior bureaus and has provided continuity during government leadership transition.  PWC supports all aspects of Interior=BFs recipient reporting program including phone and email outreach to recipients reminding of their obligations to report, monitoring of reporting submissions, and reviews of recipient report data quality.  PWC designed, implemented and maintained the tools used to track recipient reporting compliance and data quality.  As such, PWC staff have a unique and detailed understanding of Interior=BFs recipient reporting tools.  
5.	A Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d).
The amount for the base and option period totals $274,000.00.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d) =BFGSA has already determined the price of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d)=BF.
6.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.
Market Research was not conducted because a new competition would be impracticable due to the substantial learning curve involved in obtaining a new contractor who can provide the recipient reporting support, bureau program completion and other reporting support.  Obtaining a new contractor would not be a cost benefit to the Government as the price to bring in a new contractor would cost significantly more than the total of $274,000.00.
PWC previously provided recipient reporting support, bureau program completion support and other Recovery Act reporting support under Task Order N10PD40298 from April 2010 to November 30, 2011.  The period of performance for Task Order N10PD40298 presumed that the government would no longer require contractor support for recipient reporting, bureau program completion and other Recovery Act reporting support.  However, due to the continued volume of recipients that are required to report and the volume of Recovery Act projects that must still be completed in FY 2012, contractor support continues to be needed.  Additionally, contractor support is needed until the recipient reporting work can be transitioned to the federal government to complete.  This requirement does include transition activities, so that this work can soon be completed by the government. 
7.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification.
PWC previously provided recipient reporting support, bureau program completion support and other Recovery Act reporting support under Task Order N10PD40298 from April 2010 to November 30, 2011.  The period of performance for Task Order N10PD40298 presumed that the government would no longer require contractor support for recipient reporting, bureau program completion and other Recovery Act reporting support.   However, the need continues for this contractor support and PwC has been the only contractor to perform this ARRA recipient reporting support work for the DOI in the past.  Only PwC can perform this continued support because the continued support will only be for a relatively short period of time and will include transition activities to prepare the federal government to undertake these tasks themselves and PwC possesses the specific knowledge required to perform this ARRA Recipient Reporting support and all transition the work to the government successfully.  It would not be feasible or beneficial to the Government to change contractors for a limited timeframe of nine (9) months.  
8.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers that Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made.
A new competition would be impracticable due to the substantial learning curve involved in obtaining a new contractor who can provide the additional work as this work will only be provided for a six (6) month base period with transition activities and one (1) possible three (3) month option period for a total period of performance of nine (9) months.  Obtaining a new contractor would not be a cost benefit to the Government as the price to bring in a new contractor would cost significantly more than the total price of $274,000.00.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html.<BR><BR>Contractor is responsible to refuel equipment before, during, and after the lease period. Fuel must be CARB compliant in accordance with the attached PWS. This is a change from previously posted requirements.<BR><BR>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor is responsible to refuel equipment before, during, and after the lease period.  Fuel must be CARB compliant in accordance with the attached PWS.  This is a change from previously posted requirements.<BR><BR>

The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a synopsis, NOT a solicitation. <br /><br />CBP intends to award a sole source contract to William Data Systems for annual software maintenance for previously purchased licenses for ARINC (Implex, Exigence, and Routeview) software to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the National Data Center (NDC). The use of this product is tied to mission critical CBP applications. <br /><br />The software is used within CBP's distributed and mainframe environments for maintaining data residing at CBP. The product has been used for several years within CBP to meet these requirements. During this time CBP has created many mission critical applications which are dependent on this software. <br /><br />CBP has a requirement for maintenance of software. This requirement creates the need for software maintenance of products associated with CBP distributed and mainframe environments. William Data Systems has the ability to provide ongoing software maintenance support for the products. William Data Systems is the only manufacturer and seller who can provide the required software maintenance for the current ARINC software licenses. They do not have any distributors and will allow no other vendor to sell their products.
<p>This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to be used for consideration of future requirements by no later than December 29, 2011 at 9am. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and an RFP will not be issued. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted; only email responses will be accepted.</p>

If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.<br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items with _____ days after date of contract award.<br /><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br /><br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />FAR 52.211-16-VARIATION IN QUANTITY (APR 1984)</p>
<p>(a) A variation in the quantity of any item called for by this contract will not be accepted unless the variation has been caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or allowances in manufacturing processes, and then only to the extent, if any, specified in paragraph (b) below.</p>
<p>(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:</p>
<p>10 Percent increase</p>

	52.232-18	AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)
Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

	52.232-19	AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR (APR 1984)
Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2012. The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2012, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

52.232-34	PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER - OTHER THAN CENTRAL 				CONTRACTOR REGISTRY (MAY 1999)	
	(a) Method of payment.	
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 
(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by the date and time specified for receipt of quotes. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).
(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.
(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.
(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).
(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).
(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.
(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.
(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).
(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.
(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.
(End of clause)
	52.241-2	ORDER OF PRECEDENCE -- UTILITIES (FEB 1995)
In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this contract (including the specifications) and any rate schedule, rider, or exhibit incorporated in this contract by reference or otherwise, or any of the Contractor's rules and regulations, the terms of this contract shall control.
(End of Clause)
	52.241-3	SCOPE AND DURATION OF CONTRACT (FEB 1995)

(c) The Contractor shall provide the Government with one complete set of rates, terms, and conditions of service that are in effect as of the date of this contract and any subsequently approved rates.
(d) The Contractor shall be paid at the applicable rate(s) under the tariff and the Government shall be liable for the minimum monthly charge, if any, specified in this contract commencing with the period in which service is initially furnished and continuing for the term of this contract. Any minimum monthly charge specified in this contract shall be equitably prorated for the periods in which commencement and termination of this contract become effective.
(End of Clause)
52.241-4	CHANGE IN CLASS OF SERVICE (FEB 1995)
(a) In the event of a change in the class of service, such service shall be provided at the Contractor's lowest available rate schedule applicable to the class of service furnished.
(b) Where the Contractor does not have on file with the regulatory body approved rate schedules applicable to services provided, no clause in this contract shall preclude the parties from negotiating a rate schedule applicable to the class of service furnished.
(End of Clause)
52.241-5	CONTRACTOR'S FACILITIES (FEB 1995)
(a) The Contractor, at its expense, unless otherwise provided for in this contract, shall furnish, install, operate, and maintain all facilities required to furnish service hereunder, and measure such service at the point of delivery specified in the Service Specifications. Title to all such facilities shall remain with the Contractor and the Contractor shall be responsible for loss or damage to such facilities, except that the Government shall be responsible to the extent that loss or damage has been caused by the Government's negligent acts or omissions.
(b) Notwithstanding any terms expressed in this clause, the Contractor shall obtain approval from the Contracting Officer prior to any equipment installation, construction, or removal. The Government hereby grants to the Contractor, free of any rental or similar charge, but subject to the limitations specified in this contract, a revocable permit or license to enter the service location for any proper purpose under this contract. This permit or license includes use of the site or sites agreed upon by the parties hereto for the installation, operation, maintenance, and repair of the facilities of the Contractor required to be located upon Government premises. All applicable taxes and other charges in connection therewith, together with all liability of the Contractor in construction, operation, maintenance and repair of such facilities, shall be the obligation of the Contractor.
(c) Authorized representatives of the Contractor will be allowed access to the facilities on Government premises at reasonable times to perform the obligations of the Contractor regarding such facilities. It is expressly understood that the Government may limit or restrict the right of access herein granted in any manner considered necessary (e.g., national security, public safety).
(d) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, at its expense, remove such facilities and restore Government premises to their original condition as near as practicable within a reasonable time after the Government terminates this contract. In the event such termination of this contract is due to the fault of the Contractor, such facilities may be retained in place at the option of the Government for a reasonable time while the Government attempts to obtain service elsewhere comparable to that provided for hereunder.
(End of Clause)
52.241-6	SERVICE PROVISIONS (FEB 1995)
(a) Measurement of service.
(1) All service furnished by the Contractor shall be measured by suitable metering equipment of standard manufacture, to be furnished, installed, maintained, repaired, calibrated, and read by the Contractor at its expense. When more than a single meter is installed at a service location, the readings thereof may be billed conjunctively, if appropriate. In the event any meter fails to register (or registers incorrectly) the service furnished, the parties shall agree upon the length of time of meter malfunction and the quantity of service delivered during such period of time. An appropriate adjustment shall be made to the next invoice for the purpose of correcting such errors. However, any meter which registers not more than 1 percent slow or fast shall be deemed correct.
(2) The Contractor shall read all meters at periodic intervals of approximately 30 days or in accordance with the policy of the cognizant regulatory body or applicable bylaws. All billings based on meter readings of less than 30 days shall be prorated accordingly.

RATING SCALE 

The following Rating Scale provides the definitions for the Past Performance ratings to be 
assessed: 

E  EXCEPTIONAL 
Based on the Offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the 
Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit. 
Contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which 
corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were highly effective. 

 V  VERY GOOD 
Based on the Offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit. 
Contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problem(s) for 
which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were effective. 

S  SATISFACTORY 
Based on the Offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has met 
contractual requirements. Contractual performance contains some minor 
problem(s) for which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor appear or 
where satisfactory. 

M  MARGINAL 
Based on Offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has not met 
some contractual requirements. Contractual performance reflects a serious 
problem for which either the contractor has not yet identified correction 
action(s), or the proposed corrective action(s) appear only marginally effective 
or were not fully implemented. 

U  UNSATIFACTORY 
Based on Offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror 
will successfully perform the required effort. Past performance has not met 
most contractual requirements, and recovery did not occur or was not in a 
timely manner. Contractual performance contains serious problem(s) for which 
the contractor's corrective action(s) appear or were ineffective.

In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.

This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br><br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

The information on the equipment should mirror the information on the Purchase Order. The written notification shall identify any discrepancies between the equipment and the Purchase Order. Equipment received that indicates obvious misuse, cannibalization or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage are considered exclusions and will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Over and above work outside the direction of the AFTO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as "over-and-above". In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with Purchase Order Number, Line Item Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, NSN, and Serial Number. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipping, handling and storage. Preservation and protection shall be provided to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one (1) year.

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation WITH estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost Not-to-Exceed (NTE) quotes may be submitted for consideration.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that will evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of utilizing advanced technologies and procedural improvements to reduce delays and increase the efficiency and safety of air traffic movements at the Cape Town, King Shaka (Durban), and O.R. Tambo (Johannesburg) international airports in South Africa.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, demand for air traffic services in South Africa has continued to increase alongside increased levels of international trade and sustained economic growth. As demand for air traffic services in South Africa continues to grow, the Grantee and the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) will need to find ways to increase the efficiency of air traffic services at airports with limited terrain while continuing to maintain world-class safety standards.</p>
<p>As a result, the Grantee and ACSA are working together to explore the feasibility of using advanced technologies, such as state-of-the-art radar, communications, and navigation systems, and procedural improvements to increase airside capacity in South Africa. Initially, they would like to deploy these airside capacity enhancements at the Cape Town, King Shaka, and O.R. Tambo international airports. Once the airside capacity enhancements have been successfully deployed at South Africa's three main airports, the Grantee and ACSA expect to roll them out at other airports throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will: determine the current (baseline) airside capacity at each airport; recommend technologies and procedural improvements to maximize the airside capacity of each airport; evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of the proposed airside capacity enhancements; review the existing procurement practices at the Grantee and ACSA, recommend improvements that would help to attract more bids from potential suppliers, and define performance specifications for the recommended airside capacity enhancements; and provide an implementation plan for the recommended airside capacity enhancements.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $758,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM local (South Africa) time, on January 30, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Public-private partnerships are increasingly critical to producing effective, sustainable development outcomes. USAID has been a pioneer in public-private partnerships (PPPs), and has helped create billions of dollars in partnerships over the last decade. In its recent peer review of US foreign assistance efforts, the OECD's Development Assistance Committee noted that, "since the creation of the Global Development Alliance in 2001, the US has been a leader in promoting public-private partnerships. These increasingly go beyond corporate philanthropy to address core business interests." <br /><br />The Global Partnerships Division (GP) in the Office of Innovation and Development Alliances (IDEA) is responsible for providing the overall leadership of the Agency's partnership efforts, many of which are established as Global Development Alliances (GDAs). GP focuses on two key areas: establishing high-impact partnerships in a select number of issue areas and assisting Bureaus, Offices, and Missions across the Agency in building their own partnership capacity. The partnerships pursued and managed directly by GP are focused on issue areas that are cutting edge frontiers in development, global priorities for USAID, and "Agency-wide goods" that don't fit easily into the missions of other Bureaus. Secondly, GP helps build the Agency's overall partnership capacity by providing thought leadership on PPPs; advising other Bureaus, Offices, and Missions on the partnerships they are pursuing, establishing, and managing; providing training and technical assistance on PPPs and private sector engagement; overseeing a community of practice; assisting with legal and policy issues related to PPPs; and helping to track and coordinate partnerships across the Agency. Two teams, Strategic Partnerships and Advisory Services, address these areas respectively.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Advisor for Strategic Partnerships is a member of IDEA/GP and will report to the Chief of USAID's Global Partnerships Division, possibly through the Team Leader for Strategic Partnerships depending on the incumbent's seniority. The Senior Advisor is primarily responsible for sourcing and delivering for Senior Management signature (at least 1-3 in the first year) high-impact and strategic partnerships related to Agency and GP priorities. Each of these partnerships will be expected to achieve significant, sustainable development outcomes faster or at a lower cost than standard USAID practice. To that end, the incumbent will be required to have a proven track record of conceptualizing, developing, managing, awarding or overseeing grants, contracts, or public-private partnership activities. The incumbent will also serve as an interface between the Division and one or more of the Agency's regional or pillar bureaus (please visit www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/).</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that IDEA/GP has a highly-qualified Senior Advisor for Partnerships for the Office of Innovation and Development Alliances, Global Partnerships Division team that will fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position. The following duties and responsibilities reflect the typical duties expected of the Senior Advisor for Partnerships, however the work assignments will also be subject to workload and IDEA priorities.</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>Establishing and Managing Public-Private Partnerships. The incumbent is primarily responsible for establishing (i.e., design, negotiate, close/award) strategic and high impact partnerships related to Agency and GP priorities, and for managing these and other existing partnerships. This responsibility will require the incumbent to proactively identify potential strategic resource partners and establish the necessary relationships where they do not already exist; negotiate and establish partnerships; and ensure that partnerships are successfully implemented. The incumbent will be expected to comply with USAID policies and procedures related to contracts and grants, project design, management, evaluation and reporting. The incumbent will be required to identify and develop (at least 3) major strategic public-private partnership building opportunities and highlight constraints that can be overcome by policy, legislative, or other initiatives, working in collaboration within the Agency and with developing countries or other development partners. These strategic partnerships must represent a significant breakthrough in development in terms of scope and commitment which will be sustained over the long-term without USG support. These partnerships must align with the priorities of the Office. S/he will also prepare briefing materials, trip reports, and meeting and periodic read-outs on public-private building activities.</p>
<p>Provide thought leadership on public-private partnerships. The incumbent is expected to maintain expertise in the field of public-private partnership, and serve as a resource for GP and the Agency on this topic. S/he should be able to provide thoughtful analysis and advice on: different models of partnership and when to use them; how to improve USAID and GP's ability to engage partners, and to develop and implement strategic public-private partnerships; how to effectively monitor, leverage, and evaluate partnerships; issues and areas that hold promise for public-private partnership; and future trends related to public-private partnerships in international development.</p>
<p>Assist Bureaus, Offices, and Missions in developing and managing public-private partnerships. The Global Partnership (GP) division is set up with two teams, Advisory Services and Strategic Partnerships. The incumbent will be assigned to the GP Strategic Partnership team and may be tasked occasionally to support the functions of the Advisory Services team. The incumbent may also be asked to contribute to reviews of Country Development Cooperation Strategies and other planning and strategy documents to ensure that documents reflect state-of-the-art thinking about the role that public-private partnerships and private-sector engagement can play in development.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that will evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of utilizing advanced technologies and procedural improvements to reduce delays and increase the efficiency and safety of air traffic movements at the Cape Town, King Shaka (Durban), and O.R. Tambo (Johannesburg) international airports in South Africa.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, demand for air traffic services in South Africa has continued to increase alongside increased levels of international trade and sustained economic growth. As demand for air traffic services in South Africa continues to grow, the Grantee and the Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) will need to find ways to increase the efficiency of air traffic services at airports with limited terrain while continuing to maintain world-class safety standards.</p>
<p>As a result, the Grantee and ACSA are working together to explore the feasibility of using advanced technologies, such as state-of-the-art radar, communications, and navigation systems, and procedural improvements to increase airside capacity in South Africa. Initially, they would like to deploy these airside capacity enhancements at the Cape Town, King Shaka, and O.R. Tambo international airports. Once the airside capacity enhancements have been successfully deployed at South Africa's three main airports, the Grantee and ACSA expect to roll them out at other airports throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will: determine the current (baseline) airside capacity at each airport; recommend technologies and procedural improvements to maximize the airside capacity of each airport; evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of the proposed airside capacity enhancements; review the existing procurement practices at the Grantee and ACSA, recommend improvements that would help to attract more bids from potential suppliers, and define performance specifications for the recommended airside capacity enhancements; and provide an implementation plan for the recommended airside capacity enhancements.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $758,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM local (South Africa) time, on January 30, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The Navigation Services, Lighting System Team (AJW-9142) has a requirement to develop and procure 400V Semi-Flush Flasher Light Unit (SFFLU) that meets Specification FAA-E-2998 to continue to maintain the operational safety of aircraft during approach and landing operation in Category one through three (CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III) approaches. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source contract to ADB Airfield Solutions, 977 Gahanna Parkway, Columbus, Ohio 43230.  
The Contractor will modify its current 400V Commercial-Off the Shelf (COT) design and verify it meets the FAA-E-2998 specification. This new 400V SFFLU will become part of the ALSF-2/MALSR operational baseline; replacing the existing 2000V SFFLU and providing visual guidance during precision approaches.  
ADB Airfield Solutions has prior experience in manufacturing a portion of the 400V Flasher System that is commercially available and is currently in use in the National Airspace System.  
This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal. A full and open competition is not available for this procurement. If your firm does not agree with the single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing similar services and the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.   All responses to this announcement must be directed to Dave Keehan, Contracting Officer (202)267-4057, dave.keehan@faa.gov or Ndubuisi Nnorom, (202) 493-4661, ndubuisi.nnorom@faa.gov by 3:00 P.M.

<DESC>This Request for Information is being amended as follows:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing date is hereby extended until 4:30PM EST, 03 January 2012.<br />2.&nbsp; Unclassified information available upon request includes: the FMU-139C/B Performance Spec PMA201-03-003A and the FMU-139C/B Fuze Design Control Drawing 3179AS971.<br />3.&nbsp; To provide clarifications and responses to questions received via Attachment 0001 to this posting.<br /><br />Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request For Information (RFI). The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) is seeking information from industry on innovative concepts for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This RFI is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for potential future competition. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. <br /><br /><strong>General Description:</strong>The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139 is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to evaluate technologies and identify potential technology insertion opportunities to facilitate an FMU-139 fuze upgrade process through an evolutionary upgrade approach. As a result of this RFI, the Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources in the form of a concept summary paper containing a description of technical data defining proposed upgrade concepts. The concept summary paper shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the concept and development methodology could satisfy below stated requirements. Each concept summary paper should include a top level description of the proposed upgrade concepts, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, scope of development effort, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed concepts including key subsystems, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for the proposed concepts. FMU-139 Fuze upgrade concepts shall address ability to maintain current integration capability with the F/A-18A+/C/D/E/F and the AV-8B fixed wing aircraft. Desired upgrade concepts include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Hardened target capability (threshold = 5,000 PSI target, Objective = 15,000 PSI target). <br />&bull; Serial Data Interface (SDI) technology to enable communication between fuze and aircraft Operational Flight Program.<br />&bull; An in-line or other electronic design. Of special interest would be a design to minimize the number of moving parts and electro-explosive devices in the fuze. Reduction in overall part and assembly counts in the fuze structure and circuit card assemblies with the desired result of improved fuze producability and reliability. <br />&bull; Replacement of current retard and impact sensors with any number of low power sensors including, but not limited to, piezoelectric sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, rolleron devices, and investigation of the sensor designs currently used in the automotive industry. Of special interest would be the speed and consistency of detection timing, as well as producability and reliability improvements.<br />&bull; Detonator Improvements, including the use of a possible replacement material for both the Lead Azide and Lead Styphnate ultimately leading to the qualification of a lead-free detonator.<br />&bull; Front panel switch improvement or replacement, to improve upon the producability, reliability, and aging concerns that have been experienced.<br />&bull; Post-impact intelligent fuzing, allowing for fuze reaction to terminal impact conditions.<br />&bull; Variable output fuzing for initiation of selectable output weapons.<br />&bull; Environmental Sensing concept to prevent fuze detonation until external conditions are consistent with the intended arming environment conditions. <br />&bull; Fuzes that can respond to post-release instructions from the aircraft. Of interest would be a fuze that could disarm, disable, or self-destruct after it has already armed based on input from the aircraft or other external source. <br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons.
<p><strong>Responses:</strong>Responses to this RFI will be used for information and planning purposes only. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>Determination and Findings for Labor Hour Contract<br /><br />In accordance with the following Determination and Findings and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.601, 16.602, 12.207(b)(1)(ii)(A,) and 12.207(b)(2), use of a labor hour task order is the most appropriate contract type for the requirement for employee and labor relations consulting services for the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI).<br /><br />Findings<br /><br />Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 16.601(c) and (d) and 16.601, 16.602, 12.207(b)(1)(ii)(A,) and 12.207(b)(2)], I hereby find that:<br /><br />1. No other contract type is suitable because the unpredictability of the necessary employee/labor relations services does not allow for accurate deliverables and/or estimation of level of effort.
<p>2. Market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by utilizing the Small Business Administration's small business dynamic search engine. This market research tool revealed that two or more small business firms are capable of providing services, thus adequate competition should encourage reasonable pricing from offerors. Additionally, research of published price lists revealed hourly rates for similar consulting services.</p>
<p>3. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because the employee/labor relations needs can vary drastically due to unforeseen circumstances. The variable nature of the elements within this requirement prevents accurate estimation of levels of effort and anticipated costs.</p>
<p>4. The requirement has been structured to minimize the use of labor hour requirements. This has been accomplished by establishing a ceiling for the labor hour pricing.</p>
<p>5. Pursuant to FAR 12.207(b)(2)(iv), for future acquisitions of the same requirements, use of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts will be maximized by tracking labor hours utilized for performance of this task order as a potential fixed-price pricing element in future procurements.</p>
<p>6. There will be adequate government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by the Contracting Officer's Representative. The COR will monitor labor hour expenditures to ensure efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used.</p>
<p>7. The ceiling price cited in paragraph (e) of the clause at FAR 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and- Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, which will be included in any resulting contract in accordance with FAR 32.111(a)(7), will be established in the contract schedule based on the best estimate of the number of hours required to perform the contract. Any change in the ceiling price will only be authorized upon a determination, documented in the contract file that it is in the best interest of the procuring agency to make that change.</p>
<p>Determination</p>
<p>Based on the above findings, I hereby determine that use of a labor hour contract is the most suitable contract type for this requirement in accordance with FAR 16.601(d) and 12.207(b)(1)(ii)(A)].</p>

<DESC>Original Synopsis Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Seattle District, intends to issue a solicitation for major repair of the American Lake Community Center, Bldg 8085, located on North Fort Lewis, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA. The NAICS code for this project is 236220 with a small business size standard of $33,500,000. The FSC is Z162. This is a total small business set-aside. The successful contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, and equipment<br>necessary to affect major repairs to this 36,502 square foot structure, originally built in 1970 as a Non-Commissioned Officers Open Mess. The building consists of a 30,401 square foot main level with a 6,100 square foot lower level and is constructed of slab on grade (except at the lower level ceiling), concrete floors, tilt-up concrete wall systems and a low slope roof on steel beam and column and metal bar joists. The floor system over the lower level is cast-in-place concrete composite beam/slab. This project provides for an extensive interior<br>demolition and remodel of all existing failed and/or failing systems as well as extensive ADA code compliance upgrades. Major work will include ACM and LbP abatement, replacement of lighting, power and communication systems, addition of mass notification system, replacement of the fire suppression system, replacement of interior doors, frames and movable walls, replacement of existing storefront window systems, new automatic entry system and new architectural finishes (paint, flooring, ceilings) throughout. This project will be constructed to achieve<br>LEED Certification from the U. S. Green Building Council. The Government intends to award a single firm-fixed price construction contract resulting from this solicitation. The magnitude of construction for this project is more than $10,000,000. The solicitation package will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities on or about 25 July 2011. Pre-proposal conference/site visit will be announced in the solicitation. Interested parties may download the<br>solicitation, specifications and any drawings from the FedBizOpps website. Amendments will also be posted at the FedBizOpps website. All contractors proposing on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of the contract. The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov. You are encouraged to register as soon as possible.

       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
 
   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.
 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin
 
	
	
	
	
	
 
     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]
 
     [ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.
 
     [ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
 
   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
 
       (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
 
     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
 
     (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.
 
       [  ] TIN is not required because:
