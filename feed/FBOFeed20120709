<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for preclinical drug development services. It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made under Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts for a period of six years. The estimated start date is June 2013. The solicitation will be issued under full and open competition; however, the Government anticipates making 50% of awards to small businesses. The applicable NAICS Code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>DPI aims to help bridge the gap of time and resources in early development phases for new drugs to treat human diseases. DPI programs that will utilize these services include, but are not limited to, the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) program, to assist academic scientists, non-profit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies working on developing novel therapies for unmet medical needs.<br />&nbsp;<br />The DPI business model is to operate as a collaborative partner for small molecule and biologics drug development, generating data that allows drug candidates to move through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an Investigational New Drug (IND) is filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For certain drug development programs, DPI will support its candidate development up to human phase IIB studies if determined by DPI management team as necessary to achieve the mission. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from DPI and other NIH institutes. The DPI R&amp;D operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of in-house staff and partners, who may be the drug originators, to identify technical areas best suited for outsourcing, and utilize contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program. Each drug development program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment. DPI programs use the "IND-driven, question-based" drug development approach. A DPI Project Manager is responsible for the overall planning, executing, and reporting of the program.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The services to be performed under these contracts will only include preclinical drug discovery and development activities. It will not include clinical studies involving human subjects. The required services fall into the following four task areas: (1) Medicinal Chemistry for Lead Optimization, (2) In Vitro Pharmacological profiling and ADME and Toxicology (ADMET) Testing, (3) In vivo DMPK, Toxicology, and Disease Animal Model Development, and (4) Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC). DPI intends to make multiple awards for each task area. Offerors may propose services in any one or more task areas. <br /><br /><strong>POINT OF CONTACT INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>Kelli Broda, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0332, Fax (301) 480-3432, E-mail brodak@mail.nih.gov.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES</strong></p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP). The RFP will be made available electronically on or about 15 calendar days after the date of this notice. No paper copies will be available. Proposals will be due on or about October 1, 2012. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP and for routinely checking the internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Bio-Rad), 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, California 94547-1804 to procure maintenance and repair services for equipment manufactured by Bio-Rad.</p>
<p>The services must meet the requirements in the attached files.</p>
<p>This is a follow-on requirement. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The NHGRI, NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Investigators at NISC use Bio-Rad's thermocyclers to amplify segments of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. These thermocyclers are critical in the preparation of samples before they are loaded on the DNA sequencers. NISC runs these thermocyclers 24 hours a day, 6 days a week. Maintenance and upkeep of the equipment is essential because it must be in proper running order to maintain productivity at NISC. Failure of this equipment would cause a delay in process down the manufacturing production line.</p>
<p>This sole source determination is based on the fact that Bio-Rad is the sole manufacturer for these instruments and parts and Bio-Rad does not authorize any third party service provider to maintain and repair the instruments. The use of unauthorized parts, maintenance, or repairs could invalidate the equipment warranty.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>1. All maintenance service shall be furnished between the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM, Monday through Friday, excluding locally observed and Bio-Rad observed holidays.<br />2. During the period of coverage under this agreement for tetrad base units, the entire system is covered including the power supply.<br />3. Full on-site service agreements offer unlimited on-site repair visits, including parts, labor and travel expenses, during the service agreement coverage period. One (1) scheduled preventative maintenance visit to Equipment Location. The Bio-Rad field service engineer will inspect the defective parts and correct (if applicable), clean, lubricate, adjust and exercise the instrument in all of its operational modes to ensure continuing optimum performance.<br />4. Mail-in service agreements include unlimited mail-in service repairs during the coverage period. Loaner instruments are provided free of charge pending availability at the time of service. In most cases, loaner instruments are available and will be shipped using overnight service. Upon request, one (1) preventative maintenance is included during the coverage period. Loaner instruments are not included free of charge during preventive maintenance. Under the terms of this agreement, the customer is responsible for shipping the instrument in need of service to the Bio-Rad Service Center, and Bio-Rad is responsible for shipping the instrument back to the customer following servicing.<br />5. Replacement parts furnished as part of maintenance Service rendered hereunder shall be new, used or rebuilt at Bio Rad's sole discretion. Replaced parts removed from Covered Equipment in the course of maintenance Service shall become the exclusive property of Bio-Rad.<br />6. Service, replacement parts or increase in service time if in Bio-Rad's sole discretion, required as a result of damage due to delay of notice of malfunction, fire, water, theft, accident, abuse, neglect, misuse, power failure, fluctuation in the power supply, improper air conditioning or humidity control or any cause not attributable to ordinary wear and tear.</p>
<p><br />Government Responsibilities<br />1. The Government will provide Bio-Rad personnel access to the equipment when service is required. <br />2. The Government will cooperate with Bio-Rad personnel so that service can be performed efficiently and without interruption.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />The Contractor shall provide a summary report of its action after a repair and/or preventive maintenance inspection.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements<br />NISC is responsible for inspection and acceptance of the work. If the work is a repair, the equipment must demonstrate continuous performance.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is $19.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 (May 18, 2012). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis no later than July 16, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>

Responses may be submitted electronically Deirdre Lyons at deirdre.lyons@nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Dawn Trudeau
<DESC>Statement of Work Introduction The existing Mid-Continent Region (MCR) Time & Project tracking database system is currently comprised of Microsoft Access databases that allow staff to code their time using established time codes within the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) and to maintain the status of a variety of ongoing projects in the MCR.  The databases are linked together within the =BFTime=BF database to allow users to code their time on a more granular level than allowed by OSM=BFs current =BFQuickTime=BF system.  Both databases contain a variety of established reports that managers or timekeepers can use for encoding into OSM=BFs QuickTime system, reviewing time spent on individual projects, along with a variety of other uses. The databases have been upgraded through various versions of MS Access as well as operating systems.  The maintenance and security needs require the systems to be updated to and revised to make them more useful on-site at the MCR headquarters, as well as being able to be used at the regional offices and perhaps nationwide.  It is conceivable that this project would be arrayed in conjunction with the specific needs of the other regional offices and end up serving an even greater need with a wider scope.        Overview Redevelop or upgrade several access databases that are considered legacy software under the Windows 2007 Operating System.  The redevelopment of the applications will use Microsoft SQL databases with web based front ends.  The redevelopment must be scalable and transportable to other portions of OSM and systems through coordination with the OSM Business Council and the OSM Development Team. The new application(s) will require innovative use of office automation tools and data sharing utilizing Microsoft technologies, ASP.Net, SharePoint 2010, InfoPath, and SQL 2008, for the redevelopment these database systems with a web front end and a SQL backend.  Programmer should be knowledgeable in requirements gathering, database design, and web application programming along with the integration of these technologies with SharePoint 2010.   Creation of reporting functions and legacy data integration is also required. Work The work involved in this proposal consists of the development of a turnkey solution to replace MCR=BFs current time and project tracking database system folowing the guidelines outlined in the overview section above and the additional criteria listed below: =BFDevelopment of a SQL 2008 database instance, or the setup and administration of a SQL 2008 database instance to house the raw data. =BFCreation of the ASP.NET web based front end for input and administration as well as report generation. =BFDevelopment of a simple user guide for administrative and user functions.  (The product will be a turnkey solution that will be managed and maintained inhouse with no further contractor input when the job is complete) A start up meeting will be setup to to go over: =BFReview of the current database(s) structure, relationships, and currently available reports/forms =BFAdditional new reports or other needs not reflected in the current system.. Note: a copy of the current database(s) will be made available for review, sans data, upon request. The re-write of this system will be done following the =BFOSM Enterprise Software Development Policy=BF (appendix A), and the =BFOSM ASP.Net Security Best Practices=BF document (appendix B) as outlined by the OSM Development Team, in order ensure consistency and security among OSM=BFs internal applications. OSM may also identify operational problems and anomalies with the current database system(s) and request the contractor to analyze the problems, identify solutions and estimate the time required to solve each problem.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with OSM Subject Matter Experts (SME) to ensure that the proposed solution will meet the business needs of OSM.  OSM will approve selected solutions on a case-by-case basis. Professional services agreement All software developed by employees or contractors of OSM using OSM=BFs resources is the exclusive property of OSM. This also includes all software developed using personal resources that was commissioned by OSM. Selection/Rating Criteria The selection of the contractor will be made on the basis of the following rating criteria: oResponsivness to client (OSM) oPrice oPast Performance oTimeliness of project start and completion

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, intends to issue a solicitation to acquire professional services to obtain data collection and analysis from a field operational experiment (FOE), to assess driver adaptation to vehicle-based crash warning and avoidance products based on long-term exposure in a naturalistic driving environment. The primary objectives of the FOE are to assess the safety impact and determine driver acceptance of crash warning and avoidance systems. Participants in the FOE will be recruited to drive instrumented vehicles equipped with crash warning and avoidance products in place of their personal cars, driving wherever, whenever, and however they choose. The driving is thereby largely unmanaged by the Contractor and derives, instead, from the personal mobility needs of the individual participants. The primary deliverables from the FOE will be a dataset that captures driver-vehicle performance and the driving environment, and an analysis of this dataset. <br /><br />Objective and subjective data will need to be collected and analyzed to meet the FOE objectives. Objective data are obtained based on observable evidence, undistorted by emotion or personal bias of the FOE participants. Objective data generally consist of numerical and video data that capture host vehicle states and maneuvers, surrounding traffic, system operation, and driver behavior. The Contractor will acquire/lease the vehicles and will provide and install data acquisition systems to collect numerical and video data.
<p>Subjective data are collected to obtain driver background information before participation in the FOE, and to assess driver perception and opinion of the crash warning and avoidance products in terms of ease of use and learning, willingness to use, and safety impact after their participation in the FOE.<br />This will be a Full and Open competitive acquisition conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 for this acquisition with a small business size standard of 500 for the number of employees. The estimated release date of the solicitation will be on or about May 15, 2012. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the issuance of the solicitation. The solicitation will be issued utilizing the following contract types: Firm-Fixed-Price and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee. <br />The performance period of this contract will be sixteen months from date of contract award. The contract will include a twelve month option period if exercised by the Government, which will extend the performance period to twenty-eight months from date of contract award.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP or amendments will not be available. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available in electronic format only from the Government-wide Point of Entry at the Federal Business Opportunities website at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue a solicitation in March 2012 for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell Lock in Massena, New York. The final design is not yet complete at this time; however, the work site is now dewatered and accessible for inspection and this will be the only time prior to award of a contract that the entire site will be fully accessible. The Corporation plans to conduct site visits for interested contractors at 1:00 PM on Thursday, February 2, 2012 and on Tuesday, February 7, 2012. Attendees must 1) make arrangements&nbsp;by calling Doug MacQueen at 315-764-3254 Tuesday through Friday between the hours of 6:30 AM and 5:00 PM, 2) come equipped with safety-toed shoes, hardhats and safety glasses and 3) sign a liability release form prior to the site visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is open from late March until late December each year and typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room in the lock for transiting vessels.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The preliminary designs for the project include installation of seven (7) steel pipes fifty (50) feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of twelve (12) square feet to be embedded in the concrete gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the miter gate sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gates having openings approximately six (6) feet wide and two (2) feet high with one (1) knife gate being hydraulically operated and the other manually operated. It is anticipated that the work will require removal of approximately 1,500 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery. The work will also include connecting the knife gate operators to existing hydraulic power units, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work will occur over a two (2) year period beginning in January 2013 due to the short winter shutdown periods (i.e. approximately ten (10) weeks) when the lock can be dewatered. Work that will not interfere with navigation can be accomplished during the navigation season. <br /><br />Drawings are attached to this notice.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:ivan.v.damaso@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New York</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District (the Corps), proposes to perform maintenance dredging of the federal navigation channel and deposition basins in East Rockaway Inlet. The channel was last dredged in 2010 with the removal of approximately 137,000 cubic yards (CY) of sand, which was used in a beneficial manner as beach nourishment, placed along severely eroded areas of the Rockaway Beach shoreline. The proposed maintenance dredging is expected to involve the removal of approximately 281,000 CY of sand, which would be used in a beneficial manner as beach nourishment placed along the Rockaway Beach shoreline. In recent cycles, the sand was placed between Beach 27th and Beach 38th streets or Beach 92nd and Beach 103rd streets. The channel and deposition basins will be dredged to a depth of 14 feet plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. The proposed work will be accomplished in Fiscal Year 2013, subject to the availability of funds. <br>The purpose of the proposed work is to alleviate the affects of shoaling and maintain the authorized project dimensions, thereby providing safe and economical use of the East Rockaway Inlet by commercial and recreational boating interests while providing beneficial use of the dredged material. Between maintenance operations, the bypassed sand placed at the feeder beach would be carried by littoral drift to feed down drift beaches. The maintenance operation would thus serve to place sand trapped in the channel back into the normal littoral movement that naturally replenishes the western beaches, while maintaining a safe channel for navigation. <br>Maintenance dredging of the channel and deposition basins at East Rockaway Inlet will be accomplished by pipeline dredge, hopper dredge, or similar plant. The entire channel will generally not require maintenance dredging; only areas where shoaling has reduced the depth of the channel will require dredging.<br>This solicitation is an Invitation for Bids.  The NAICs code is 237990.  The Plans and Specifications for the project are anticipated to be available on or about 24 July 2012 with a bid opening on or about 24 August 2012.

For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program, provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  ASI currently provides Software Engineering Support Services to LSRP under contract VA118-11-P-0089 (Period of Performance of 9/28/11 to 9/27/12).  ASI possesses the requisite capabilities, knowledge and expertise to provide the support services required.  ASI staff that will perform the Software Engineering Services consist of highly experienced project managers, SQA testers and Subject Matter Experts with strong skills and knowledge.  ASI has an SQA and software engineering process, templates, checklists, work product examples, and industry best practice standards that may be leveraged for this proposed effort. This coupled with ASI's knowledge of LSRP from VA118-11-P-0089 will enable ASI to provide a more efficient process by minimizing project start-up and on boarding time, and establishing a sound foundation for Software Engineering Services. Based on the above information, the Government has determined that ASI is capable of meeting all of VA's requirements. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541519 with a corresponding small business size standard of $25.5 million average annual revenue.  The estimated date of award for this action is July 31, 2012.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency Government. 

This notification shall close on July 18, 2012.  Questions/responses shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Den-el Opuszynski, den-el.opuszynski@va.gov.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Den-el Opuszynski, Contract Specialist, den-el.opuszynski@va.gov and Kevin Loesch, Contracting Officer, Kevin.Loesch@va.gov.

<DESC>OBJECTIVE: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITAION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR QUOTES AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
<p><br />In preparation for a future procurement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is performing market research to determine potential sources. Based on market research results, NOAA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses or award as a sole source procurement. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. The proposed project will eventually result in a firm-fixed-price contract.</p>
<p><br />TITLE: Advancing Bottomfish Assessment in the Pacific Islands Regions</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND: Since 2009/2010 the Pacific Islands Fisheries Group (PIFG) has been conducting research for the NMFS. They have conducted a fishery independent pilot survey, tag-recapture studies, fishery-dependent sampling, and constituent outreach. Data from the survey is used to determine optimal gear(s), sample sizes, and number of vessels needed to implement fishery independent surveys in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Guam, CNMI and American Samoa. Data from the tagging study provides growth and movement data to advance the development of species specific stock assessment models, as well as NMFS's understanding of connectivity. Expanding fishery dependent sampling throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) allows for the development of spatially explicit stock assessment models and biological reference points. Constituent meetings are an effective way of communicating progress, while at the same time promoting open communication and trust with local fisherman and scientists. This research is part of a larger initiative to advance bottomfish stock assessments in the Pacific Islands Region,</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE: The Government is trying to determine whether there are other sources for this survey support. Additional data are currently needed before transiting from a pilot survey to a full survey and for advancing current stock assessment methodologies. This market research allows NMFS to assess the adequacy of other sources to successfully conduct the required research. The Government is looking for a vendor that can perform all of the functions described in this announcement. The vendor shall be able to : (1) provide 3 fisherman for up to 45 days to conduct a pilot fishery independent survey for bottomfish in waters around Oahu and Maui using local fishing vessel; (2) expand the state of Hawaii's bottomfish tagging program to include other areas and species; (3) network with local fisherman and industry to expand fishery dependent sampling of bottomfish at major landing ports and/or auctions throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI); and (4) assist with logistics to discuss progress of the projects with local constituents, including the fishing and scientific communities.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the necessary vessels, personnel, equipment, and services (including all bottomfish fishing gear, bait and insurance for the vessel and the ship's personnel) to perform the research activities listed below.</p>

The intent of this procurement is to provide continued test/technical support, software maintenance/upgrades, and enhancements to baseline JENM software.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued.  GENERAL BACKGROUND The Department of Defense established the JTRS program to provide a family of software programmable radios designed around a Software Communications Architecture (SCA).  As such, the JTRS will provide reliable multi-channel voice, data, imagery, and video communications and eliminate communications problems caused by stovepipe legacy systems.  The JTRS will achieve these objectives through the procurement and fielding of a digital, programmable, modular communication system based on software-defined radio technology.  The JTRS program consists of a series of joint acquisition activities, managed by JPEO JTRS.  The objective of JTRS is to develop, produce, integrate, and field a family of interoperable, digital, modular, software defined radios that operate as nodes in a network to ensure wireless communications and networking for mobile and fixed forces.  Specifically, JTRS will have the ability to receive, transmit, and relay voice, data, and video.  JTRS is being developed in a Joint environment, thus allowing maximum hardware and software commonality and reduced porting efforts across Service platforms.  Through implementation of common waveforms, radios, software, and select ancillary component and network management equipment, JTRS will enable enhanced interoperability, reusability, supportability, and software portability, and will result in improved speed to capability, and more effective implementation of incremental capability improvements.  JENM BACKGROUND JENM consists of highly specialized software applications which are integral to the operation of JTRS networking waveforms (Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)). The JENM software will provide a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) standard or common human-machine interface network management (NM) capability for the Services. Network management functions include planning, configuration management, fault management, performance management, security management, and account management. The JENM interfaces with other network managers, mission planning systems, network planning systems, and spectrum planning systems.  As part of this initiative, the JTRS NED program is evaluating the means by which they can establish and provide Software In-Service Support for the JENM software within this family of communications products.  REQUESTED INFORMATION Interested firms are invited to respond to this sources sought by providing a white paper that summarizes their relevant experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the required information below. Capability responses must include all of the following information:  (a)	Administrative Information:  1)	Company name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, e-mail, and title of designated point of contact; 2)	Business type (Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUB Zone, Veteran Owned and/or Service Disabled Veteran- Owned Business); 3)	Business size including total annual revenue, by year, for the past three years and number of employees based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services; 4)	CAGE code and DUNS number (if available); 5)	A statement that your firm has the capacity to conform to FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. 6)	Facility security clearance of the responder  (b)	Desired Capabilities:  1)	Describe your process to investigate, validate, and fix problem reports with JENM software, and how you would modify it to work within the JTRS NED SwISS process. 2)	Describe your companys experience and/or capabilities with development, technical support, enhancement and maintenance of JENM software. 3)	Describe your companys experience and/or capabilities in SOA software development. 4)	Describe your companys experience in conduct of Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) of JTRS products. 5)	Describe your companys experience in support of NSA Information Assurance (IA) assessment of JTRS JENM software including Unified INFOSEC Criteria (UIC) allocation and Network Manager Software Security Report (NMSSR) development. 6)	Describe your companys capabilities to identify, provide and maintain a suitable test environment to validate changes made to the JENM software.

The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's application running on a cloud infrastructure. (A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud computing.  The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer.  The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and network components.  The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics.  Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer).  The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface.  The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.<br><br>The purpose of the contract is to provide the Army Medical Command with medical billing collections, reporting and utilization services for their multiple locations.  <br><br>Scope or mission of the contract:  The contractor shall provide SaaS solution entirely hosted and provided by the contractor..

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langleys chemists have synthesized a class of novel diamines for epoxy resins that possess both aromatic and aliphatic characteristics. These molecules have been shown useful in two unrelated areas. First, the diamines have been demonstrated to aid in the dispersion of carbon nanotubes into polymer matrices. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) have countless applications, but their utilization has been somewhat impeded due to their inability to interface with polymers and due to the bundling of the tubes. The diamine molecules enable SWNT to be dispersed in a polymer and inhibit nanotubes bundling. Secondly, composite materials containing the diamines possess the ability to provide both structural and radiation-shielding functions. Because the diamines are both aliphatic and aromatic, they are endowed with the dual properties of high hydrogen content and high strength, which are particularly well suited to neutron radiation-shielding applications. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic Relationships Office (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information. RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO for the purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO will follow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a wireless, open-circuit SansEC [Sans Electrical Connections] sensor that can be used for pharmaceutical applications without the need for physical contact. Many attributes of a container can be monitored, such as liquid or powder levels, temperature of contents, and changes caused by spoilage. Tampering can also be detected. The unique design of this thin-film sensor allows many of these properties to be measured with the sensor external to the container/package. Fill levels can be measured without the need to open the container. At the core of the technology is the NASA award-winning SansEC sensor, which is damage resilient and environmentally friendly to manufacture and use. The sensors use a magnetic field response measurement acquisition device to provide power to the sensors and to acquire physical property measurements from them. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic Relationships Office (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a miniaturized light detection and ranging (LIDAR) velocimetry sensor to analyze high velocity and boundary layer flows in real-world conditions. Using Rayleigh scattering, as opposed to the more common particle scattering, the patent pending NASA sensors provide multiple flow parameters without the need for particle-seeded flows. The compact fiber optic sensor design can be embedded directly in a test surface and allows for a variety of near-surface measurement formats enabling real-time three-component flow velocity mapping, composition, gas density, and temperature data. The versatility of the NASA Micro-LIDAR sensor platform offers broad utility in advanced aerodynamic and fluid dynamic applications requiring boundary layer, unseeded flow measurements.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR COMMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED USE OF A DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (DEC) for the Preclinical Drug Development Services for the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)  

SUMMARY: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is seeking public comment on a proposed use of a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act, for its Preclinical Drug Development Services Program.

BACKGROUND: To carry out the NIH mission of promoting Science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability, the NCATS organizationally located within NIH conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development. 

The NCATS Division of Pre-clinical Innovation (DPI) aims to help bridge the gap in investment in early development phases for new drugs to help patient populations with unmet medical needs. Currently, NCATS DPI has two programs, the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) program, to assist academic scientists, non-profit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies working on developing novel therapies for unmet medical needs.  NCATS may create additional programs needing pre-clinical drug developments services in the future. 

Through the BrIDGs program (formerly the NIH RAID Program), NIH makes available, on a competitive basis, certain critical resources needed for the development of new therapeutic agents. It is intended to advance promising therapies into the clinic by providing in-kind services to overcome late stage preclinical therapy development obstacles. 

The TRND programs goal is to encourage and speed the development of new drugs for rare and neglected tropical diseases. This program is specifically intended to stimulate drug discovery and development research collaborations between NIH and academic scientists, non-profit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies working on rare and neglected illnesses.  The TRND program provides an opportunity to partner with and gain access to rare and neglected tropical disease drug development capabilities, expertise, and clinical/regulatory resources in a collaborative environment with the goal of moving promising therapeutics into human clinical trials. TRND uses an application and evaluation process to select collaborators. Selected TRND collaborators/contributors will provide their proprietary drugs, drug manufacturing process and development platforms and disease expertise throughout the project.  NCATS through its internal resource, contracts and subcontracts will provide screening, lead optimization, preclinical development and product development of a contributors proprietary Materials, as needed.

NCATS experience has shown that many owners of candidate Material and/or Technology, particularly in the commercial sector, will refuse to submit their Material and/or Technology for screening, lead optimization, preclinical development and product development where there is a risk that Government contractors will obtain rights to Subject Inventions relating to the Material and/or Technology.  Material and/or Technology owners have argued forcefully that the risk of losing rights in patents that would effectively block the commercialization of their own proprietary Material and/or Technology, in which they have invested considerable resources to develop and upon which their very viability as a business is dependent, is not acceptable.

The projects undertaken by the TRND and BrIDGs Programs will most likely generate new inventions. The Bayh-Dole Act establishes the rights and obligations of grantees and contractors to Subject Inventions-inventions that are conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement by the Federal Government. One of the goals of the Bayh-Dole Act is to incentivize the commercialization of Government-supported Subject Inventions. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, Government contractors generally retain the right to elect title to inventions made by its researchers as a result of their work performed under a Government-supported agreement.  A Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Bayh-Dole Act directs ownership of inventions made by the funding recipient to the Government or other party. Thus, without a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances, the NCATS contracted medicinal chemists, screening facilities, contract research organizations and other services would retain the right to elect title/ownership of inventions to all new proprietary therapeutics intellectual property that they develop under an agreement with NCATS.

In order to ensure those pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, small businesses, academic institutions, and others will collaborate with NCATS in order to help in identifying, testing, developing, and commercializing new therapeutics, diagnostics, prognostics and prophylactic measures against human diseases, NCATS has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as described above, and that the Contractors and subcontractors rights (at all tiers) in subject inventions should be limited accordingly.  Because the TRND and BrIDGs Programs will be helping move a Providers proprietary intellectual property, including Materials and Methods through the drug development pipeline, this DEC will better ensure Providers ability to promote the commercialization and therefore public availability of these inventions without unduly encumbering future research and discovery by the contractor.

Discussions with potential TRND and BrIDGs Contributors and Contractors suggest that allowing the Contractors to retain ownership to any newly developed proprietary therapeutics intellectual property would actually impede the further development and commercialization of new drugs. In order to develop good lead therapeutics, the TRND and BrIDGs Program must attract promising, high quality drug development projects including starting therapeutics. Potential Contributors have consistently informed NCATS that they would participate in TRND and BrIDGs only if they could be assured full ownership of patent rights to all analogs generated from their starting therapeutics as well as any novel processes to scale up the therapeutics. 

PROPOSED IP STRATEGY: For the Preclinical Drug Development Services Program, the NCATS is considering a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act. The DEC would cover two classes of Subject Inventions:

Class 1:  Subject Inventions that require the use of, improve, or incorporate any Material and Subject Inventions that are methods of manufacturing or synthesis of a Material.  If the Contributor declines offer of assignment, then NCATS may dispose of the invention rights as NCATS determines would be in the best interests of the program and public health (e.g., allow Contractor to retain invention rights).

Class 2:  Subject Inventions that do not fall into Class 1 above.   
Rights to all other Subject Inventions will be retained by the Contractor pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act.

RESPONSES: The NCATS invites comments on this strategy and use of a DEC for the Preclinical Drug Development Services Program. Alternative strategies that will support the development and encourage the contribution of novel therapeutics to the program will be considered before a final determination is made regarding the use of a DEC.
Please submit your comments to the attention of Kelli Broda, Contract Specialist, at the address below by 4:00 PM Local Time on May 17, 2012.

<SUBJECT>B--Intent to Award: USGS Vegetation Panel for testing and analysis
<SOLNBR>G12PS00518
<CONTACT>Katherine Vultaggio

<a href="mailto:kvultaggio@usgs.gov">kvultaggio@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for a firm-fixed price purchase order for peer review process testing for 1 base year and 1 option year, in support of the development of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Standard.  Period of performance will be a base year plus one option year.
The USGS is procuring the services of a vegetation panel to conduct a test of the proposed formal peer review process for adopting new types (e.g. associations, alliances, groups) into the National Vegetation Classification (NVC).  The process includes: collecting, analyzing and synthesizing vegetation data and conducting rigorous peer reviews.
This purchase order will include support for testing the Peer Review process through a set of pilot projects in which regional vegetation data are analyzed, an NVC proposal for new types of vegetation is developed, and a peer review board decides on which new types are to be inducted into the USNVC.   The Ecological Society of America Vegetation Panel manages the peer review board responsible for conducting these reviews and would be responsible for managing the project.  
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to the Ecological Society of America (ESA), unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they have obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Katherine Vultaggio via email at: kvultaggio@usgs.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST, Monday, July 23, 2012 with an affirmative answer.   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor=BFs unique qualifications:
No other organization maintains and has access to the legacy vegetation plot data, the scientific expertise, and the institutional knowledge necessary to complete this task.
The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Vegetation Subcommittee is the group responsible for overseeing the development of the standard.  The standard was published as a =BFDynamic content=BF standard =BF meaning that it will continue to evolve as new data are gathered and assessments done.  ESA is one member organization to the FGDC.
The implementation plan developed by the FGDC Veg Subcommittee outlines roles and responsibilities of the member organizations.  In that plan, the ESA Veg Panel is identified as having responsibility for managing the peer review process through the NVC Peer Review Board. A full and open competition is not feasible because the detailed vegetation plot level data necessary to conduct the regional analyses are not available publically.  ESA has rights to access this data. The data will not be released to the public.

In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing.</p>
<p>(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.

<p>(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

<p>(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS.</p>

<p>(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.</p>

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services..<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award.

Occupational Therapy Scope of Work 
Purpose: Within the education system, the role of the occupational therapist ranges from direct service provider to provider of services such as consulting, program development, and training. By providing these services, occupational therapists are able to indirectly serve students while the students learn in settings that are more inclusive and thus comply with the least restrictive environment mandate. Additionally, the IDEA requirement that services is delivered within the general education curriculum as much as possible is mel. Therefore, occupational therapists in schools often take on a greater role as consultants than when they work in non-educational settings. Occupational therapy services delivered to students, or on behalf of students, must be considered within the therapist's realm of work. Service delivery involves the therapist and the IEP team in a collaborative process of designing and implementing services in the most appropriate and least restrictive environment. 
A specific student performance area that is to be address by Occupational therapist when it Is required for a student to participate in school activities and remain in the least restrictive environment include: 
1. Performance Skills-small units of performance a. Motor skills that include skills in moving and interacting with tasks, objects, and the environment (posture, mobility related to moving the body in space when interacting with tasks or objects, coordination, strength, and effort and energy). b. Process skills that include temporal organization to begin and end a task in logical sequence, organization of space and objects to find and use materials, and adaptation, which allows the student to notice cues in the environment and make adjustments as needed (finding a quiet area to read or write in the classroom when it gets noisy). c. Interaction/communication skills that include physicality (using the physical body when communicating, making physical contact with others, using eye gaze to communicate) and relations (maintaining appropriate relationships by collaborating, conforming to social norms, and learning to establish rapport with others). 2. Performance Patterns-behaviors developed over time a. Habits-specific, automatic behaviors that can either support or interfere with a student's performance in the school environment. b. Routines-established sequences of activities that provide a structure for daily life at school. c. Roles-set of behaviors that have some socially agreed upon function and for which there is an accepted code of norms. 3. Context-a variety of interrelated conditions within and surrounding the student that can influence performance within the school setting: a. Cultural-customs, beliefs, activity patterns, behavior standard, and expectations accepted by the society of which the student is a member. b. Physical-accessibility to and performance within buildings and environment, objects, tools, devices, sensory qualities of environment. c. Spiritual-that which inspires and motivates the student. 4. Activity Demands-aspects of an activity needed for the student to carry out the activity a. Objects and their properties (pencils, scissors, crayons, utensils). b. Space demands (size, room arrangement, surface, lighting, temperature, noise). c. Social demands (rules of games. expectations of peers). d. Sequence and timing for activities (example steps to making a sandwich for lunch). e. Required actions (usual skills required by student to carry out activity). f. Required body functions and body structures (use of two hands, crossing midline, joint mobility). 5. The occupational therapist, as a member of the IEP team, participates in the development of and Decision-making process relating to IEP goals (and, if appropriate, short-term objectives), frequency and duration of services, as well as monitoring of the IEP and progress toward IEP goals. 6. The occupational therapist provides evaluation and therapy services based upon educational referrals, not physician referrals. Should the school receive a referral from a physician, the IEP team must consider the referral and base any subsequent recommendations on educational need. If a student has an identifiable occupational therapy need that does not affect the student's ability to learn and benefit from the educational experience, that therapy is not the responsibility of the school.

These services can be delivered through individual, small group, and/or whole class activities. Individual contacts may require an isolated setting for a short period; the focus of any pullout service is to return the student to the naturally occurring setting as soon as possible.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children. Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

Price proposals shall include cost buildup details to identify: 1.	Direct cost elements, (e.g. labor, materials, travel, subcontracts, etc); 2.

DESCRIPTION: Occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistants are part of the education team within a school district.  The profession of occupational therapy is concerned with a person's ability to participate in desired daily life activities or "occupations".  In the schools, occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children to be prepared for and perform important learning and school related activities and to fulfill their role as students.  In this setting, occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants support academic outcomes including social skills, math, reading, writing, recess, participation in sports, self-help skills, prevocational/vocational participation and more, for children and students with disabilities, 3 to 21 years of age.

These areas can be addressed through a variety of intervention strategies, which may include direct therapy with the child, consultation with the teacher, modification of the environmental, provision of adaptive equipment, and staff training.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The NCI Animal Production Program (APP), administered by BTB, within DTP is responsible for supplying genetically defined inbred rodents to the many NIH/NCI research efforts. This includes NIH campus, research contractors, collaborators and grantees. These rodents must be monitored to insure they are genetically identical. This allows investigators to duplicate research and use rodents identical to the ones used previously. It allows for consistent research results. The baseline genetic profiles have been developed for each inbred NCI strain and will be compared to all future test results to insure there is no genetic drift in the foundation colonies.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial itemss prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.  Solicitation provisions incorporate provisions through FAC 2005-59.  The NAICS code is 541620 and this is not a set aside.  The following provisions apply to this solicitation and/or resultant contract: 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-04 and 52.212-05.  The closing date for this solicitation is 2:00pm (Denver time) on July 24, 2012.   Proposals shall be submitted electronically to bob_dobson@nps.gov.  Offerors are advised there are file limitations regarding receipt of proposals so follow up on receipt by the offeror is advised.
The solicitation requires submission of a firm fixed price for the entire geologic project as detailed below: Title: Geomorphic Mapping in Four National Park Service Units in Northeast Florida  Solicitation P12PS22044 Overview
The National Park Service (NPS) has undertaken a Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) of 270 natural area park units.  Four park units in northeast Florida;  Fort Matanzas National Monument (FOMA), Castillo de San Marcos National Monument (CASA), and Fort Caroline National Monument (FOCA) and Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve (TIMU)), are included in these 270 areas.  The Geologic Resources Division administers the program and is charged with providing each park with: 
1) An evaluation of park geologic resources and issues, 2) An assessment of geologic map coverage and production of digital products, and 3) A compilation of a geologic report with basic geologic information, hazards and issues, and existing data and research relating to the park.
Geologic mapping requires particular expertise and familiarity with the various features and processes inherent in these areas.  This project will provide resource management at FOMA, CASA, FOCA, and TIMU with the necessary geologic information to help make scientifically sound resource management decisions.  Shorelines add an extra dimension to park mapping needs with adjacent offshore terrain.  No comprehensive geologic maps exist that meet park management needs for barrier islands parks on the Atlantic Coast. GRI mapping protocols for coastal parks will be applied to these four parks.  The resulting data themes will be assembled and revised to ensure resource managers can routinely access and utilize the data as an effective means of informed decision making.
This project will characterize the complex geomorphology and ecologically unique resources of FOMA, CASA, FOCA, and TIMU using Coastal Geology Mapping Protocols developed by the NPS Geologic Resources Inventory Program for Atlantic and Gulf National Park Units (NPS-D-2269).  In pursuit of this goal, a centralized information network consisting of spatially explicit thematic maps and supporting data will be constructed for all emergent areas within the four parks' Quadrangles of Interest (QOI) in adherence with the NPS Geology-Geographic Information System (GIS) Data Model.  Frequent communication between project and NPS personnel will ensure the deliverables meet local and national needs.
Scope of Work
General Contractor requirements The contractor must be capable of producing a digital geologic map, defined as a map that depicts the geographic distribution at the Earth's surface of bedrock and/or surficial geologic materials and structures, on a published base map showing topography, hydrography, culture, cadastral, and other base information.  Digital geologic maps may also contain a great variety of point data for specific sites, creating a 3-dimensional database, where applicable.  A geologic map generally includes an explanation, description of map units and symbols, cross sections, and a variety of other information.  Geologic maps produced under this contract must meet those standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2009 STATEMAP program announcement No. 09hQPA0003.  This document can be found online at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/STATEMAP/index.html.
The contractor must furthermore be capable of producing the above map including those coastal units and features described in the above mentioned NPS publication NPS-D-2269, Coastal Geology Mapping Protocols for the Atlantic And Gulf National Park Units, pages 20 through 24.  This document can be found online at: http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/coastal/newsletters/finalreportWEB.pdf
The QOIs are USGS 7  minute quadrangles identified by each park during a series of geologic scoping meetings held there in 2009.  Summaries of these meetings can be found on the GRI Publications Page at: http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/inventory/gre_publications.cfm
The geomorphic maps and GIS from other NPS barrier island parks can also be found at this site, such as Assateague Island National Seashore, Cumberland Island National Seashore, and Padre Island National Seashore.
The QOIs for each park are listed in the table below.
Park Quadrangles of Interest Fort Matanzas National Monument, Matanzas Inlet and Dinner Island NE Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, St Augustine and Saint Augustine Beach Fort Caroline National Monument and Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve	Amelia City, Hedges, Italia, Jacksonville Beach, Mayport, East Port, and Arlington The Contractor shall prepare the Final map products that include: "	Digital geologic map, preferably in ESRI ArcGIS 9.x or latest version; personal geodatabase (.mdb) for each digital geologic-GIS map with a Geologic Unit Information table and Source Map Information table, where applicable.  At a minimum, all geologic features present on the published map(s) are present as GIS data, and are fully attributed shape files to standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003 "	Spatial distribution of the those mappable units described in NPS-D-2269 (pages 20-24), where present "	Accompanying text and graphics containing map explanatory information, "	A description of map units; "	A stratigraphic column depicting stratified units; standard stratigraphic nomenclature must be consistent among all produced maps.  "	Where applicable, a correlation diagram showing age relationships of map units; "	An explanation of map symbols; and "	FGDC compliant metadata for all files developed. "	An accuracy assessment (peer review) must be conducted to validate the final maps. "	To ensure park staff can access and interpret the products produced in association with this project, a workshop will be held at each park.  At this workshop, hands on training and technical support will be provided by the principle investigators.  In addition, the comments of park staff must be specifically solicited prior to completing the project deliverables
These may be delivered via CD-ROM or by file transfer protocol (ftp), or some other suitable agreed upon electronic medium.
Government Provided Aerial Imagery  (To be provided by September 30, 2012)
High resolution aerial imagery controlled with airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) has recently been acquired by the NPS for these four park units and will be available to the contractor for use in the production of the new maps.  Available imagery includes diapositives and prints with a scale of 1:12,000,  high resolution color infrared diapositives and prints, and digital orthorectified images. All images contain a 60% end lap and a 30% side lap. 
Additionally, the NPS will provide (at any time requested by the contractor):
For CASA and FOMA 2004 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (Infrared) 2004 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (Natural Color)
TIMU and FOCA 1999 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (Infrared) 2004 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (Infrared) 2004 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (Natural Color) National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery from 2005

For QOI areas not covered by NPS provided imagery, best available data in the public domain, either through the USGS or NCRS, may be utilized.  These data sets are available at:
USGS: http://seamless.usgs.gov/data_availability.php?serviceid=Dataset_19 
NRCS: http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/ http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/ngmc/elevation  
Other data sets in the public domain may also be considered.   The final determination of which data set to use will be mutually agreed upon by the NPS and the contractor.

Bathymetry No new bathymetric data needs to be acquired for this project.  Existing public domain bathymetric data needs to be seamlessly integrated to the shorelines at FOMA and TIMU to a distance offshore of at least one quarter (1/4) mile.

It is the offeror's responsibility to thoroughly read this announcement and any attachments to familiarize themselves with changes to requirement as a result of this amendment.
THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
SOLICITATION NUMBER P12PS22727B
This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, FAC 2005-58, effective May 18, 2012.  
SET-ASIDES:  TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE (IAW FAR Subpart 19.5).  NAICS CODE: 221320, Small Business Size Standard:  $7.0M (Annual Average Receipts).
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS (SPECIFICATIONS):   1.  Provide a package above ground sewage treatment plant designed for the secondary treatment of domestic wastewater from 12 seasonal residents living in "dry cabins" served by a bathroom, shower house, kitchen and laundry building. The unit will be used at a location along the Nabesna Road in Wrangell St. Elias National Park.    2.  The estimated design flow rate from these users is 600 gpd.  The plant will be receiving macerated sewage from a grinder pump in a lift station located as shown on the drawings.  The sewage will be delivered at approximately 60 gallons per minute by the lift station, via a 2-inch HDPE line. 
3.  The plant shall have the following characteristics:
a.  The plant shall be designed to treat the wastewater described to meet secondary treated effluent discharge parameters, as identified by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  This effluent shall be discharged on the ground surface.  The supplier shall provide the Government with all data necessary to demonstrate compliance with ADEC standards.  This data will be submitted by a National Park Service engineer to ADEC for Construction Approval.  The Contractor shall not begin manufacture of the sewage treatment unit until approval has been received from the NPS.  
b.  The plant shall be designed to be weatherproof and resistant to UV degradation, as it will not be installed in a building.
c.  The plant shall be designed to be installed on the ground without requiring the construction of a foundation.  The site is underlain with permafrost so the plant shall be designed to not degrade the permafrost, by use of skids that limit the contact with the ground, insulation or both.  If insulation is utilized, it shall be provided by the supplier.
d.  The facility will be occupied from mid-May to mid-September, so the plant must be designed to be operational at an outside location (not in a building) during this period of time.
e.  The plant shall be designed for easy winterization to ensure that no damage will occur to the unit due to being shut down at temperatures as cold as -50oF.  Clear, easy to understand winterization instructions shall be provided with the owner's manual.
f.  The unit shall be provided prewired and pre-plumbed with all necessary components so that the owner only needs to provide power to the unit and plumb the inlet and discharge lines to the unit.  A National Park Service crew will install the sewage treatment plan once the contractor has delivered the unit to the site and placed it in the position shown on attached drawings.    A 2-inch line from a lift station and a 2-inch discharge line (not part of this supply contract) will be plumbed into the inlet and outlet lines of the plant by a National Park Service crew.
g.  The overall footprint of the plant shall not exceed 8 feet by 25 feet.
h.  The unit shall feature ultraviolet disinfection of the discharge effluent.  Chemical disinfection shall not be allowed.
i.  The unit shall come with a 2-year warranty.
4.  The manufacturer shall provide free initial onsite training for the unit and shall offer free telephone support for two years after purchase.
5.  Provide a cost to include delivery of the unit to the site, located at approximately Mile 10 of the Nabesna Road.  Point of contact for delivery will be provided at award of purchase order.   Offer shall specify the total price.  Adequate competition is anticipated for this acquisition.  The government anticipates award of a firm-fixed price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  DELIVERY DATE:  30 days after receipt of purchase order.

<p>DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Cataloging &amp; Serials Services for DOC Library</p>
<p><br />1. General Information and Scope of Work</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce promotes job creation, economic growth, sustainable development, and improved standards of living for all Americans by working in partnership with businesses, universities, communities, and our nation's workers. The Department touches the daily lives of the American people in many ways, with a wide range of responsibilities in the areas of trade, economic development, technology, entrepreneurship and business development, environmental stewardship, and statistical research and analysis.</p>
<p>The DOC Library provides resources and research support to Commerce employees so they are better able to fulfill the mission of the Department. The collections include both print and electronic materials and cover subject areas related to business, economics, trade, legislation, law, and government publications.</p>
<p>The library requires certain high-level skill sets in order to successfully process the subject-specific materials in the collection. Based on the size of the collection, the library only requires part-time cataloging assistance.</p>
<p>The DOC Library needs a Contractor to perform original and copy cataloging of current and archival monographs, serials, and electronic resources for its collections. The Contractor will be responsible for adding, modifying, and discarding metadata in the online integrated library and the digital asset management system. Many items in the collection are damaged or deteriorating, and will require the Contractor to repair or recommend storage options based on current archival "best practices". The Contractor will perform basic technical work to prepare resources for shelving. <br />The Contractor shall perform these activities in various circumstances: when creating records for new materials; when upgrading lower-level records to full-level; when updating records to meet current bibliographic standards; when updating records for continuations of all kinds (i.e. serials, multipart items, government publications, newspapers) to include new bibliographic and/or holdings information; in handling referrals and requests for corrections from Library staff in the course of problem-solving; as a result of review/revision; on a project basis.</p>
<p>2. Description of Tasks and Deliverables</p>
<p>(i) Contractor shall perform original and copy cataloging of current monographs and serials (including title changes), and electronic resources for the DOC Library's collections.<br />(ii) Contractor shall provide original and copy cataloging of archival monographs, serials (including title changes), and electronic resources for the Department of Commerce and other government publications.<br />(iii) Contractor shall provide original cataloging for legislative histories in print and digitized formats.<br />(iv) Contractor shall recommend and enter metadata for legislative histories and other publications into the on-line integrated library system (ILS) and the digital asset management system.<br />(v) Contractor shall prepare and upload digitized resources into the digital asset management system.<br />(vi) Contractor shall create, modify, and maintain serial check-in records in the on-line integrated library system (ILS).<br />(vii) Contractor shall maintain the ILS records by checking weekly reports generated by the ILS and correcting typographical errors, cataloging errors, errors in ISBD punctuation, and any other errors noted.<br />(viii) Contractor shall modify current catalog records to reflect changes in print retention, electronic holdings, subject fields, location, call number, and deaccession.<br />(iv) Contractor shall identify damaged or fragile materials and repair or recommend storage options based on current archival "best practices".<br />(x) Contractor shall provide limited technical processing (including only labels, label covers, and barcodes).</p>
<p>3. Performance Standards: Of primary importance the Contractor's performance is catalog integrity, so performance of the various component activities must be as near to perfect as is possible (95%). Correcting errors, resolving problems caused by a wide variety of bibliographic and treatment conflicts and database cleanup to clarify the library's holdings are "end-of-the-line" activities, and there are generally no avenues for further referral, except for those matters which involve departures from standard library policies. These catalog management functions, therefore, are characterized by the relative lack of definable and measurable standards and outside indicators that can be used to gauge performance. As a result, the Contractor's performance shall be evaluated by a broad-based review process which takes into account the source of assignments, difficulty of problems, impact of problems and their resolutions, feedback from other library staff, and the overall condition of the catalog and collection as the result of regulation and repair activities. The COR shall inspect performance using spot checks of newly added or modified records, visual inspection of print materials processed for shelving in the archives or regular collection, and volume of assigned work completed when compared to the difficulty of the task.</p>
<p>4. Skill or Relevant Experience Requirements</p>
<p>Key personnel must have the following skills and experience:<br />&bull; A Masters Degree in Library Science or Library and Information Science from an institution accredited by the American Library Association.<br />&bull; Ten (10) years of recent professional library experience in original cataloging for monographs, serials, government publications, and electronic resources using the following:<br />o Anglo American Cataloging Rules (AARCII) and current updates;<br />o Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (most current);<br />o Library of Congress Classification Scheme;<br />o Library of Congress Subject Headings;<br />o MARC Bibliographic Format.<br />&bull; Ten (10) years of recent professional library experience using integrated library automation systems.<br />&bull; Ten (10) years of recent professional library experience providing cataloging and serials services in a special library, government, corporate, or non-profit setting in which the primary duties were processing and cataloging a variety of print and electronic materials in the subject areas of business, economics, trade, legislation, law, and government publications. <br />&bull; Five (5) years of professional library experience using OCLC.<br />&bull; Five (5) years of recent professional library experience using SirsiDynix Symphony, specifically using SmartPort, creating, modifying, and discarding records, and creating and maintaining serial control records.<br />&bull; Two (2) years of professional library experience using SirsiDynix Enterprise/Portfolio (digital asset management system).</p>
<p>5. Government-furnished Resources</p>
<p>A computer networked to a printer with the appropriate ILS and digital asset management system software, as well as Internet access, will be available. The Library will purchase all labels, label covers, barcodes, and any archival supplies the Contractor recommends that the COR deems reasonable to repair or store archival materials. The Library will provide copies of the Library of Congress Classification Schedules and the MARC Bibliographic Format.</p>
<p>6. Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance for the Base Period is from 9/1/2012 through 8/31/2013 with two (2) one-year options following the Base Period.</p>
<p>7. Required Working Hours</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-12-Q-200084 is issued as a Request For Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-59.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.
It is anticipated that a non-competitive contract shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation, 2701 Forum Drive, Grand Prairie, TX 75052, as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All equipment must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  Only the use of approved commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard equipment will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

 (a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the TAG.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of OFDA's TAG Team.  USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a DRR Advisor who will work with OFDA technical experts and regional representatives to integrate DRR activities into OFDA's response, recovery, and transition programs.  The Advisor will also review and provide technical feedback on quality of program design, as well as monitor implementation of DRR activities. The Advisor will ensure that DRR activities are in line with OFDA's strategic goals.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor will be based in Washington, D.C.  The duties and responsibilities are:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a focal point within USAID/OFDA for DRR programs and activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide advice on various DRR activities within the following areas: capacity building/training; community awareness/mobilization; public/private partnerships; policy, implementation and advocacy; integration of DRR within education and research programs; global advocacy and engagement;</p>

<p><br />EDUCATION/EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THIS POSITION<br />(Determines basic eligibility for the position.  Applicants who do not meet all of the education and experience factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)</p>
<p>Bachelor's degree with significant study in or pertinent to the field of disaster risk reduction -- this may include, but is not limited to, sustainable development, disaster management, natural resource management, economics, or social sciences.  Additionally, a minimum of seven (7) years of experience in progressively responsible work in humanitarian relief and response is required, of which at least four (4) years must be a majority of direct DRR experience.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Master's or PhD degree with significant study in or pertinent to the field of disaster risk reduction -- this may include, but is not limited to, sustainable development, disaster management, natural resource management, economics, or social sciences.  Additionally, a minimum of five (5) years of experience in progressively responsible work in humanitarian relief and response is required, of which at least two (2) years must be a majority of direct DRR experience.</p>
<p>SELECTION FACTORS<br />(Determines basic eligibility for the position.  Applicants who do not meet all of the selection factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)<br />&bull;	Applicant is a U.S. Citizen;<br />&bull;	Complete and hand-signed federal form OF-612 and OF-612 continuation sheets submitted;<br />&bull;	All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 to allow for adequate evaluation of your related and direct experience.  Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the experience requirements.<br />&bull;	Supplemental document specifically addressing the Quality Ranking Factors (QRFs) submitted;<br />&bull;	Ability to obtain a SECRET level security clearance as provided by USAID.<br />&bull;	Satisfactory verification of academic credentials.</p>
<p>QUALITY RANKING FACTORS (QRFs)<br />(Used to determine the competitive ranking of qualified applicants in comparison to other applicants.  The factors are listed in priority order from highest to least.)</p>
<p>QRF #1          Describe your experience in designing and/or implementing disaster risk reduction programs at the: 1) community level, and 2) national level.  What lessons have you learned from your experience at each level?</p>
<p>QRF #2           What factors would you look at to determine whether a community-based program will successfully and sustainably reduce risk?  What factors are likely to lead to failure?</p>
<p>QRF #3         The capacity, behavior and mandate of national institutions play an important role in DRR at the national level.  What insights or learned good practices would you offer in working with national-level institutions responsible for risk management and reduction?</p>
<p>QRF #4          Donors and implementing agencies wrestle with the question of how to distinguish between disaster risk reduction programs and development programs.  USAID/OFDA's mandate allows the use of the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account to fund DRR programs, but not development programs.  What process or criteria might you use to determine whether a proposed intervention fell within the OFDA mandate for DRR, or whether it should be considered a development program that falls outside of OFDA's mandate?</p>
<p>QRF #5         With increased emphasis on the resilience agenda, USAID/OFDA is coordinating with a wide range of USG and international partners to build resilience among populations, particularly those faced with recurrent disasters.  How would you describe the role of DRR within this larger agenda, and what lessons have you learned in coordinating with other organizations for integrating DRR into a variety of programming options?</p>
<p>QRF #6          The position requires the incumbent to work across a range of sectors (e.g. WASH, health, food security) and countries, whether or not s/he has direct experience in any of them.  Describe how your expertise in DRR programs will allow you to work with a range of sectoral and regional experts to develop strategies for DRR.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page nine of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. While the Sr. Transition Specialist may be supervised by any OTI team or division leader or his/her designee, the initial supervisor for the position under this solicitation will be OTI's Program Learning, and Innovation leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Transition Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Senior Transition Specialist requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Senior Transition Specialist is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Senior Transition Specialist is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Senior Transition Specialist has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Senior Transition Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with supervisor. The Washington-based Senior Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance, including providing supervisory support;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull;	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, recommend strategic courses of action, facilitate closeout meetings, and provide ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI supervisor, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Subfactor - Certification/Licenses<br />The offeror will provide documentation substantiating their status as a Motorola Premier Service Partner and that technicians have Motorola certification on equipment and functions that make up the system to be supported and is certified to provide services in accordance with the standard of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The offeror will have at least one technician with ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Quantar Repeater certification/training. Other technicians will have Motorola certifications/training in one of the following courses, or comparable legacy certifications:<br /><br />(1) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Introduction to Radio System Management Applications<br />(2) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Radio System Administrator Workshop<br />(3) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Secure Communications Workshop<br />(4) ASTRO&reg;25 IV&amp;D Telephone Interconnect<br />(5) Basic Trunking and ASTRO Concepts<br /><br />Newly hired technicians after award of contract or technicians without certification/training must acquire training within 12 month of contract award</p>
<p>2. Subfactor -- Staffing Plan<br />The Government will evaluate each plan to assure that it reflects a sound understanding of the contract staffing requirements. The offeror must fully describe how they intend to staff the shop to perform the work. The offeror must also demonstrate a capability to staff the shop in times of concurrent or simultaneous unscheduled maintenance events, multiple system outages and surge.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. Next, all technically acceptable offers (and "unacceptable" proposals that are correctable) shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule (See para C.1(a) of Addendum To 52.212-1, Proposal Preparation Instructions) by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. Copies of the Pricing Schedule will be necessary in order to submit a proposal for each Option Year.</p>
<p>C. The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government has in the offeror's ability to supply the Land Mobile Radio maintenance services that meet users' needs, based on the offeror's demonstrated record of performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table 5, Performance Confidence Assessments. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and the offeror is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>F. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>G. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>H. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br />(End of Clause Addendum)</p>

<p>Requirements Listing</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - 16" Stainless Steel Pneumatic Gate Valve<br />Quantity: 1 EACH<br />Manufacturer Name: High Vacuum Valves<br />Part Number: 11212-1603R or equivalent</p>
<p>Specifications on CLIN 0001:</p>
<p>The necessary requirements for the 16" gate valve are as follows:</p>
<p>a. 16" inner diameter (iso400) flange connections. 16" to maximize conductance to pumps while keeping the width along at least one axis of all components under 21" (so that a 4 coils magnetic field system can be installed). Hence, a 21" x 40" rectangular gate valve is acceptable, but a 27" x 38" pendulum gate valve is not. Aluminum or stainless is acceptable as long as it matches the other requirements. Stainless would be preferable.<br /><br />b. Maximum differential pressure between both sides of gate valve when closed of at least 1 atm (760 Torr) so that turbomolecular pumps can be kept running when the vacuum chamber is vented.<br /><br />c. High vacuum capability of at least 10-7 Torr.<br /><br />d. Rebuilt valves are acceptable to minimize cost but shall have the same specifications as a new valve. You must identify in the quote if your proposing a new or rebuilt valve.<br /><br />e. Low vibration valve operation to protect turbomolecular pumps.<br /><br />f. Pneumatic for automatic operation and for compatibility with turbomolecular pump fail safes.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the items/services offered to meet or exceed the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the government. If the PAG determines that competing technical proposals are essentially equal, the price factor becomes increasingly important and may become the determining factor in the source selection decision.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the offeror has the capability to perform the required services which demonstrates knowledge of the requirement to meet the Government's scope of work. If other than the OEM, provide experience within the last 3 years of providing this type of service for the same brand of instruments. Include documentation of technical competency on the operation and repair of the JEOL TEM and accessory components. Such documentation should include certification from the original equipment manufacturer within the past calendar year.</p>

Contractors shall include the firm's DUNS number with quote.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors are afforded the opportunity to inspect the system prior to the due date of the solicitation by contacting the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer identified herein to schedule an appointment. Failure to inspect the system will not relive the successful offeror from fully meeting the requirements of the resulting contract at the price offered. Price shall include any recertification fees.</p>

<p>The Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2012), applies to this acquisition.

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br />At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><strong>MSFSC INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING CHARGES<br /></strong>At the time of invoice, a shipping receipt must be provided to substantiate shipping or freight charges greater than $25.00.</p>
<p><strong>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</strong></p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br /></strong>Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><strong>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br /></strong>Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 5 - QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES<br /><br />1. QUESTION: Are all amendments included in latest amendment? RESPONSE: ALL INFORMATION HAS BEEN UPDATED. ANY AMENDMENTS WERE INCORPORATED IN EACH OF THE AMENDMENTS. IF YOU HAVE THE LAST SHOWING #5, THEN YOU WILL HAVE ALL INFORMATION UPDATED.<br />2. QUESTION: Task 2 calls for consultations with Native Hawaiians and other interested parties AND among these groups and NMFS staff. Is it the intent of the solicitation to have two sets of meetings one without NMFS staff present and one with NMFS staff present? RESPONSE: NMFS CAN BE PRESENT SO THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE MEETING PER ISLAND, OR THERE CAN BE SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH AND WITHOUT NMFS. NMFS WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE AVAILABLE AS NEEDED TO ATTEND ANY MEETING - WE WILL LEAVE IT TO THE CONTRACTOR TO PROPOSE THE BEST APPROACH.<br />3. QUESTION: Can we assume that the consultations conducted in Task 2 will be used for the development of the CIA (Task 3) and for the Section 106 process (Task 4)? RESPONSE: YES, THE TASK 2 CONSULTATIONS CAN BE USED FOR THE CIA AND SEC 106 PROCESS , PROVIDED THEY ARE CONDUCTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH NHPA AND NEPA GUIDELINES.<br />4. QUESTION: The deliverable time schedule show 15 days between submittal of both the Draft CIA and Section 106 report and the Final CIA and Section 106 report. Can we assume that NMFS will review the documents and respond within that time frame leaving us adequate time to make any requested revisions? RESPONSE: YES, NMFS WILL PROVIDE TIMELY REVIEW - COMMENTS WILL BE BACK TO THE CONTRACTOR BY OR BEFORE 3 BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE REPORTS.<br />5. QUESTION: Is the draft MOA or PA (Task 4) intended to be a part of the Section 106 report? If not, when is this deliverable due. RESPONSE: THE DRAFT MOA OR PA SHOULD BE PART OF THE FINAL REPORT.<br />6. QUESTION: Did the decision to revise these sections result from public comments to the draft PEIS, from concerns expressed by SHPD, OHA and NHOs, or a combination of all of these. It would be useful for the Contractor to know which stakeholders expressed concerns and what those concerns are so that they can be adequately addressed in preparing the implementation plan. RESPONSE: AMENDMENTS WERE MADE DUE TO INTERNAL GOVERNMENT REVIEW AND IMPROVEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.<br />7. QUESTION: One of the tasks outlined in the RFP is "identify historic properties, cultural resources, and religious and/or traditional practices that may be affected by the actions proposed in the PEIS and determine whether these properties are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. RESPONSE: THE LIST CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TYPES OF PROPERTIES. IF THERE ARE PRE-EXISTING LISTS AND/OR LISTS ARE DEVELOPED DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS, THOSE SHOULD BE INCLUDED, BUT NMFS UNDERSTANDS THERE WILL BE LIMITATIONS ON THE LIST DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT.

Walls that remain collapsed allow for vehicles to enter from any direction without damaging the containment system.  The height of the walls must be that which will allow enough internal volume to contain all 2000 gallons of fuel in the event of a spill.  Any side wall supports shall not contain metal.  Previously used systems used a metallic material in their support system and we found that this was the cause of several flat tires.  A puncture from any sort of metal would render the containment system un-usable and the possibility of a HAZWAST spill is greatly increased. 10.)Base of the containment system must be of a material that will sustain constant wear from off road tires and the weight of the fuel vehicle itself.  Must allow for vehicle traffic to enter and exit at any angle.
All quotes shall include price(s), a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, contractor?s CAGE code and payment terms. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the offeror to meet all specifications and requirements.

The Government's obligation under this Pre-Solicitation and follow on Request for Proposals (RFP) is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from end of fiscal year funding. No legal liability on the part of the Government for payment of any money shall arise unless, and until, funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this procurement and award has been made by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Work under this project will re-stripe portions of the KAFB Airfield including ramps B, C, D and E. Repairs include restriping taxi-lines, access road designation lines, stop bars, hold lines, parking designations, AGE equipment areas, toolbox tie-down boxes as well as any additional striping related items deemed necessary to provide a satisfactory project. Major work to be accomplished includes, but is not limited to furnishing all plant, labor, equipment and materials for materials testing, working drawing preparation, site preparation, striping and construction. Estimated Period of Performance (POP) for requirement is 72 days. IAW FAR 36.204(c) the estimated price range for this requirement is between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>

<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled.

The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 09 July 2012 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:
<p>1. Are here any specific instructions for the preparation of technical proposals that include any specific format or content for the proposal? <br />Answer: No<br />2. Should the cost proposal be provided separately from the technical proposal?<br />Answer: yes<br />3. Have any evaluation factors been established for determining the responsiveness of bidders to the subject solicitation and if so, what weighing factors will be used?<br />Twenty percent each will be given to the five subjects in the research synopsis.<br />4. On Page 10 of 13 of the solicitation, there are two "Basis of Award" paragraphs: one is lowest price, and one is a best value. Does this mean the government has the option to do one or the other?<br />Answer: Should be lowest priced technically acceptable. My mistake. <br />5. Can you please let me know if educational units such as universities can submit a response? Alone? Or in working with a glove manufacturer? <br />Answer: Universities are exempt from the total small business set aside.</p>

<DESC><p>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6. This Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes in order to identify companies who can provide water, wastewater and non-potable collection systems for the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). The USAFA seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution system (NAICS 221310) at the USAFA, Colorado. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. This Notice is not a solicitation or a Request for Proposal so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please do not submit a quote or proposal</span>.</p>
<p>It is this agency's intention to do an unrestricted acquisition unless there are responsive small businesses capable of meeting requirements. When applicable, interested companies must reference their 8(a), HUBZone, Women-Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran status. This must be signed by a company officer with authority to bind the company.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to assume ownership of the water distribution system at USAFA, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via this utility system, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility system.</p>
<p>Because this Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the future. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested at the bottom of the Notice to the USAFA.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Installation Description:</strong></p>
<p>The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows:</p>
<p>The <strong>potable water system</strong> consists of water mains, isolation valves, pressure reducer valves, air relief valves, backflow prevention devices, water services, fire hydrants and storage reservoirs. Water is supplied at the southwest corner of the property from water treatment plants owned and operated by Colorado Springs Utilities (CSU). The distribution system on the USAFA grounds has five reservoirs for storage of treated water and a network of approximately 61 miles of buried pipes that vary in size from three quarters of an inch to 24 inches in diameter. This system of pipes and appurtenances distribute treated water to all five areas within the USAFA property.</p>
<p>The <strong>wastewater collection system</strong> at the USAFA consists of building service lines, laterals, mains, manholes, cleanouts, individual sewage disposal systems (septic tanks and leach fields), and lift stations. Originally constructed in the 1950's the collection system has been upgraded periodically and expanded to handle increased system demands over the years. A network of 39.2 miles of piping, 675 active manholes and three lift stations comprises the collection system. Pipe materials include cast-iron, ductile iron, vitrified-clay, PVC and reinforced concrete. Portions of the vitrified clay and concrete pipe have been rehabilitated with cured-in-place pipe (CIPP). Manholes are brick / tile lined or pre-cast / cast-in place<br />concrete. Lift station 8023 was constructed in 1958 and lift stations 9005 and 9013 were constructed in 1973 to provide service to Jacks Valley.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)</strong> was a part of the construction in the 1950's. Design capacity was initially 2.2 mgd with a rate discharge capacity of 1.4 mgd. Wastewater is treated with primary, secondary, and advanced secondary treatment facilities. Treated water is then pumped to the non-potable system or discharged to Monument Creek under a NPDES permit. Solids removed are treated and land applied. There are individual sewage disposal systems for buildings with no access to the collection system.</p>
<p>The <strong>non-potable water system</strong> consists of water lines, isolation valves, pressure reducer valves, pumps, wells and storage reservoirs. Although they are a part of the system, the smaller distribution lines to the sprinkler heads are not discussed here. Non-potable water is stored in four (4) reservoirs spread across the USAFA. Non-potable water supply is obtained from seven (7) groundwater wells (Well Numbers 2B, 4A, 3A, 9A, 5A, 1A and 1B from north to south); reuse of the Waste Water Treatment Plant effluent; stream flow during rainstorm events; and, rain falling directly into the reservoirs. The main distribution system on the USAFA grounds has a network of approximately 28 miles of buried pipes that vary in size from 4 to 16<br />inches in diameter. Additionally, there are numerous smaller distribution lines associated with the actual sprinkler systems. This system of pipes and appurtenances delivers non-potable irrigation water to the golf courses, the academic area athletic fields, the roadway medians, the Service and Supply area and other miscellaneous smaller areas. The non-potable system currently contains asbestos cement (AC), cast iron (CI), ductile iron (DI), poly vinyl chloride (PVC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes.</p>
<p>Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are: all meters, irrigation systems, non-potable wells and/or water rights, and non-potable fire systems.</p>
<p>Annual Consumption, FY11, is 458.4 million gallons (MG) with a monthly average usage for FY11 of 38.2 MG.</p>
<p><br />Additional Information:</p>
<p>Design and construct new water distribution system(s) to provide potable water supply service to new buildings as identified by the USAFA.</p>
<p>Demolish the existing water distribution system and sections thereof no longer in service as identified by the USAFA.</p>
<p>Design and construct new waste water distribution system(s) to provide potable water supply service to new buildings as identified by the USAFA.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001: To delay the dates tentatively scheduled in the Pre-solicitation Notice.&nbsp; Please see attached Amendment 001.<br /><br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the responsibility of maintaining a definitive supply of medical countermeasures - or the forward deployment of same - for use in national medical emergencies declared by the Secretary of HHS.
<p>HHS has a requirement to acquire, hold, and distribute medical countermeasures that will mitigate injuries caused by exposure to chemical threat agents, biological threat agents, and physical radiologic and nuclear exposures. In the case of exposure to radiologic or nuclear ionizing energy, the integrity and homeostasis of neutrophil number and function (i.e., neutropenia) is an early pathology that must be clinically addressed due to increased risk of infection and sepsis. The most common clinical treatment to address neutropenia is the use of Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF) as either Granulocyte (G) or Granulocyte-Macrophage (GM), also known as G-CSF or GM-CSF.</p>
<p>HHS through the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) to support the acquisition of:</p>
<p>1) Product: a recombinant human Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF) as either Granulocyte (G) or Granulocyte-Macrophage (GM), also known as G-CSF or GM-CSF, for use in the treatment of neutropenia arising as a primary pathology from hematopoietic progenitor cell injury caused by a radiation or nuclear incident. The USG intends to purchase up to 2.79 million doses;</p>
<p>2) Services: a vendor-managed inventory (VMI, or as otherwise proposed by the offeror) with rotation of stock to control product expiry. The offeror shall provide and implement an inventory management plan that shall also include a plan for "at need" delivery of product should the USG have an immediate need for product in a declared emergency.</p>
<p>3) Advanced Development: It is the goal of the forthcoming RFP to obtain licensed products which have the indication of treatment of neutropenia (regardless of cause). No product currently holds a license for the indication of neutropenia arising from exposure to ionizing radiation alone. Thus, the USG intends to fund the advanced development of G- and GM-CSF products for this new indication. Prior to the submission of the proposal, the Offeror must have regulatory consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in the treatment of neutropenia arising from exposure to ionizing radiation. It is the goal of BARDA to acquire one or more Colony Stimulating Factors (G- or GM-CSF) for mitigation of neutropenia arising from exposure to ionizing radiation. The optional cost reimbursement advanced development CLIN will provide BARDA with a compendium of studies that will support the use of the product in a declared emergency (a CDC and FDA agreement) and aid in taking the product to license or approval.</p>
<p>The Awardee(s) selected for this contract will be providing either the designated product, the vendor-managed inventory (VMI), or both. The successful Offeror(s) will provide product and service, or assure coordination with the product contractor (sponsor) or provider of the VMI (as appropriate) in providing product holding with stock rotation. Offerors shall propose a product delivery or availability schedule that may be subject to negotiation. The schedule for delivery or manner of product availability will be incorporated into the final contract upon award. The government may also assist qualified offeror(s) in the Advanced Development of their product under an optional Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to provide funding toward a second licensed indication for treating neutropenia arising from exposure to ionizing radiation. Offerors may submit proposals for acquisition of product only or acquisition of product with advanced development.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be for base period of up to five years or 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on TBD, with proposals being due on TBD. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov ) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. All responses should be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address, and should be submitted to the Point of Contact(s) identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of TBD.</p>

<DESC>9 July 2012 Updates: <br><br> 	REVISE RESPONSE DATE FROM 9 JULY 2012 TO 16 JULY 2012<br><br>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - for deployable shelters to be utilized as alternate facilities for the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST).   The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industries' expertise in identifying potential solutions to mobilize the EST so Army, National Guard and Army Reserve units can maximize the usage of their existing ESTs for home station training.   The Army is also considering the option of purchase of transportability kits to be utilized to augment existing government facilities to support EST or obtaining either of these capabilities through a services contract.<br>SIC Code 34, NAICS Code 332311<br>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ISSUE: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Management Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM CATT), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (PM GCTT) is contemplating alternate methods of mobilizing  some of its EST marksmanship trainers where it is deemed cost effective and maximizes training efficiency. The deployable facilities will be used as alternate EST training facilities that may be utilized in corrosive and austere environments. Transportability kits would temporarily allow training to occur in existing facilities that are not customized for EST operations.<br>PEO STRI is soliciting industries' feedback on the best methodology for mobilizing some of its current EST systems in order to maximize usage of its ESTs for home station training.  The current EST facility requirements are: <br><br>1.	Inside dimensions must meet, at a minimum, approximately the following dimensions: <br>a.	5 - Lane 20'W X 40' L<br>b.	10- Lane 40'W X 40' L<br>2.

Roof (must be able to withstand 10 lbs. per sq. foot)<br>13.	Must be easily transportable<br>14.	Set-up and tear-down of the shelters shall not exceed 8 hours with a four (4) man crew<br>15.	Shelters shall be weather resistant (corrosive and rust resistant)<br>16.	Have set-up and tear down instructions<br><br>Transportability Kits would have the following characteristics:<br><br>1.	Ability to be deployed to an existing facility with power and environmental controls.<br>2.	Inside dimensions must meet, at a minimum, approximately the following dimensions: <br>a.	5 - Lane 20'W X 40' L<br>b.	10- Lane 40'W X 40' L<br>3.

Set-up and tear-down of the shelters shall not exceed 8 hours with a four (2) man crew<br><br>Based on industries feedback and the training benefits, PEO STRI plans on developing its acquisition approach. <br>BACKGROUND: The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments. The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges. It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios. It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC). Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces. <br>The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training. Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range. Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications. Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification. <br>Additional information on the EST itself is located on PEO STRI's website. <br>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  The Government would NOT be providing any GFE other than the EST and its simulated weapons.<br>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The Government is interested in receiving your insight on what is the best methodology for mobilizing the EST to maximize home station training at a reduced cost.  Responses should include the following information: a) your company name, address, POC, email addresses, phone and fax numbers, and company's web page (if applicable); b) identification of business size as it relates to NAICS code 332311, i.e. US large or small business (SB), service disabled veteran business, HUB Zone, 8(a) certified business, Woman Owned SB, etc; c) short history of your firm's experience in providing relevant similar products/services; d) every page of your response must include your company's name as well as page number, i.e. page # of 15. The suggested page count is no more than 15 pages. Font is not to be smaller than 12 points. <br><br>Submit RFI responses via e-mail by 1600 Eastern Standard Time (EST) NLT 16 July 2012, to the following e-mail address: <br>Jessica.jackson3@us.army.mil;  Patricia.Hyland@us.army.mil; Robert.DeGaine@us.army.mil; Pete.Walton1@us.army.mil; and Sara.Creely@us.army.mil. <br><br>1.  Please describe in detail your proposed suggestion for mobilizing the EST (5 lanes as well as 10 lanes) so that Army, National Guard and Army Reserve can maximize the usage of their existing EST for home station training.  <br>2.  Please provide ROM for mobilization of a 5-lane system and a 10-lane system, as well as production lead-time.<br>3. Would there be any special tools/equipment required for your deployable approach? <br>4.  Please describe preventative maintenance and maintenance requirements for your approach.<br>5.  Please identify if your firm would be a prime of sub for this proposed acquisition.<br><br>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the FAR. (b) Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement. There is no solicitation available at this time. <br><br>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: PEO STRI Acquisition Center, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276<br><br>POINTS OF CONTACT: <br>Jessica Jackson, Contract Specialist, 407-208-3263<br>Patricia Hyland, Contracting Officer, 407-384-3754<br>Major DeGaine, Project Director, 407-384-3732<br>Pete Walton, Lead System Engineer, 407-380-4728 <br>

There is a technical problem which is inhibiting the posting of all PWS updates associated with Amendment 0008 published on 6/22/2012 under Update 13.  The documents will be posted to the solicitation site upon resolution of the technical issues. However in order to facilitate the timely receipt of the recent PWS changes by interested parties, this Special Notice is being used as a temporary vehicle to communicate those changes.  Please direct any comments or concerns directly to me.  Sincerely, CDR John H.

NMCI provides end-to-end secure Information Technology (IT) services to more than 400,000 seats and 800,000 users, across 2,500+ USN and USMC locations that vary from major bases to single user locations.   NMCI has been operated under the programmatic and operational oversight of the DON until the end of the contract period of performance, September 30, 2010.  On October 1, 2010, the DON transitioned to the NMCI Continuity of Services Contract (CoSC), for the continued delivery of NMCI services to the DON, through April 30, 2014 (if all options are exercised).  The DON intends to transition IT services from CoSC to the follow-on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract(s). The primary goals of NGEN are to: 1) operate the NMCI network while maintaining delivery of NMCI network and computing services; 2) support the NMCI network and associated computing services from requirement identification to service disposal; 3) ensure continued security of the network and proactive enhancement of information assurance (IA) capabilities to meet evolving and emerging threats; 4) provide Government Command and Control (C2) to ensure flexible and responsive operation and defense of the network; 5) leverage DoD enterprise security services provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to meet user requirements as technically and fiscally feasible and approved by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA); and 6) maintain continuity of service during transition from NMCI CoSC to follow-on NGEN contract(s) or Government operation. The Government anticipates firm fixed price, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for the Transport and Enterprise Services requirements.  Award will be made to the offeror or combination of offerors that results in the lowest total combined price to the Government for the transition to, and operation and maintenance of the Next Generation Enterprise Network. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering amounts. The prospective contract will have a one-year base period with four one-year options.  This is a full and open competition. With the exception of attachments J-18, J-27, J-28, J-38 and J-43, this RFP has been released with all supporting attachments.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell lock in Massena, New York. Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is in service from late March until late December each year. Typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room&nbsp;for transiting vessels. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The project includes installation of seven (7) steel pipes approximately 50 feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of 12 square feet with cross sections varying from rectangular to round. These pipes shall be embedded in the upstream concrete miter gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gate valves having openings 5 feet - 7 inches wide and 2 feet - 3 inches high with one (1) valve being electrically operated and the other manually operated. The work will require removal of approximately 1,800 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery through the miter gate sill at the lock. The work will also include connecting the knife gate actuators to an existing power source, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work&nbsp;to be performed inside&nbsp;the lock will need to be completed during the 2013 winter shutdown period beginning in January 2013 during an approximate ten (10) week period when the lock is dewatered. Work in the gallery through the miter gate sill that will not interfere with navigation shall be accomplished during the 2013 Navigation Season which begins in late March 3013. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Cost range for this project&nbsp;will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a contractor to construct/install an ice flushing system at Snell lock in Massena, New York. Snell Lock is a navigation lock that is 80 feet wide and 860 feet long from gate to gate and&nbsp;raises and lowers vessels approximately 43 feet. Snell Lock is in service from late March until late December each year. Typically during the opening and closing periods, ice needs to be flushed from the lock to make room&nbsp;for transiting vessels. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The project includes installation of seven (7) steel pipes approximately 50 feet in length having approximate cross-sectional areas of 12 square feet with cross sections varying from rectangular to round. These pipes shall be embedded in the upstream concrete miter gate sill with intakes upstream of the miter gate and outlets in the downstream face of the sill. Each pipe will be fitted with two (2) knife gate valves having openings 5 feet - 7 inches wide and 2 feet - 3 inches high with one (1) valve being electrically operated and the other manually operated. The work will require removal of approximately 1,800 cubic yards of concrete and placement of approximately 1,000 cubic yards of steel reinforced concrete to install the steel pipes and to enlarge a concrete gallery through the miter gate sill at the lock. The work will also include connecting the knife gate actuators to an existing power source, integrating the controls for the new valves with the existing lock operating controls and installing a new access stairway. The work&nbsp;to be performed inside&nbsp;the lock will need to be completed during the 2013 winter shutdown period beginning in January 2013 during an approximate ten (10) week period when the lock is dewatered. Work in the gallery through the miter gate sill that will not interfere with navigation shall be accomplished during the 2013 Navigation Season which begins in late March 3013. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Cost range for this project&nbsp;will be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to add information to the synopsis issued on June 19, 2012.  Regarding any publication of the work under this order, USGS tsunami project scientists will take the lead in publication.  The contractor will be a co-author, where appropriate.  The choice of whether to publish in a journal or as a USGS report will be made by the USGS scientists.  Required submittals for evaluation will be sent to USGS via email to jstevenson@usgs.gov.  This requirement consists of a base period and one option period.  The contractor will not perform any surveys, but needs knowledge of geodetic control surveys, single beam or multibeam bathymetric surveys and topographic surveys using RTK GPS, or total station.  This project uses a variety of remotely sensed data including satellite data, LiDAR and aerial photos.  The contractor must be familiar with these data types and must be able to analyze the data to the point where it meets project objectives for reports.  Tsunami project data is available for the project but downloading available imagery may also be needed. No new imagery will be collected.  No purchase of specific planned satellite sensor missions is anticipated.  No planning or leading field expeditions are contemplated.  The contractor must have knowledge of all techniques used by USGS for grain size analysis (laser diffraction, settling columns, sieving) but will not be required to perform that analysis.  The contractor will not be responsible for any geochemical studies for the tsunami project.  No isotope studies on sediments on sediments collected for this study are contemplated.  The NAICS Size Standard is corrected to $14M.  This requirement includes a base year from September 16, 2012 to September 15, 2013 and an option year from September 16, 2013 to September 15, 2014.  The closing date remains the same at July 11, 2012.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Terminus Media in Atlanta, GA. The purpose of this procurement is is to obtain four additional, motion comic episodes designed to educate young people about HIV/STI that can be viewed on a variety of internet-capable platforms including the desktop computers, laptop computers, video gaming systems (e.g. PS3, XBOX), wireless phones and tablet computers (e.g. iPad, Xoom, Galaxy). This procurement is a follow-on order to an original procurement. Termimus Media is deemed to be the only responsible source as it is the original source, and the only vendor able to ensure continuity of the episodes. An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of time and cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services Please send your documentation to Sharon Cunningham at the office identified above, by email at cux0@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within discretion of the government.

<DESC>It is imperative that all office furniture being procured interface with existing furniture as found in various other procurement facilities at ACC-NJ. All furniture in the contract centers for ACC-NJ must have the same Form Fit and Function to ensure that necessary office configuration changes have a minimal impact on our daily business practices. Currently all office furniture interfaces are the same in buildings 1610, 10, 10B, and 9. This same continuity must be present in all contracting facilities at ACC-NJ to accommodate a reorganization or expansion. The shape, size, dimensions, and the ability of a part to physically interface with, connect to, or become an integral part of another part is vital to minimize interruptions in our operations. Manufacturers of office furniture utilize different types of interface parts. This difference in interfacing parts will hinder the acquisitions centers ability to quickly reorganize a building layout to accommodate the evolving face of contracting.
