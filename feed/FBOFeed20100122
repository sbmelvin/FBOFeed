<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) for the Psion Teklogix System Upgrade. The Psion Teklogix System Upgrade is in accordance with new security mandates (802.11) imposed in Tracy California.  This requirement will provide radio frequency equipment for Tracy, California, DDJC, by upgrading access points and implementing a new version of Map RF that includes Intrusion Detection System. This procurement has a period of performance form 8 March, 2010 thru 19 March, 2010.

Psion Teklogix is the only source that can provide these services to the current system operating in our DDC Depots.  This current system is from Psion Teklogix and is a standard across DDC depots.  No other vendors are authorized by Psion Teklogix to provide the items pertinent to this requirement.  Psion Teklogix will provide the Intrusion Detection System software and installation services. Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this service, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to Psion Teklogix for Systems Upgrade.


Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The performance of this procurement will begin 8 March, 2010 and continue through 19 March, 2010.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511 with a small business dollar standard of $25,000,000.00. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the System Upgrade by 3:00 PM EDT, Friday February 05, 2010 to Joshua Bell, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6081, FAX:  717-770-7591, or e-mail:  Joshua.bell@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  If no affirmative responses are received by 3:00 PM EDT, Friday February 05, 2010 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to Psion Teklogix.

<DESC><p>*NOTE: This is a pre-solicitation notice, not a solicitation. The solicitation HAS NOT yet been issued. Solicitation will not be issued until after February 8, 2010. Once issued, the solicitation will provide a closing date of 30 days after the issue date.</p>
<p>RFP SPM1C1-10-R-0059 will be for the purchase of T-Shirt, IPFU, Short Sleeve. NSN: 8415-01-465-7071(S). CRFD/PD 99-05.</p>
<p>Description:<br />Indefinite Delivery Type Contract with Base Term, plus Four (4) One Year Term Options.</p>
<p>The following Indefinite Delivery Type Contract (IDTC) is anticipated:</p>
<p>This information is for solicitation SPM1C1-10-R-0059. The item is T-Shirt, IPFU, Short Sleeve. NSN: 8415-01-465-7071(S) Military Spec: CRFD/PD 99-05, pattern date is listed as September 13, 2000.

The first delivery order is due 120 days after the date of the award. The destination for the item is VSEQ Lion Vallen, Suffolk, VA. <br /><br />CAUTION NOTICE:<br />In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, this acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable." Also, unlike previous acquisitions for commercial items, there will be no allowable re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. Successful offeror(s) will be awarded the entire contract, therefore, offeror must offer on base year and all option years.</p>
<p>Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Offeror should register to receive notification of this solicitation or solicitation amendments.

<DESC><p>The Eastern&nbsp;Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA, on behalf of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Narragansett, RI. , intends to issue a solicitation for the management of NOAA's Resident Research Associateship Program. NOAA has an ongoing requirement to foster the capability to attract and retain high quality research associates in order to consistently advance its research objectives. The pursuit of scientific research of the highest quality requires that ideas, knowledge, skills and information be disseminated throughout the NOAA labs. Conversely, the ideas, knowledge, skills and information that currently exists within the NOAA labs needs to be disseminated throughout the larger scientific community. These two types of transfers are facilitated by the process whereby the very best scientists and experienced senior scientists have an opportunity to work in the NOAA labs, collaborating with NOAA scientists. This is accomplished by a NOAA-wide Resident Research Associateship Program. Research is accomplished through this program in the fields of Meteorology, Climate and Air Quality, Earth Sciences, Hydrology, Oceanography, Limnology, Space Sciences, Fisheries and Marine Mammals, Toxicology, Quantitative Ecology, Environmental Modeling, Molecular Biology, and Physiology and Microbiology. Specific tasks for this program include establishing or renewing sub-agreements for up to 90 research associates; managing a recruitment, selection, and stipend distribution process that attracts domestic and foreign national post-doctoral and senior research scientists of the highest caliber to conduct research in NOAA laboratories on science topics of interest to NOAA. This involves managing a process that works closely with respected, degree-granting engineering and science institutions and organizations to provide high visibility for the research opportunities; conducting scientific review of NOAA research scientists nominated as Research Advisers to the Research Associates and of NOAA sponsoring facilities; assembling highly experienced review panels of pre-eminent scientists to assess and rank research proposals by prospective Associates based on their scientific merit; communicating and coordinating with applicants, Awardees, Research Advisers, and the NOAA Program Representative; providing sufficient documentation and information to the NOAA Program Representative on applicant status, Advisers status, and Associates status; negotiating stipend levels and obtaining approved from the NOAA Program Representative; serving as the U.S. sponsor of foreign nationals for visa acquisition; and providing a process and procedures as well as coordinating receipt of applications, reviews, recommendations, progress evaluations of associates, adviser nominations, sponsoring lab exit interview and; providing necessary guidance and appropriate forms to foreign nationals for U.S. visa acquisition. The planned period of performance for this effort is July 31, 2010 through July 30, 2011 with four option years. Request for Proposal (RFP) EA133F-10-RP-0022 will be available on or about February 5, 2010 through the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Proposals will be due 30 days thereafter. Award of the contract is anticipated for July 31, 2010. The basis for proposal evaluation, in descending order of importance will be Technical Approach, Past Performance, Contractor Resources, and Management Approach. The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690 with a size standard of $7.0M. This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation, on an unrestricted basis. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps registration feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download on all postings associated with the solicitation. Each potential offeror is responsible for checking this website to gain all the updates or amendments to any and all documents. No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued. No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted. All responsible, responsive sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>PROJECT NAME:  ARRA-funded remedial repair of Floodwater Retarding Dam (RFD) 53 in the Wet Walnut Watershed District No. 58, Subwatershed No. 5

SOLICITATION TYPE: Invitation for bids, full and open competition.

CONTRACT TYPE: Fixed Price.

ESTIMATED PRICE RANGE:  Between $250,000 and $500,000.

LOCATION:  Ness County, Kansas 

SUMMARY:  Work will include front slope armoring and a toe drain on a floodwater retarding dam.  The upstream wave protection slope has experienced erosion due to wave action, and the downstream toe is experiencing significant seepage on the left abutment.  The repair of the wave protection slope involves replacing eroded material on the 12:1 slope and placement of a rock riprap wave barrier along the length of the slope to break incoming waves.  The toe drain installation will involve placement of fine drainfill and about 400 feet of perforated collection pipe along and to the left of the principal spillway, as well as solid pipe to discharge the flow to the stilling basin.  To reduce the trenching depth for the drain, the top five feet of the downstream stability berm (back berm) over the length of the drain will be excavated before the drain installation and then replaced.  In addition, a length of fence will be temporarily removed for construction of the drain and then rebuilt. The repaired areas and other associated disturbed areas will be reseeded to native grass.

TIME FRAMES/DATE:   Solicitation packet is tentatively scheduled for posting February 8, 2010, with bid opening tentatively scheduled for March 10, 2010.  It is anticipated construction will commence on or about April 15, 2010, and work will be completed by approximately June 30, 2010. 

Prospective contractors must obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  A DUNS number can be obtain by calling the Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com.

<DESC>"THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY." THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CLARK/BALFOUR BEATTY (CBB) JOINT VENTURE AS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.
TITLE: RENOVATION OF OPERATING ROOMS AT NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MARYLAND. 
This proposed contract action based on other than full and open competition will be a firm-fixed price, sole source award to CBB for design build RFP development and Post Award Construction Services (PCAS).  It was requested that other than full and open competition be permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (2) as implemented by the FAR 6.302-1 - only one responsible source.
The CBB team is already responsible for repair, upgrade and reconfiguration of 17 existing Operating Rooms (OR) as well as the reconfiguration and renovation of adjacent supporting spaces and systems including mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure to create ORs that fully comply with DOD unified facilities criteria.  A separate project, BRAC design/build contract awarded to CBB, requires the addition of three (3) state-of-the-art ORs to the existing MC OR suite.  These three new ORs will enable the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) to perform specialized surgery now performed at the current Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).  These three new Ors under the BRAC program are required to facilitate the closing of WRAMC. Due to their long-term involvement with the project, CBB is well versed in the hospital's requirements, as they are nearly identical to those of the original.
The estimated release of the RFP is the 29th of January 2010.  The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation notice.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI intends to award a Firm-Fixed price contract on a sole source basis to Brown University for Technical and Engineering Services in support of the Polymer Coating Laboratory. Brown University is the only available source for the required services. Brown University personnel, specifically Professor Kyung-Suk Kim, have the unique knowledge and experience in the contact and fabrication mechanics of soft materials. The amount of time required for any other source to acquire the adequate knowledge to perform this requirement would result in unacceptable delays. 
The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Further details will be released upon issue of RFQ # N66604-10-Q-1411, which is anticipated to be on or about 02/08/2010. For information on this acquisition please contact Alison Wicks at 401-832-8277 alison.c.wicks@navy.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Anticipating Unintended Consequences of Health Information Technology and Health Information Exchange
<SOLNBR>OS25788
<RESPDATE>022610
<CONTACT>Allison C Ford, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0101, Fax 301-443-1004, Email aford@psc.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

The purpose of this contract is to create a mechanism to consider and address the undesirable and potentially harmful unintended consequences of activities supported by ONC in coordination with other Federal agencies, including activities related to meaningful use of certified Electronic Health Records (EHR) technology.  The goal is to avoid, mitigate, and track undesirable unintended consequences.  To the extent possible, the intent of the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) is to implement programs that enormously improve the quality and efficiency of health care.  But good intentions are often not enough.  This contract honors the ancient injunction to physicians, First, do no harm.

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and specifically Title XIII, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, established by law the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within the Department of Health and Human Services.  This project will be funded from ARRA funds Congress appropriated to support the activities of the ONC under HITECH.   

The National Coordinator bears the obligation to undertake activities consistent with the development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information and that will, within a secure and protected environment -- 
	Improve quality, reduce errors and health disparities, and advance patient-centered health care; 
	Reduce costs resulting from inefficiency, errors, inappropriate or duplicative care, and Incomplete information; 
	Provide information to guide treatments decisions at the point of care; 
	Improve coordination among hospitals, laboratories, physician offices and other entities; 
	Improve public health and the rapid response to threats and emergencies, including bioterrror and infectious disease outbreaks; 
	Facilitate research; 
	Promote early detection, prevention, and management of chronic diseases; and
	Promote a more effective marketplace, greater competition, greater systems analysis, increased consumer choice, and improved health care outcomes. 

Toward these ends, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has taken steps to provide financial incentives to physicians and hospitals for adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology that has the capacity to provide clinical decision support and computerized provider order entry, among many other features.  DHHS has also taken steps toward creation of a nationwide health information infrastructure, including a governance mechanism; certification of EHR technology; creation of state health exchanges; enhanced privacy and security measures; and improved means of communication between patients and their caregivers, among other activities.  

While we expect for these programs to help achieve the many desirable outcomes envisioned by Congress, a sense of responsibility for activities we support, historical experience, as well as mounting evidence of unexpected problems, demand that we consider potential downsides.  

Over the duration of this contract, we will create and support a panel of experts and related work groups to identify and explore potentially undesirable or harmful unintended consequences.  By unintended consequences we mean outcomes that are not intended, even though, upon investigation and reflection, they are, at least in part, a natural consequence of the activities.  While some unintended consequences are desirable, the purpose of this contract is to identify and address those that are undesirable and potentially harmful.    
 

An award for Competitive RFTOP OS25788 will be made from the Program Support Center Task Order Contracts.  All of the PSC Task Order Contractors received notification of the requirement.  If you were not awarded a PSC Task Order Contract you can not be considered for an award as the prime contractor for this requirement.  However, there may be subcontracting opportunities.  If you are interested in subcontracting with one of the PSC Task Order Contractors, you must contact the PSC Task Order Contractors. The list of PSC Contractors is posted on FEBIZOPPS (web-address below).  Once you reach the webpage, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the hyperlink entitled Contract list xls.

Requirements exist for support services in the following locations: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC, Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Baltimore, MD, and the Aviation Training Center (ATC) in Mobile, AL.
<p>Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) has long been employed by Coast Guard Air Stations as a means to track maintenance actions and operational data of Coast Guard aircraft; specifically the Electronic Asset Logbook (EAL) and Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) functions of the system.

Based upon the success of the system, the Logistics Transformation Program Integration Office (LTPIO) will be expanding the use of ALMIS to include all assets in the Coast Guard. The Decision Support System (DSS) is a module in ALMIS that provides; integrated help, web reports and Power Play Cubes. A cube is a file that is created by aggregating data along a number of dimensions and storing it in such a way that it can be accessed quickly. All the dimensions in this cube can be accessed and changed in a rapid manner. The data might be operational hours including dimensions such as time, unit, and asset number. Coast Guard active duty, government employees and some contractors located at Coast Guard Headquarter\Areas\Districts\Air Stations\Sectors\Groups\Units and Cutters must be trained to gain the ability to perform operational and maintenance data entry and analysis using ALMIS.

<a href="mailto:renee.prendergast@us.army.mil">Renee Prendergast</a>
<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L
LCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ in support of the Project
Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently
seeking qualified sources capable of manufacturing, inspecting and delivering
the FMU-153/B Point Detonating (PD)/Delay Fuze (DLY).

The FMU 153/B fuze may be set for either Point Detonating (PD) or Delay (DLY)
depending on the type of target.  In the PD mode the fuze may be used against
soft targets or for registration on hard targets.  In the delay mode the fuze
may be used against hard targets where penetration is desired.  The FMU 153/B
fuze is basically the same as the MK399 MOD1, except for a heavier nose
section, for use in Air Force 105mm weapons against Air Force ground targets.
The FMU 153/B PD/Delay fuze is a combination of two (2) proven fuze designs:
The MK399 MOD1 and the MK407 MOD1 PD/Delay fuzes.  The combination is the
packaging of the internal components from the MK407 MOD1 into the body of the
MK399 MOD1.  The repackaging was direct and simple since the cavities in the
fuze bodies are the same dimensions.  Therefore, there was no need to redesign
parts or closing screws due to size changes.  There were minor design changes
to the Safe Arming Mechanism to reflect the Army's arming requirement.  These
changes removed two (2) gear teeth from the sector gear and weakened the spin
lock springs.  This would facilitate arming the fuze at 400 calibers from the
weapon at all spin rates observed from the weapon.
 The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of multiple Firm
Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to
deliver the Air Force FY11-FY20 FMU 153/B PD/DLY fuze production
requirements.  It is anticipated that multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded
for a basic ordering period of five years with an option for additional
ordering periods of five years. 
The minimum FMU 153/B PD/DLY Fuze order expected in any one year will be no
less than 20,000 fuzes up to a maximum quantity of 37,000 Fuzes for each
ordering period.

Potential contractors possessing the technical, financial and facility
resources necessary to meet the Governments requirements will initially be
qualified by being awarded an IDIQ contract and then compete for delivery
orders as requirements arise.  All facilities must have safety clearance to
handle hazard classifications. 

Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience and
capability, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble,
and inspect the required quantities of FMU 153/B and obtain the necessary 
equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver these
fuzes. This may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a
required production line.  Contractors shall provide a summary of their
companys capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of
contact identification, capabilities, a description of facilities/equipment,
manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel, past experience as
a manufacturer of artillery fuzes, proven monthly production capacity and/or
potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements and whether the
company is a large or small business. 

Responses to this survey should represent the contractors best attempt to
deliver first production quantities twelve months after contract award.

This information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government
within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication. Note that the
information provided will not be returned. Firms with experiences in the areas
cited above should provide a summary of their companys capabilities including
a description of their facilities, personnel and past experience to meet this
requirement to: Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality
Contracting Center,  CCJM-CA, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Attn:
Renee Prendergast, or submit the information electronically to
renee.prendergast@us.army.mil.   TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The
Government will accept written questions by email.

This is a Sources Sought/Market Survey Announcement only and should not be
construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the U.S. Government.
All information collected from this market survey shall be used for planning
purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the
basis of this market survey.  Please identify any proprietary information
submitted.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.
Should a formal solicitation be anticipated a solicitation notice will be
published at a later date with more detailed technical requirements provided.

<DESC>M4 CARBINE MODIFICATION KITMarket Survey AnnouncementW15QKN-10-X-0435
The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC), Joint Munitions and Lethality (JM&L) Contracting Center is seeking companies with experience in small arms manufacturing and associated technologies (corporate knowledge, technical expertise, facilities, manufacturing equipment, and product acceptance test hardware).  The Government is seeking to test and potentially qualify a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Modification Kit for improvements to the M4 Carbine.  It is anticipated that the modification kit be evaluated as a system and be able to drop-in/be installed to stock M4 Carbines.  It is the Governments intent (via the application of this Modification) to provide measurable improvements in reliability, durability, and maintainability of the M4.  Specific areas of interest may include but shall not be limited to the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, upper receiver and barrel assembly, gas operating system, trigger group assembly, and robust MIL-STD-1913 rail system (Picatinny Rail).  All upgrade possibilities are encouraged and welcome, from replacement of individual components up to and including the replacement of the entire upper receiver.  There are no anticipated modifications to the standard lower receiver; however minor modifications to the trigger mechanism and the interface of the upper to lower receiver may also be submitted.  The weapon must retain the existing 5.56x45mm caliber (M855, NATO SS109).  The application of the Modification Kit must not result in the diminution of any performance characteristic associated with the current M4 Carbine.  The estimated quantity that may be required by the Government is 500,000 each.
Interested firms should submit literature/brochures not exceeding twenty (20) pages describing product technical capabilities, design details and operational characteristics, and production capability (monthly sustainable production rate). Submissions shall also include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit price (per kit) estimate for the following quantity ranges 500-1,000; 1,001-5,000; 5,001-10,000 and 10,001-20,000 for each production year from FY12 thru FY17.  The ROM will be used for planning purposes only.  If alternate production range bands provide for more economical pricing, it is requested that those also be provided, but not to exceed four bands.  The Government respectfully requests that all interested vendors provide responses to this notice on or before 16 February 2010, however responses that are submitted beyond this date will also be accepted.  Please submit responses to U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, CCJM-SW, ATTN: David DeCandia, Building 9, Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. 07806-5000.

In the event that additional information is sought, all responders are required to provide the following contact information:  Contractor name and address; point of contact with telephone number and email address; size of business; and country represented.
This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This Market Survey is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)is performing Market Research to determine capabilities in the marketplace for performing Technical Support for the Production of Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System Payment Rates<br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE: </strong>This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses/small disadvantaged businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide technical support for the production of Medicare outpatient prospective payment system payment rates for CY 2012. The information/Capability Statements obtained from this market research will be considered in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC. <br />
<p><br />THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ATTACHED DRAFT SOW. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT </span>ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br />Under Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act, CMS is required to update the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) on an annual basis. Among the factors that fall within the scope of that annual review are the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) payment groups, relative payment weights, the wage and other adjustments made by CMS to take into account changes in medical practice, the addition of new services, and new cost data. The annual update is made on a calendar year basis, through rulemaking and by law must be made public no later than 60 days before implementation at the beginning of the following calendar year.</p>
<p>The OPPS is considered by many inside and outside the government to be the most complex of the various Medicare fee-for-service payment systems. It has characteristics of both a prospective payment system and a fee schedule, but is neither in its entirety. The system is idiosyncratic in numerous respects and requires extensive hands-on experience to understand. Yet, CMS must use this complicated and often cumbersome system to establish payments for tens of millions of outpatient services that are furnished each year to beneficiaries at approximately 5,000 hospitals. The CY 2010 update of OPPS rates was based on information extracted from approximately 140 million claim records and the most recent cost report data submitted to Medicare by those hospitals.<br /><br />The OPPS proposed and final rules establishing the payment rates from 2000 to 2010 describe the OPPS rate-setting methodology in detail. (See http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HospitalOutpatientPPS/HORD/list.asp#TopOfPage for a list of OPPS proposed and final rules.) Moreover, there is a "claims accounting", an even more detailed description of the data process, provided under the supporting documentation for the proposed and final rules.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS/INFORMATION: </strong>In order for CMS to assess a firm's capability, Capability Statements, submitted in response this SSN, shall include written responses that demonstrate the necessary knowledge, experience and ability to meet the SOW requirements. Specifically, Capability Statements (not exceeding 10 pages) shall include sufficient detail that clearly demonstrates your ability to provide the following services:</p>
<p>1. Policy, clinical, data analysis, and programming experience in developing a comprehensive system of healthcare claims based payment rates for the public or private sector. For example, developing a comprehensive system of claims based healthcare payment rates for outpatient hospital services, inpatient hospital services, physician services, or another significant health care sector. Provide specifics of the policy aspects, clinical aspects, data analysis aspects and programming aspects of the experience and the dates of such experience. (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT).</p>
<p>2. Experience developing policy options for modifications to a comprehensive system of health care claims based payment rates for the public or private sector, including the following: evaluations of the advantages and disadvantages of such modifications from a clinical and policy perspective, modeling such modifications using healthcare claims and accounting data, estimating the impact of such modifications on patients and providers of the clinical services, and integrating the modifications into the existing comprehensive payment system. (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT).</p>
<p>3. Experience with complex programming in mainframe Statistical Analysis System (SAS) and Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL). Experience manipulating Healthcare Cost Reporting Information System (HCRIS) data and Medicare claims data of the type found on the standard uniform bill (UB-04) bill types 12X, 13X, and 14X. Experience with the Integrated Outpatient Code Editor (IOCE) and the OPPS Pricer.</p>
<p>4. Experience producing specialized claims Medicare outpatient hospital data from CMS data systems using nontechnical specifications developed by policy analysts. Provide specifics of experience and dates of such experience.<br /><br />5. Capability, capacity and willingness to produce data on an "as needed" basis, without a previously known or fixed schedule, including responding to urgent data requests nights, weekends and holidays, except for defined periods of time that are agreed to in advance by the project officer.</p>
<p>6. Experience with the CMS and other governmental rules and regulations concerning privacy and use of confidential data.</p>

The breath of scope of this project will be dependent on available resources. The retail pricing will then be fed to a set of consumer Energy Service Interface (ESI) Gateways for monitoring and control. The price feed will be converted within the ESI Gateway into a form compatible with systems within a commercial and industrial facility.</p>
<p>Wholesale pricing information is currently available from ISO's (i.e. New England ISO, Midwest ISO, New York ISO, PJM) as 5-minute LMP (location marginal price) values. Each location-based price is associated with a specific location code. The 5-minute LMP represents the wholesale energy price for the last or next 5-minute period. This information must be transformed into actionable pricing data.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to validate and verify the NIST-sanctioned pricing information models and standards through the tangible demonstration and use of real-time price information flowing in the pricing supply chain. Primary objectives are to:</p>
<p>1. Identify and provide proposed solutions for specific roadblocks and obstacles that impede the use of real-time pricing in commercial and industrial applications;<br />2. Provide feedback to the NIST process and ongoing DOE and NIST projects in a timely manner;<br />3. Evaluate interoperability at all levels of the GridWise Architecture Counsel (GWAC) Sack; and <br />4. Provide input for the standardization of a commercial/industrial ESI Gateway.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center (NIH CC) Pharmacy Department in Bethesda Maryland is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The NIH CC Pharmacy Department is seeking a Medication Barcode Enabled Automated Point of Care Technology (MBEAPOCT) System that will automate error-resistant patient care processes to improve efficiency, effectiveness and patient safety for Medication administration. The proposed system must integrate with the existing Barcode Initiative which includes admission/registration, specimen collection, and blood administration, Laboratory Specimen Collection. This project will be implemented on all inpatient units, day hospitals and outpatient clinics only for administrations of medications, as well as clinical procedure and diagnostic service areas in the NIH Clinical Center complex. <br />These include:<br />&bull; 13 inpatient units<br />&bull; 17 outpatient clinics<br />&bull; 3 day-hospitals<br />&bull; 11 clinical treatment and diagnostic areas, including OR/PACU, Cardiac Catheterization, Special Procedures, Nuclear Medicine, Outpatient Phlebotomy, Occupational Medicine Service, Blood Bank, Apheresis Clinic, Bronchoscopy, Endoscopy and Critical Care STAT Lab.<br />The barcode-enabled, automated point of care technology (MBEAPOCT) solution is intended to address hospital-wide processes for medication administrations and to be integrated with the existing barcode initiatives for Positive Patient Identification.</p>
<p>The system shall provide the ability to support the medication administration process, including verification of the right patient, right drug, right dose, right strength, right time and right route of administration and clinical reason as appropriate. Bar Code Aided Medication Administration (BCMA) involves the commitment of prescriber, pharmacist, nurse and patient to a safer and more efficient process surrounding the medication function. <br />A significant portion of medications provided for patient at point of care do not have a vendor supplied bar code. These products may be subunits of vendor supplied items (unit dose tabs or caps, or compounded half tablets or suspensions prepared from oral tablets or capsules); or parenteral products compounded in the pharmacy. At the Clinical Center, a significant number of these items are not even supplied by a commercial vendor, but as experimental products compounded in house or supplied as blinded materials by outside vendors. It will be the task of the bar code solution vendor to identify a way to integrate these disparate products while honoring (or improving) the work flows which produce these items. <br />The environments for medication administration in the Clinical Center include unit-based care, procedure rooms, operating suites, post-op care units, outpatient clinics and outpatient pharmacy. Unique also in this environment is the use of the medical record number rather than visit number to differentiate patients, so that orders for inpatient visits and outpatient treatments or prescriptions are available at any location <br />Inpatients: The Clinical Center consists of 13 inpatient units including an Intensive Care Unit totaling 234 beds maximum capacity (140-160 filled on average), 3 day hospitals, and 2400 inpatient doses filled by the Central Pharmacy per week day. The Pharmacy supplies medications currently through limited floor stock, automated dispensing machines (Omnicell), central 24 hour cart fill, and with interim doses sent to the nurse or the cart via pneumatic tube or courier delivery. <br />Outpatients: Administration of medications is performed in the day hospitals, some outpatient locations and in the special procedure areas.<br />Capture devices should be described for bedside use, procedure room use, day hospital use, outpatient clinics and operating room use.</p>
<p>The proposed MBEAPOCT system must:<br />&bull; Integrate with the CareFusion Transfusion Verification and Specimen Collection Verification Systems to allow NIH Staff transparently perform transfusion verification, specimen collection and medication administration. <br />&bull; Utilize existing Flo Healthcare 1760 Mobile Workstation which are planned for each patient room, outpatient care unit and procedure area with bar-code reader and Zebra QL Plus Series Label Printers. <br />&bull; Utilize existing MC70 Enterprise Digital Assistants Zebra QL Plus Series Label Printers planned for selected areas. <br />&bull; Utilize existing patient wallet card and wristbands.<br />The contractor(s) providing the services must have the requisite experience in furnishing, installing and maintaining bar-code medication administration systems in a hospital environment. They should have installed these systems in at least five hospital facilities. The contractor(s) must have experience developing and supporting interfaces as described above to their information system. The contractor must also be able to provide system support on a 24/7 basis. <br /><br />The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the following items. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm. The vendor response must specifically address each of the following areas:<br /><br />1) Experience: The capability statement shall show that the vendor has sufficient relevant experience to do the work. The contractor(s) will list the institutions where their system is installed, how long it has been installed, and the number of prescriptions filled per day at that institution. At least one of these institutions must have an interface from a prescriber order entry system to their system and at least one must regularly fill prescriptions for investigational drugs.</p>
<p>2) References: The capability statement shall present a listing of at least five present clients. The name, address, contact telephone number and the contact person must be stated for the five required references.</p>
<p>3) Training: The capability statement should clearly demonstrate that the firm has qualified personnel who have installed bar-code medication administration systems. The vendor(s) shall provide a list of the principal people who will be involved in the project including their training and experience related to information technology.</p>
<p>The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".</p>
<p>Vendors must send written capability responses by February 5, 2010 to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address [Ann Argaman aargaman@cc.nih.gov . The written responses must also indicate the size of your firm- small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business For any questions, please contact the contract specialist, Ms. Ann Argaman at (301) 594-5919.]</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business concerns; (2) whether there are small businesses HUBZone small business, service-disabled, veteran-owned business or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

The NAICS code for this project is 622110.
The small business size standard is $34.5  million in annual receipts.

Background

This project is a projected recompetition of an existing contract which provides human specimens from donors with histopathology and epidemiology data linked to tissues from subjects with cancer, pre-cancerous conditions, non-cancer donors and hospitalized and non-hospitalized control volunteers. 

This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200577000C held by the University of Maryland, Baltimore.

Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this procurement is to collect malignant tissues and adjacent and uninvolved target-organ tissues plus blood, blood components and urine from cancer patients at the time of surgery and blood, blood components, urine and other fluid substances such as sputum from normal non-hospitalized matched controls, accompanied by completed questionnaires containing occupation, health and social histories of each volunteer.

As part of the work under this potential contract semiannual, annual and a final technical report are expected.

Project Requirements

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:
A. Recruitment of and Specimen Collection from Case-Control Participants:
1) Document the relevant patient populations enrolling annually in the medical
institutions in Baltimore, Maryland and surrounding counties in the metropolitan vicinity that will be targeted as potential participants in the patient accrual and specimen collection efforts for case-control studies of cancers of the lung, prostate, liver and the pancreas Obtain the necessary approvals and written agreements (i e ,
Study protocol; consent forms, etc,) for the study activities from Internal Review Boards, Chairpersons, Division Heads and key personnel (surgeons, pathologists, etc )
to insure the cooperation of essential Units and Departments (e g , Admissions, Pulmonary Care, Radiotherapy, Surgery, Pathology, Histology, etc) and personnel (where necessary)

2) Continue (via informed consents) the accrual of a minimum of 2000 (500 each) of
 lung cancer cases before or ASAP after diagnosis and prior to the beginning of  therapy from male and female, Caucasian and African-American patients and
population-based non cancer controls matched by age, gender, race, and locality: specifically: Baltimore, Maryland and surrounding counties in the metropolitan vicinity. Collect malignant tissue specimens and adjacent, uninvolved normal tissues; whole blood, plasma, serum, bully coats, and urine from each enrolled patient that goes to surgery and provide a completed questionnaire administered to each
cooperative enrollee including all relevant information available in the individual medical records.
3)  Complete the accrual of a minimum of 600 cases (120/year) of prostate cancer and 600 population-based non cancer controls (120/year) frequency-matched to cases by gender, age and race. Collect malignant tissue specimens and adjacent, uninvolved normal tissues from each enrolled patient that goes to surgery. The subjects should be of Caucasian and Afro-American origin and from the same general locality
(specifically, Baltimore, Maryland and surrounding counties in the metropolitan vicinity). Controls recruited for this study and the liver and pancreatic cancer studies are shared with the lung cancer study and are included in the targeted number for population-based controls in the lung study.
4) Continue the accrual of a minimum of 500 of primary hepatocellular liver 	carcinomas (HCC), (100/year), 1000 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) 	(200/year), and 1000 population controls (200/year) via the common eligibility for the lung, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancer case control studies from Caucasian, African-American and Asian-American patients and population-based non cancer 	controls frequency matched by gender, race, and locality.. The HCC cases and chronic liver disease cases will require a custom designed liver questionnaire while the population controls will receive the current questionnaire for the lung/prostate studies, Collect blood (including plasma, serum, and buTTY coats) /urine and cheek swabs from all subjects and cancer associated tissue from approximately 20% of HCC patients undergoing surgery.
5)Following the receipt of written approval from NCI-IRB and your local IRB, initiate the accrual of a minimum of 500 primary pancreatic cancer cases (100/year) of Caucasian and African-American origin, 250 cases of chronic pancreatitis and 500 population-based controls matched by age, gender, and race.
6)   Collect from all participants completed NIH designed epidemiology questionnaires, administered via informed consent and computerize in a second NIH designed and provided patient information data base. Maintain and frequently update the epidemiology database to provide periodic reports as requested by the Project Officer
7)  Collect whole blood from all participants and prepare blood components, i.e., red blood cells, white blood cells, serum and/or plasma as requested by the Project Officer Also provide urine from lung, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancer cases and controls at the time of entry into the study, and when surgically available, specimens of tumor and uninvolved, normal appearing adjacent tissues at the time of surgery, from all case-control cancer patients. Package these specimens for immediate or specified delivery intervals to NIH (As described in Deliverables).
8) Receive, prepare and submit lists of cases selected and provided by the Project officer
from the accumulated cases in the study databases for survival searches via the Veteran's Administration Patient Database, Social Security Database, and/or the CDC National Death Index systems
9)  Obtain as frequently as needed from the State of Maryland DMV records of licensed drivers to be used to identify and locate potential volunteers as population controls. Maintain these records as reasonably and efficiently functional up to-date databases (renewed with a frequency to reflect the current populations) in the specific municipalities from which the subjects are being recruited for the case-control studies.

B. Multi-Organ Patient Accrual and Tissue Collections:

In the previous years of this project Multi-Organ tissue collections from all cooperating cases going to surgery and autopsies of non cancer patients represented the primary focus
of the collection activity. With the establishment of case-control studies in 1996, this aspect began to be de-emphasized. Then in 2005 it was reduced to the secondary status of collections from mostly those cases that do not qualify for specified case-control cancer types or specified, limited collections of non active case-control cancer types (esophagus, colon, breast, etc..) using the original questionnaires that are now inactive.
(a)In the current contract, the questionnaires for the two collection categories have been merged. Whenever specified cancer types targeted for case control studies agree to participate but are excluded due to criteria failure, collect the specimens of lung, prostate, liver, and pancreas tissues and fluids (e.g., whole blood and blood (including 	plasma, serum, and buffy coats), urine, and pleural fluids, or a combination of these to a minimum of 50 donors per annum at the time of either pre-surgical diagnosis or surgery, from patients with these cancers but classified as "ineligible for case-control".
(b)Prior to the approval of a Case-Control study of pancreatic cancer, collect a minimum of 100 (per year) of primary pancreatic cases, and the adjacent (surrounding?) noncancerous, uninvolved tissue samples; also 100 cases of chronic pancreatitis tissues (including inflamed and non-inflamed areas) and blood for both plasma and serum preparations from each donor.
C. Epidemiological Data:
(a)In accordance with NIH and OMB regulations, provide isolation and secure storage of completed hard copy questionnaire forms in the Contractor's facility. Provide hard and/or computerized copies of data, coded but without personal identifiers in the physical systems that house the contract data specified for use of the project when requested by the Project Officer .
(b)Provide (from each cooperative donor) an epidemiology profile from extracts of medical records and/or the personal information in completed, NCI-developed, epidemiology questionnaires  administered (via informed consent) by trained and experienced interviewers;
(c)Store and maintain the computerized profiles (without personal identifiers) in an NIH designed, tissue-donor epidemiology database in an "Access" environment, secured according to the Privacy Act requirements.
(d)Conduct interviews with case and control subjects in the field using computer tablets loaded with NIH-programmed software systems for keying in and electronic transfers to compile the data initially on desk-top servers during or after "field" applications and acquisitions.
(e)As required by the LHC investigators and requested via the Project Officer and Prepare and submit lists of select cases in the study for survival searches via the Veteran's Administration Patient Database, the Social Security Database, and the National Death Index.
(f)Provide annually updated approvals for the accrual of subjects and operation of the project in accordance with your local IRB, Privacy Act, and HIPPA regulations.
D. Solid Tissue Collections: 
(a)Collect a minimum of 50 specimens from lung (1 cm2 epithelial surface area of each specimen), liver (50cm2 surface area of each specimen), and from prostate (lcm2 area of each specimen), using H&E analyses to assure malignant tissue in the paraffin-	embedded and the fresh-frozen tissues, and pancreas (200mg to 500mg per specimen) from patients with cancer or chronic pancreatitis by race and gender as specified by the project officer.,
(b)Provide analytical reports of collection data according to guide-lines provided by the Project Officer.
(c)Classify histo-pathologically both neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues provided to the NCI by routine light microscopy, high resolution light microscopy (1 micron sections), cytochemistry and immunochemistry as specified by the Project Officer
(d)Perform cytochemical and immunohisto-chemical assays for viruses, e.g., HIV and hepatitis B, p53 or cellular or viral proteins, e.g., hepatitis B viral X protein and surface 	antigen, NOS2, COX2, HPR estrogen receptors, keratin, mucus and other such materials on collected and cultured tissues where indicated or as requested by the Project Officer..
E Histopathological Analyses: 
Characterize and classify, histopathologically, both cancerous and non-cancer tissues delivered to the NCI:
a)Provide the diagnosis(ses), the stage, the grade and the INM status from the 	routine pathology reports generated and compiled by the physician and the pathologist of record for individual cases..
b)Using routine light microscopy, high resolution light microscopy (1 micron sections), cytochemistry and immunochemistry perform assays to detect infectious viruses ( e.g., HIV and hepatitis B), p53 or cellular or viral proteins, (e.g.., hepatitis B), viral X protein and surface antigens, NOS2, COX2, GRPR, estrogen receptors, keratin, mucus and other such materials on collected and cultured tissues where indicated or as specified by the Project Officer;
c)When requested and in accordance with SOP's provided by the Project Officer, obtain
(from histology repositories of participating hospitals, and repositories within the research project), section and leave unstained or stain (routine HE or special immunological stains as requested) paraffin embedded tissues from new cases and/or cases previously processed for the project (as specified by investigators via the Project Officer).
F. Software maintenance and modification: 
All electronic or information technology used in this project will be "as is" or slightly modified from modules of the LHC laboratory management system, referred to as LAB MANAGER (aka, LABMGR; LabMgr), the name of an internallexternal, LHC alpha developed, menu driven, password protected, customized system of multiple, networked, and complementary software programs designed and operated to store experimental laboratory research data, including associated laboratory support, maintenance and resource data, for results, analyses and reports management in the research programs in LHC. There are a total of 12 software programs that have been developed, of which 8 systems are complete and functioning; all have assigned or proposed LHC supervisory/ systems accommodating the products produce by the tissue collection contract. The systems or programs that are internal to the contract require the following services:
a)Provide a professionally trained and experienced software developer to redesign, expand,upgrade, train relevant personnel, and maintain in your facilities the three NIH contractor-designed databases (1.Personal profiles and questionnaires database; 2. Tissue collection and transport preparation database; 3.

Background

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) needs to enhance modification to the beta dose calculation algorithm in the computer code VARSKIN 3.0 : A Computer Code for Assessing Skin Dose from Skin Contamination.

The original VARSKIN computer code was initially developed to facilitate skin-dose calculations. This development was under contract to the NRC in 1987 and operated under the DOS operating system.  The source geometries available to the user were preset in the code and were limited to a point and an infinitely thin disk located directly on the skin.  Self-absorption in the source was not considered because the sources had zero volume and the depth of skin at which dose was calculated was programmed into the code at 7 mg cm -2.  

These restrictions limited the use of the code.  Therefore, NRC released an upgraded version of the code, VARSKIN Mod 2 in 1992.  The new version expanded the available source geometries to include cylinders, spheres, and slabs, included calculation of self-absorption in the source, and permitted placement of absorber material between the source and the skin to simulate protective clothing.  The user interface was improved, although the code still operated under DOS.  The revised version also allowed the dose to be averaged over a volume of skin, permitted calculation of dose from multiple rectangular sources, and permitted composite sources that contained several different beta-emitting radionuclides.  The most recent version of the code, VARSKIN 3, added syringe geometry, improved the beta geometry model, and was written to operate in a Windows environment using a graphical interface.  In this version, the calculated skin dose can be averaged over any area that is specified by the use at a user specific depth below the skin surface.  Provision is made to entering the density of a volume source and for specifying multiple layers of protective clothing between the source and the surface of the skin.  The code is used by NRC staff, as well as by licensees and others in nuclear industry, to model and calculate skin dose resulting from hot particles and other forms of skin contamination for regulatory requirements under 10 CFR Part 20.  The code calculates the dose due to beta and photon radiations separately using two independent models.  VARSKIN 3 calculates beta doses using essentially the same method used in VARSKIN Mod 2 by performing a five-dimensional integration of the source volume and target area using the Berger Point-Kernel method. 

The gamma dose model in the current version of VARSKIN uses gamma-ray exposure constants to estimate the dose at the desired depth in tissue, and it will not calculate doses for sources that are larger than 1 mm in size.  It attempts to account for a lack of charged particle equilibrium using a method developed by Lantz and Lambert.  The correction is based on the average energy of the photons emitted by the radionuclide.  This adjustment has not been found to provide an adequate correction, and limitations on the size of the source to 1 mm imposes a fairly serious restriction on the utility of the code to calculate skin doses resulting from photon emissions.  Although photon doses usually contribute a small fraction to the skin dose resulting from skin contamination (especially in the absence of protective clothing), in some situations the
contaminating radionuclide may emit relatively low-energy beta radiation and relatively 
high-energy gamma radiation.  This, coupled with the presence of protective clothing between the contamination and the skin, could lead to a situation in which the gamma dose makes the dominant, if not the only contribution to the skin dose.  

The resulting doses calculated by the code at various photon energies and at various skin depths have been compared with doses calculated by NRC staff using Monte Carlo transport methods, and were found to overestimate the dose with increasing photon energy (up to a factor of five at 1.5 MeV).  The main cause for this lack of accuracy is the inability of the model to adequately allow for lack of charged particle equilibrium at shallow depths at which doses are calculated, normally 7 mg/cm2.

The photon model algorithm currently used in VARSKIN 3 also suffers from serious limitations in its applicability to accurately predict dose from sources other than hot particles.  This includes being restricted to calculating doses from sources that are not larger than 1 mm using the gamma-ray exposure constant as a basis for the dose estimates.  The NRC awarded a contract to Oregon State University in May of 2008 to develop a new sophisticated photon dose algorithm to replace the existing one to address the weaknesses noted above as well to enable the user to reasonably model photon dose for all other source geometries made available in VARSKIN 3.  The algorithm should permit the user to select the depth in the skin at which the dose is to be calculated as well as the area of skin over which the dose is to be averaged. Incorporation of the new algorithm must be performed in a manner that it does not in any way result in changes in beta dose model algorithm of the code.  

In 2008, NRC staff compared the beta and electron doses with the doses for similar geometries calculated using the general purpose radiation transport code MCNP version 5 that was developed and is maintained at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Agreement between the VARSKIN and MCNP results was found to be good in general, but deviated significantly for some contaminant geometries. The reasons were not investigated, but it is believed to be due to the numerical integration methods used to calculate doses from volume sources. The aim of future work on the code is to re-examine these deviations, to determine their cause, and to modify the beta portion of the code to correct the cause. Other modifications to the code may be contemplated, including the possibility of assessing the accuracy of the MCNP calculations of electron doses compared with that for other available transport codes, and the possibility of using other point kernel data besides the Berger data now used in the code, if such data is available.

<DESC>A. General Information.<BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Nasopharyngeal Airway.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DOD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 1 year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Anticipated selection date is April, 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Nasopharyngeal Airway, can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Nasopharyngeal Airway can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR> <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airway, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $209,794.78.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Eileen Lentz, Eileen.lentz@amedd.army.mil  address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Eileen Lentz at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria. <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>  <BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Nasopharyngeal Airway to include at a minimum: sizes 6-9mm ID (8-12mm OD,) or 26-34 French. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage itmes are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR><BR>2.  Products are latex free.<BR><BR>3.  Products are  single use disposable.<BR><BR>4.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Nasopharyngeal Airway product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>5.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR><BR>6.Vendors must submit discounts off  DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO.<BR>     7.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for approximately 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Airway size is easy to identify.<BR>2.	Airway has smooth rounded edges.<BR>3.	Airway facilitates oropharyngeal suctioning.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 1 year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 16 February 2010, 3PM CDT.<BR>

Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO.<BR> <BR>            7. Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide<BR>            contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for approximately 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR> 1. Size of product is easy to identify in packaging.<BR> 2. Product inserts easily into patients airway.<BR> 3. LMA cuff inflates and seals airway.<BR> 4. Product effectively enables airway.<BR> 5. Product removes from patient smoothly.<BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 16 February 2010, 3PM CDT.<BR>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking potential sources to provide an Energy Audit and Waste Stream Analysis per the Scope of Work included below.  Interested parties are requested to provide a written capability statement no later than 5:00 pm Central Time January 28, 2010.The point of contract is Wayne Henthorne Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15, 4101 S. 4th Street Trafficway, Leavenworth, KS 66048.  Fax 913-758-6495, Telephone 913-758-6405, e-mail, wayne.henthorne@va.gov    After potential contractors have been indentified a Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be posted on FedBizOpps with additional information concerning site visit times and locations.  Scope of Work for Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare System Energy Audit and Waste Stream Analysis.The goal of the audit is to provide Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare System (Topeka and Leavenworth Divisions) with a customized, pragmatic and flexible roadmap for sustainability. This roadmap must be a guide that can be used by hospital leaders and staff as a clear path to making facilities and operations more sustainable for many years to come. It must be a practical tool that fits the organization's facilities and operations and flexible enough to change with future needs.  The umbrella of audit services must provide unique and tailored integrated solutions that meet many various needs beyond waste, develop your customized risk and opportunity portfolio, and provide an easy-to-follow roadmap that satisfies requirements of the EPA Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEP) and the Executive Order (EO) 13514. A sustainability audit typically includes the following steps:1.	Hold kickoff meetings. These meetings assemble the internal and external stakeholders from the Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare System. The first goal of the gatherings is to make sure everyone understands the elements of sustainability. Once this is accomplished, the contractor consultant team can set goals for the Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare System audit and establish the areas that have the most priority. Implementation of the SEP and the EO 13514 guidelines is discussed and a compliance strategy will be developed during these meetings. 2.	Complete site investigations. Site investigations identify existing infrastructure system conditions and operational practices. A photographic record is developed to document existing status and procedures. This record will be included with the final report to help validate the findings. During these investigations, all areas of sustainability are looked at so that a comprehensive list of possibilities is developed. In addition, the contractors consultants will work with Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare staff to collect all utility and fleet fuel data for the previous 2 years per EO 13514 to create a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions baseline. 3.	Identify areas of impact. These are areas within the Eastern Kansas VA facilities or operations that are currently unsustainable. They are ranked in order of significance to indicate the effect of each item on core sustainability. A complete description of impact areas is then developed. These areas will be well-described and well-documented so a consultant team can understand and direct the outcome of the audit. 4.	Develop recommendations. Recommendations are developed once a comprehensive analysis of the facilities and operations is complete. Recommendations are made for each impact area, which include a description of the facility system or operational practice in its ideal form. All recommendations are driven by the impetuous to reduce GHG emissions and reach target utility reductions and waste diversions per the EO 13514 and the EPA SEP.  An estimated cost for the improvement, any applicable estimates of energy, water, and waste diversion savings, and other resulting benefits are included in each recommendation. 5.	Develop the final sustainability plan. After the areas of impact and final recommendations are fully considered by the Consultant team, a sustainability plan is developed. The plan will indicate sustainable actions already in place at the facilities. It will also include changes to the facility or operations planned, along with an estimated timeline for incorporation of each element. The sustainability plan must make recommendations for an education program to detail to all staff how they can bring sustainability to their jobs and how daily actions can make a significant environmental difference. 6.	Measurement and verification tool. The contractor will assist the Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare system track and measure improvements to the facilities through a business intelligence software tool. The web-based tool allows facilities managers and staff to upload, track, and manage sustainability data, such as energy and water usage and subsequent reductions, waste diversion, chemical and pharmaceutical disposal, and GHG inventory. This data management tool gives the Eastern Kansas VA the power to understand its resource management and create a long-term fiscally sound strategy. 7.	Implementation. Contractor will provide the Eastern Kansas VA Healthcare System an integrated waste solution that handles the transportation and disposal of medical, hazardous, solid waste, and recyclable materials post waste audit. Items that are acceptable for diversion from the main waste stream will be cataloged in the waste audit, and the costs associated with the transportation and disposal will be provided by contractor. Contractor will provide recycling solutions for various types of medical waste such as surgical blue wrap and atypical plastics. The solid waste diversion and EPA standards disposal of chemical and pharmaceutical waste is integral to the compliance of the EPA SEP and the EO 13514. This audit can include many areas of focus. The categories and strategies indicated here follow the widely accepted Guiding Principles for Sustainable Buildings standards that are currently in use. CategoryGreenhouse Gas Emissions Baseline	Strategies May Include: 	Interview facilities managers and staff to determine all GHG emissions sources	Quantify GHG emissions through a systematic review of utility billing and fleet mileage. 	Calculate GHG footprint according to collected data from interviews, billing, and waste, energy, and water audits	Maintain documentation of GHG baseline in accordance to the GHG Protocol through the World Resources Institute and the EPA. Sites		Storm water removal should be focused to minimize runoff, erosion and pollutants leaving the site. 	Maintenance and operations vehicles should be reviewed for possible change to low-emitting vehicles, and GHG emissions from current fleet will be cataloged. 	Parking and possible charging stations for low-emitting vehicles should be considered. 	Heat islands and light pollution should be minimized or eliminated. 	Respite areas should be maximized to improve the patient experience and patient connection to the outdoors. Water efficiency	Consider alternatives for "pump-and-dump" water-cooled condensers and potable water bypass to cooling coils. 	Consider alternatives to medical air compressors and medical vacuum systems that use water seals. 	Replace landscaping that uses significant irrigation water. 	Consider rainwater harvesting for internal and irrigation uses. Energy and atmosphere	Investigate current lighting systems and make recommendations for energy saving alternatives	Consider higher-efficiency alternatives to the central plant heating and cooling equipment. 	Investigate fuel cells and microturbines for normal power cogeneration. 	Complete recommissioning of systems to validate performance. 	Add measurement and verification of systems to ongoing maintenance checklists. Material resources	Eliminate all remaining mercury and lead. 	Reduce volatile organic compounds and persistentbioaccumulative toxic substances. 	Begin an aggressive recycling campaign. 	Reduce waste stream products as much as possible. 	Track and verify proper disposal of pharmaceutical and chemical wasteEnvironmental quality		Verify proper ventilation in all areas. 	Provide maximum patient control of the patient room environment. 	Verify that exhaust air quantities are being maintained from labs and other pollutant-generating hospital areas. 	Maximize patient connection with daylight and the outdoors. 	Minimize noise and interruptions in normal background sounds. 	Ensure that construction areas have a minimal impact on indoor environmental quality. Operations	Continually measure to validate that sustainable improvements have the desired effect. 	Review the waste stream for potential volume reductions. 	Increase the use of sustainable cleaning product and materials. 	Make sure purchasing policies and supply chain management support sustainable goals	Eliminate harmful chemical compounds where possible. 	Reduce paper waste.

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />
<p><br />DLT Solutions has been identified by the manufacturer of these software products as the sole government reseller. Autodesk Architectural Desktop, Raster Design, and Map 3D software have already been tested and certified to work in the ISP environment, and they are the only SOCOM-approved architectural software applications that fall under the ISP Programs Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP). The software is currently installed and in use at USSCOM. To solicit for another software source at this point would result in delays and users unable to meet mission requirements. Furthermore, the users are already trained on how to use Autodesk software. At this time, it is not economically feasible to evaluate other software brands, or to alter the current system configuration. This would only duplicate the research and integration that was already accomplished. Cost to replace this software with another brand is not expected to be recovered through competition. Replacement cost is estimated at $23,472.60 (or higher), which would be an increase of 57% or more.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with Fortune a division of Time, Inc, New York, New York on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a single source, to procure a full-page display advertisement in the March 22, 2010 issue of Fortune Magazine.  
Sole Source Justification - In the March 22, 2010 issue of Fortune Magazine, a special advertising section highlighting economic opportunities in Maryland is planned. Several NIST researchers are main contributors to the text portion of the Fortune Magazine supplement.  Many other organizations based in Maryland, such as other federal facilities and universities, will be featured in the supplement text as well. The supplement is a special feature of this particular issue of Fortune and will not appear in any other business magazines. Therefore, Fortune is the sole source available for this service.  NIST plans to purchase with a firm fixed price purchase order, a full page advertisement to appear within the pages of the Fortune magazine supplement.  The advertisement will highlight NIST's presence in Maryland and is designed to inform technology-oriented businesses about NIST's facilities and cooperative research opportunities.  
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
BACKGROUND:  Onset Computer Corporation manufactures the data loggers that SWAN has been using to continuously monitor temperature and light intensity in SWAN lakes.  These devices are used in the construction of temperature arrays, which are deployed year-round in lakes of high management concern.  In 2010 we will deploy 3 additional temperature arrays.  To remain consistent with data collection standard operating procedures, it is important to continue using the same brand of temperature and light sensor.														1)	FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   		Onset Computer Corporation470 MacArthur Blvd 			Bourne, MA  025321.800.564.4377
2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: These temperature and light intensity data loggers are compact, programmable devices that can be deployed to collect continuous data under a wide temperature range and can be deployed to a depth of 120 m.  These rugged devices require minimal effort to operate providing unattended data collection from a suite of lakes within SWAN.Costs:Water Temp Pro v1 logger - $110.00/unit (for purchases of more than 10 units)HOBO Temperature/ Light Pendant Data Logger - $51.00/unit (for purchases of more than 10 units)Waterproof shuttle - $230.00 - portable shuttle for downloading data remotely. 
Onset Computer Corporation processes orders quickly and reliably and provides excellent customer service.  Online orders are processed and received within 2 weeks.
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  SWAN has been using Onset HOBO data loggers for 4 years.  We have invested in the software and communication devices required to operate these data loggers, and invested significant time developing SOPs for operating these data loggers.  Therefore, the most cost-effective option is to continue with Onset data loggers.  While other manufacturers exist, the device specifications differ and would require additional software and communication investments as well as additional field time to collect comparative data from devices of different manufacturers.   These data logger designs do not met the needs of the SWAN program for efficient data collection across a wide range of environmental factors.
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Onset Computer Corporation manufactures the industry standard in waterproof data loggers.  They provide a variety of models economically priced to meet environmental research and monitoring needs and are widely used throughout the NPS for monitoring.  While other types of data loggers exist - they do not meet the requirements for deployment under a wide range of environmental conditions.
5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: SWAN has purchased Onset data loggers annually for the 4 years using micro-purchase authority.  Prior purchases remained within the micro-purchase authority as SWAN expanded lake monitoring incrementally.  In 2010, lake monitoring will expand significantly requiring a larger equipment inventory to carry out the planned monitoring.
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  To date, no known competitors exist for data loggers that meet our specifications.

B.1	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
	Accelerating Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II) 
	See Section C for a complete description.


The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery and organization to measurably improve health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will focus on practice-based research to achieve the following 4 objectives:

	Implementation of a proof of concept, through which a previously untested innovation is tested on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified problem (OR: to determine whether it works to solve/address an identified problem);

	Implementation of an innovation or improvement approach*, to provide information for decision-makers about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation will actually work in a given setting;

	Spread, or the taking to scale, of one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements, including the active, wide dissemination of information about what works, accompanied by concrete guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability.  Increasing knowledge about strategies used to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is an important ACTION objective as well. 

	Sustainability, to increase knowledge about the factors that contribute to, or impede, the long term sustainability of innovation.  In particular, we will look to ACTION II to closely examine the experiences and outcomes of ACTION projects that were implemented 3 or more years ago, with a focus on measuring whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained and enhancing understanding of the factors that supported or impeded sustainability.


B.2	TASK ORDERS

	This is a task order requirement for Changes and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION II). Services will be acquired on an as-needed basis through issuance of task orders. The minimum total amount to be awarded over the three year base period is plus two (2) year Option Period will be $3,750,000.00. It is anticipated that the maximum total amount for the Base period will be $4,500,000.00 and 3,000,000.00 for the Option Periods. Typical task orders are expected to range between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background

AHRQs mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  Agency funding is growing for research that advances the implementation and dissemination of promising or proven innovations that address the most pressing concerns of those who deliver, manage, pay for, or receive health care services.  AHRQs role in supporting efforts to improve real-world practice and policy has expanded rapidly, in part as a result of the recent emergence of health care reform as one of the most pressing challenges the nation faces.

In 2004, Greenhalgh et al.  completed an extensive review of literature addressing the question how can we spread and sustain innovations in health service delivery and organization? These authors identified several knowledge gaps on which to focus further research, and suggested that the most serious gap must be addressed by answering the question: By what processes are particular innovations implemented and sustained (or not) in particular contexts and settings, and can these processes be enhanced? In 2006, AHRQ launched an initiative titled Accelerating Change and Transformation in Organizations and Networks (ACTION) that attempted to address many aspects of the gap identified by Greenhalgh et al., and that is the precursor of the current procurement, ACTION II.

ACTION is a five-year task order contract model of practice-based implementation research that includes 15 Partnerships that work under task order contracts.  The Partnerships include a total of over 140 additional collaborating organizations. In total, ACTION Partnerships provide care to more than 100 million people nationwide that represent a broad geographic, demographic and payer mix.  The 15 Partnerships reach across all states and are composed of diverse organizations involved in health care, including: hospital systems; ambulatory care practices; long-term care systems (nursing homes, home health, assisted living); safety net systems; health plans; university schools of medicine, nursing, public health, health policy, and management; health services and outcomes research organizations; Veterans Integrated Delivery System Networks; health care quality assurance organizations, associations of healthcare providers; and consumer advocacy organizations.  Each Partnership contains operational systems that house large, robust, healthcare databases, clinical and research expertise, and the authority to implement health care innovations. A particular focus of ACTION task orders has been on increasing understanding not only of whether a particular innovation works, but on how and why it does or does not work. ACTION represents one of the Agencys most successful efforts to foster public-private collaboration and incorporate best practices into health care delivery, broadly defined (see Definitions below). The period of performance for the current ACTION initiative ends September 30, 2010. For more information about ACTION, including descriptions and funding levels for task orders funded to date, go to www.ahrq.gov/research/ACTION.htm.  

Since ACTION was launched in 2006, calls for additional practice-based research endeavors have increased, and the value of this type of research has been more widely recognized (Shortell et. al, JAMA 2007, Berwick JAMA 2008, Wachter ). Berwick highlighted the need for research methodologies that focus on the local details about how something works and about the what of contexts, rather than removing these details in theoretical pursuit of generalizable knowledge. Berwick noted that it is only by retaining and sharing information about both the mechanisms  and contexts (local conditions that could have influenced the outcomes of interest), that one develops an understanding of the factors that affect generalizability.   Shortell and his colleagues similarly identified the need for increased knowledge about how to put known improvements into routine practice as a key component for improving the quality of care.  Shortell et. al. noted that this integration of content and context seldom happens, and specifically called for the expansion of practice-based research networks such as AHRQs ACTION.   Furthermore, Harvards Steven Spear offered the following guidance and insights from his study of Toyota:  When experimenting with innovations, do not merely ask "what did we accomplish?'" but "what did we learn and how can we put that learning to good use?   Spear has noted that
 
(i)f you manage your work to achieve constant discoverydoing your work with a close eye toward what you don't understand, seeing problems as they occur, solving those problems, converting what you don't understand into something that you do understand, and then putting to use what you now understand and what others don't understandyou could improve and invent more quickly, for longer, and in more areas than anyone else. The key is not importing the answer: it's in importing the robust process by which the great answers are discovered.  
 
Particular interest in research on delivery of care improvement (e.g. process redesign, organizational changes, or financial incentives) has increased since efforts to launch health care reform began in earnest in early 2009.  Nearly one quarter of the priority topics specified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in Initial National Priorities for Comparative Effectiveness Research (http://www.iom.edu/?ID=71025) as meriting more attention are classified in the IOMs broad health care delivery system (HCDS) research area.  This type of research is, of course, particularly well-suited to the interests and capabilities of past and future ACTION researchers.

The current procurement for ACTION II seeks to answer these calls. ACTION II is open to all offerors and will establish an entirely new set of task order contracts. For ACTION II, AHRQ anticipates making awards to between 12 and 15 ACTION II Partnerships that are expected to have many similar characteristics to ACTION Partnerships.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, similarities in task order characteristics are likely to apply as well. There is a high probability of steady or increasing funding for task orders from AHRQ portfolios. In addition, funding may be provided from external sponsors.  Organizations that have funded past task orders include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the DHHS Office of Minority Health/Office of the Secretary, the National Cancer Institute, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  For ACTION II, AHRQ is taking steps to better meet the needs of users, stakeholders and Agency and DHHS goals,  to improve work flow and productivity and to support enhanced communication and collaboration within and among the Partnerships.

Definitions and Frequently Asked Questions

For the purposes of this RFP, the following definitions, some of which have been adapted from Greenhalgh et al., apply: 

Innovation in health care delivery, organization, payment and practice (referred to hereafter as health care delivery): a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness, access to care or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Innovations can either be new to the field of health care delivery or new to a given organization or particular type of setting.

Implementation: active and planned efforts to mainstream an innovation within an organization

Dissemination: active and planned efforts to persuade target groups to adopt an innovation

Sustainability: making an innovation routine until it reaches obsolescence

AHRQ priority populations: children, the elderly, women, individuals affected by low income, who belong to racial/ethnic minorities, who live in rural areas, who are disabled or have special needs

AHRQ target audiences: clinical, health care provider, purchaser/business, policy, and consumer/patient decision-makers

Appendix 1 includes a series of frequently asked questions, based on prior RFPs for implementation research.
 
Objectives

The goal of ACTION II is to promote and accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based innovation in health care delivery to measurably improve the effectiveness, safety, quality and efficiency of health care in the U.S.  In support of this goal, ACTION II will support practice-based research focused on achieving one or more of the following four objectives:
 
	Test or expand investigation of innovations that are new to the health care field, (proofs of concept). Research focused on this objective involves: testing a previously untested innovation on a small scale to demonstrate its feasibility for addressing an identified health care problem; documenting whether and how well it did or did not work, and why; spreading knowledge generated by this research to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Implement, in additional settings, interventions or improvement approaches that have been demonstrated to have worked in a limited type or number of settings. Research aimed at achieving this objective would generate findings about structural, contextual and process factors that play a critical role in increasing (or reducing) the chances that a proven, evidence-based innovation actually works in various settings; and spreading findings to appropriate decision-makers and other audiences.

	Spread, or take to scale, one or more proven innovations or delivery system improvements.  Activities to achieve this objective would include the active, wide dissemination of one or more innovations that have proven successful in improving health outcomes or on-the-ground care delivery and the provision of guidance on how to maximize the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability of the innovation/s. Identifying and evaluating different strategies for promoting the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice by providers and other decision-makers is another important component of this objective. Activities to increase spread can take many forms, and can be undertaken by and/or target any key stakeholder groups.   

	Support Sustainability. To achieve this objective, researchers shall: identify and study the factors that contribute to, or impede, the routinization of innovation by appropriate decision-makers and other audiences. In particular, AHRQ will look to ACTION II to closely examine past ACTION (and other) projects to assess whether and to what degree positive outcomes were sustained, and to learn more about their longer term experiences in trying to sustain their innovations.


ACTION II Characteristics

ACTION II will embody some similar and some new features when compared with ACTION. The principal features of ACTION II include: 

Task Order Master Contract Mechanism: Each ACTION II awardee shall hold a 3-year task order master contract with a 2-year option to extend the contract. Competitive (or justified sole-source) solicitations for task orders will be sent by email to these pre-competed prime contractors throughout each fiscal year.  Each prime contractor shall share these requests for task order (RFTO) with others in its Partnership and decide whether or not to submit one or more task order proposals in response to the RFTO. AHRQ will specify the number of awards anticipated in response to a single RFTO, and the range or ceiling on the cost estimate for each award. Generally, proposals must be submitted within four to eight weeks.  The proposals submitted in response to each RFTO will be reviewed on average within two to three weeks by a committee of approximately five expert reviewers selected among AHRQ staff, co-funders (where applicable), and external experts in the areas critical to the success of the task order. Revisions may be required of one or more top scoring proposals for each anticipated award. Awards will generally be made within two to three weeks of receipt of best and final proposals. 

Topics for Research:  ACTION II is intended to generate and spread knowledge about solutions to current problems in a timely way. ACTION II will thus focus on practical, applied topics of high interest to: the DHHS and AHRQs portfolios (see Appendix 2), the Partners own operational leaders and champions, others making critical decisions and managing change, and other users/stakeholders.  AHRQ intends to use various mechanisms (e.g., Requests for Information, email queries, input from the ACTION II Steering Committee, input from an AHRQ web call for ACTION II concepts) to solicit user input on task order topics and ensure they are feasible, of high priority and ready for implementation or dissemination.  

Broadly speaking, topics will likely include, but will not be limited to: patient safety, health information technology, the structure, organization and coordination of care; payment; quality of care; comparative effectiveness of systems design and change strategies; health care for priority populations; prevention and care management, long-term care, health literacy and emergency preparedness. No health care setting, type of provider, type of recipient, payer or health condition will be excluded from consideration with respect to research topics that may be undertaken under ACTION II, though individual RFTOs are likely to focus on particular types of settings, providers or patients. It is expected that there will be a wide array of topics with substantial diversity within a given topic area. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics that are unknown at the launch of ACTION II may emerge over time. As was noted earlier, task orders will have a particular focus on research designed to increase knowledge about contextual factors that may facilitate or impede implementation, spread and sustainability. 

Nature of the Research: Practice-based research on the development, testing, implementation, spread and sustainability of innovations can take many forms. Some task orders will support the development or preliminary testing (proof-of concept) of package deliverables (e.g., toolkits, curricula, workbooks, guides, models, practice strategies) that address a problem in a new or novel way.  Other task orders may call for the implementation of a proven innovation in sites similar to, and/or different from, those in which it was developed, with the goal of increasing knowledge about the process of implementing innovations and the contextual factors influencing implementation. Still other task orders may focus on the evaluation of different strategies for spreading a proven intervention widely, in order to identify those that are most effective in increasing the systematic and successful adoption and utilization of evidence-based practices. Finally, an additional set of task orders may focus on evaluating whether and to what degree innovations implemented under past ACTION contracts (or other AHRQ initiatives) were sustained, and increasing knowledge about the factors that support or impede sustainability.

Types of Innovations:   As previously defined, innovations are a novel set of behaviors, routines, and ways of working that are directed at improving health outcomes, administrative efficiency, cost effectiveness or users experience and that are implemented by planned and coordinated actions. Examples of current health care delivery innovations include evidence-based improvement strategies or activities such as Lean, positive deviance, social network analysis, and the implementation of bundled interventions (e.g. Pronovosts Keystone ICU bundle to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections ), bundled payments (e.g. around the Patient Centered Medical Home ) or other innovative financial mechanisms . Future innovations will emerge over the course of the ACTION II period of performance.

ACTION II innovations may be local to national in scope. Some past innovations have spread internationally, although this will not be explicitly envisioned or intended in the development of ACTION II RFTOs. AHRQ will make efforts to select and emphasize project work that is broadly responsive to existing user and stakeholder needs and operational interests, and that has the potential for future dissemination to additional health care settings, providers. payors or recipients of care. While a minority of task orders are expected to focus on large (regional, national) implementation or dissemination projects, Partnerships that have the capacity to take innovations to scale, either on their own or in partnership with others, to spread an innovation will be of special interest to AHRQ. 

Deliverables:  AHRQ and others experience has shown that delivery of a product or package alone to an intended audience is generally insufficient to induce tangible change in care delivery. Those delivering and receiving care often need help in using a new product or approach, particularly if behavior change is required to improve care. ACTION II will thus seek to generate deliverables that maximize the likelihood that research findings and best practices can and will be appropriately utilized by the intended audience/s. Final deliverables may include, but would not be limited to:
	products (e.g. toolkits, workbooks or guides) that provide detailed, practical descriptions of an innovation, explanations of how it is supposed to work and advice for implementing it
	innovative educational or training materials, including curricula for educational/training sessions or workshops (these may be web based)
	provision of support and technical assistance in the adaptation and adoption of a package or process by various new users 
	research findings written for decision-makers
	peer-reviewed and trade journal manuscripts, or final reports suitable for web-posting, summarizing lessons learned

Every deliverable, regardless of its form or content, must be specifically developed for or adapted to the intended audience/s.

Task orders may require the provision of a series of interim deliverables to accelerate delivery of critical findings or better document implementation processes as they unfold. Interim deliverables might include the completion of an environmental scan, the convening of focus groups, technical expert panels or stakeholder meetings, and the development or testing of measures or data bases, interim reports, surveys, or case studies, to name just a few. 

Dissemination: Spreading knowledge generated under task orders is a key component of all four objectives for ACTION II. ACTION II Partnerships may opt to include that capability within their proposed Partnership (by including as members one or more organizations with expertise in dissemination/knowledge transfer), or to subcontract for that expertise on a case-by-case basis, as dictated by the needs or requirements of a specific RFTO. Such expertise should include editing and technical writing, at a minimum.  In addition, AHRQ technical assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing may also be provided (see Appendix 3).   

Rapid Cycle Research: Individual ACTION II task orders must be completed within as short a time frame as feasible. As a frame of reference, ACTION task orders have been completed within 20 months, on average, of the award date. AHRQ expects ACTION II task orders to meet this average timeline of performance.  Exceptions to accelerated task orders may include task orders that require an additional 7-9 months (on average, currently) to meet OMB clearance requirements, and/or task orders that are very large, multifaceted, and require longer periods of data collection.  In AHRQs experience, several factors help accelerate the turn-around time of task orders once awarded.  These factors include, but are not limited to: a focus on topics for which there is a clearly expressed need by a specific intended audience, that are of high current interest to the Partnerships themselves, and for which there is alignment of interest of all parties involved in making the innovation successful; active involvement of champions and operational leaders; and inclusion of individuals in the Partnership who are knowledgeable about, and can readily access and manipulate, needed health care delivery and organizational data.

Sequenced and Bundled Work:  AHRQ may, where appropriate, reduce the current focus on individual task orders and increase the emphasis on a series of task orders or bundled sets of task orders to permit pursuit of topics to their logical and practical ends and take applications to scale. Some of the work to be done under ACTION II will likely be sequenced, with the work of each new phase being dependent on the results of a previous phase. In other cases, a set (bundle) of task orders may be awarded in response to a single RFTO on a topic. It is to be expected that some mix of individual and bundled/serial task orders will be awarded in each year. 

Freedom to Partner with Diverse Organizations or Stakeholder Groups on an As Needed Basis.  Partnerships will be allowed to subcontract with other organizations, as necessary, to meet the needs of a given RFTO.  Partners shall have to decide at the outset which capacities they are likely to need on a continuing basis, and which they may prefer to seek and obtain on a case by case basis to enable them to compete for, and successfully complete, specific task orders throughout the contractual timeline. 

Opportunities for Broad-based Collaboration:  AHRQ expects to encourage more intersections among the ACTION II Partnerships. For example awardees of bundled task orders may wish, or be expected, to share lessons learned with each other as the task orders progress. Depending on the nature of specific task orders, ACTION II Partners many also be encouraged or required to interact with other AHRQ initiatives and programs such as the Health Care Innovations Exchange, the Primary-care Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs), or the HIV Research Network. More information on these and other programs is available at www.ahrq.gov.

Emphasis on Communication and Knowledge Capture: A number of mechanisms will be utilized to support and ensure regular communication between AHRQ and its ACTION II Partners, and among the ACTION II members-- both within and across Partnerships. These will include electronic transmission of progress reports, phone calls, virtual and face-to-face meetings, and the use of a new ACTION II portal. More specifically: 

	ACTION II task order contractors shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQs electronic reporting system. In addition, contractors and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. 

	ACTION II members shall communicate with each other, both within and across Partnerships, through an ACTION II web portal (see Appendix 3) that will be created for this purpose. Tools to support dialogue and collaboration will include web conferencing, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will also serve as an additional avenue for communication between task order officers or ACTION II staff, and contractors. For example, ACTION II staff might use it for teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

	ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository that will be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 

	Representatives of all ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in annual (or perhaps semi annual) face-to-face or virtual meetings. Other meeting participants may include ACTION II Staff, AHRQ Task Order Officers, the AHRQ Contracting Officer, experts in federal requirements, and experts in dissemination. ACTION II members will be expected to help AHRQ staff and ACTION II Steering Committee members shape the agenda for these meetings to assure their relevance to participants needs. Meeting topics may include sharing insights and lessons learned about ACTION II work, new opportunities for collaboration, or strategies developed to meet contractual requirements or overcome common obstacles. 

External Steering Committee: AHRQ expects to convene an External Steering Committee of leading operationally-based experts in healthcare delivery and other stakeholders and champions (including some already involved in advising AHRQ on related topics) to provide direction for ACTION II.  Guidance from the Steering Committee on how best to achieve program goals is intended to supplement that provided by AHRQ Center and Office Directors, portfolio leads and Task Order Officers, and will focus on identifying the most promising opportunities for the program and providing continuous input on strategic planning. The Steering Committee will also serve as an effector arm to help disseminate and promote uptake of ACTION II innovations.
 

Meeting Federal Requirements:  Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. As is further discussed below and in Appendix 3, AHRQ will help ACTION II Partners access technical assistance and other resources to support these efforts.

Support and Technical Assistance for ACTION II Partnerships: AHRQ seeks to help contractors more quickly and efficiently meet specific federal requirements for ACTION II task orders and deliverables (e.g. obtain OMB clearance, meet Section 508 compliance and other web-based product requirements) and enhance dissemination, communication and marketing efforts (see Appendix 3). To this end, AHRQ has arranged to provide support and technical assistance in the above-specified areas to Partnerships, as needed, on a case by case basis for awarded task orders. It is anticipated that some Partnerships already may have some or all required expertise within the project team they propose in response to an RFTO and may not require additional support or technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. Whether the expertise is subcontracted through AHRQ-organized experts or supplied by the team itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs. 

Eligibility Criteria

AHRQ encourages submission of proposals from Partnerships that will represent, in total, expertise that spans a broad array of organizations involved in health care delivery and recipients of care (including AHRQs priority populations). These include, but are not limited to health services research organizations; health care delivery systems and organizations (inpatient, ambulatory and long-term care); health plans; academic health centers, research consulting firms; Quality Improvement Organizations; Veterans Administration sites and other governmental organizations; employers or employer coalitions; state and local government health care agencies; community-based collaboratives to improve health care, consumer advocacy groups, and other organizations that work at the national, state or regional level to promote or leverage evidence-based innovation in health care delivery.  Given trends in recent funding and priority topics, AHRQ is particularly interested in Partnerships that center on, or include, substantial numbers of primary care providers interested in participating in ACTION II implementation research. It is important to note that the range of settings/providers included in any specific partnership will not be a scoring criteria; AHRQ hopes to achieve overall diversity across the network of partnerships selected for awards.   

There are no restrictions or requirements regarding the number or types of organizations that should be included in a Partnership, and there are many different models that Partnerships may consider in configuring themselves, including but not limited to the following examples:
	A Partnership may wish to focus on a particular type of provider/care setting/access organization. An example might be a Partnership of primary care practice-based research networks (PBRNS). Other examples might includes hospital systems, long-term care facilities, safety net delivery systems, or health plans that the Partnership would enlist to represent a diverse group of that type of organization; 
	A Partnership may wish to enlist participation from a broad group of stakeholders who span the full range of settings within which care is delivered to a specific priority population (e.g., children, the elderly, the underserved);
	A Partnership may wish to focus on achieving change through a particular type of innovation (e.g., payment) and enlist the participation of interested providers, health plans, and public and private payers 
	A Partnership may be a multi-stakeholder collaborative, composed of plans, providers, payer and consumers from a given geographic region
	A Partnership may be composed of safety net providers who serve multiple priority populations 

The Partnerships proposal must describe how specific characteristics of each participating member organization shall contribute to meeting ACTION IIs objectives.
 
NOTE: The lead, or prime, offeror in a Partnership submitting a proposal may be a not-for-profit or for-profit organization. While primes cannot be included in any other submission, non-prime collaborators may be included in more than one Partnership.  

ACTION II Performance Requirements

To successfully complete task orders that achieve the goals and objectives of the ACTION II program, ACTION II Partnerships must meet the following requirements: 

Requirement #1:  Understand and conform to the requirements of the Task Order Master Contract Mechanism. ACTION II Partnerships must be familiar with federal task order contract mechanisms and must be prepared to adhere to the requirements of the master contract signed by the lead Partner. While this point seems obvious, past experience has shown some misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of the signed task order contract by the lead contractor organization or the subcontractors on a given task order.  Task order contracts differ substantially from grants. For example: task orders must conform strictly to the scope of work for which the task order is awarded unless a modification is agreed to in advance by appropriate AHRQ staff; deliverables must be submitted on time and their quality must be approved by AHRQ staff;  deliverables must be approved by AHRQ staff prior to publication or presentation; invoices for hours worked during the invoice period must be submitted regularly and must include all required details; payment is conditional on submission of invoices and task order officer approval of the quality of the work performed; work conducted past the end date of the task order period of performance will not be reimbursed; and OMB clearance is required for collection of certain types and amounts of data. Partnerships that can demonstrate a track record of successful task order contract work, and/or have a clear understanding of, and willingness to conform to, contractual requirements will be preferred.  

Requirement # 2:  Understand and be committed to the benefits and purposes of practice-based implementation research generally, and of ACTION goals and objectives more specifically. ACTION II Partnerships must have a keen awareness of where their research might, and should, be applied in practice.  As has already been noted, but bears repeating, AHRQ is particularly interested in process: how implementation and dissemination of innovations works (or why it does not work). In cases where real-time learning is occurring, it will be important to capture sufficient information on the process itself to allow other health care delivery systems, organizations, and practitioners to adapt (or avoid) the innovation for their own use.  There must be sufficient scrutiny and documentation of processes to assure that others can gain from the experience of the task order team.

In preparing proposals in response to RFTOs, Partners should address questions such as:  
a.	Who are the end users who will apply the innovation in practice?
b.	What barriers or obstacles need to be addressed and overcome? What facilitators can be engaged? 
c.	Which implementation partners can help involve the most appropriate users? 
d.	Which dissemination partners can help reach additional appropriate users? 
e.	How can the research outcomes best be communicated to the intended audiences? 
f.	What is the best way to evaluate how the innovation works and if it will be sustainable? 

Requirement #3: Enlist the committed, continuing participation of organizations whose missions and capacities enable them to successfully complete task orders serving one or more of the four ACTION objectives for practice-based research (see Objectives).

AHRQ seeks involvement of: diverse providers and provider and system sites; providers of all levels of care that serve underserved populations; public and private payers interested in working with providers to achieve large scale and sustained innovation; organizations representing consumers/recipients of care; organizations with large data bases; researchers with clinical, organizational, measurement and other interests and expertise in health care delivery. Since the goal of ACTION II is to accelerate the development, implementation and sustainability of evidence-based innovations to improve health delivery, AHRQ has an obvious interest in including providers who have a track record of being innovators, early adopters, change agents or otherwise at the cutting edge of developing or implementing innovation. However, AHRQ believes that it is equally important that ACTION II include organizations that are broadly representative of the full spectrum of providers in terms of their past experience with implementing innovation or their capacity to do so.

Requirement #4:  Perform high quality, practice-based implementation research. Partnerships will be expected to demonstrate research capacity and experience with all facets of practice-based implementation research, as described above.  Such research shall of necessity center on a broad range of health care settings, providers, recipients of care, payers, and possibly on particular health conditions and will be expected to span diverse demographic, payer and geographic mixes. Multi-method research will often, if not always, be required. This will in turn require collaborations among well-recognized researchers, clinicians and others with expertise and experience in the full range of implementation research methods ( including both qualitative and quantitative methods); in manipulating large, robust databases (particularly electronic databases); in evidence-based management; and in a wide range of substantive clinical and organizational/management issue areas.  Finally, an ability to properly perform the desired research will require access to data bases whose size, scope and specificity are well-aligned with the research questions they are expected to help answer.

Requirement #5: Be prepared to enlist the participation of additional organizations in response to emergent needs and opportunities. Because the period of performance is three years with a two-year option to extend, important topics and opportunities may emerge over time. Thus, Partnerships must be able to flexibly respond to new and unanticipated topics and opportunities. This flexibility is likely to result from a combination of the existing capacities of the Partnership and its member organizations, as well as from an ability to nimbly expand and change over time to accommodate new challenges and opportunities as they arise. As was noted earlier, AHRQ also expects to encourage more intersections with other initiatives and programs within or external to AHRQ.

Requirement #6: Perform research that supports AHRQs research priorities as reflected in its portfolios. Generally, funding for ACTION II task orders will come from one or more of AHRQs portfolios. The subjects of these task orders will thus reflect the research interests and objectives of the portfolios (see Appendix 2). The composition and capacities of ACTION II Partnerships should be shaped by a desire to serve these interests and objectives. 

Requirement #7:  Target priority populations. AHRQ seeks to include ACTION II Partnerships that serve large numbers of one or more priority populations (see Definitions). Because of the importance of this requirement, offerors are required to complete a matrix that provides information on the characteristics of the Partnerships recipients of care (Appendix 4.

Requirement #8: Engage and involve operational and quality improvement leaders.  AHRQ will expect to see evidence of strong commitment from operational and quality improvement leaders and champions of innovation, learning and change within ACTION IIs Partnerships.  Champions and leaders are expected to actively support healthcare delivery and organization improvement (e.g., making efforts to encourage the adoption of best practices, where promising, within and beyond their organizations). 

Requirement #9: Understand and meet the needs of AHRQ target audiences. Understanding and serving the needs of AHRQs multiple target audiences (see Definitions) is a central requirement of ACTION II. While no single Partnership is expected to represent or include every one of these audiences, AHRQ intends to ensure that all of these audiences will be well represented within the ACTION II network. Offerors will thus be asked to provide information on the basic characteristics of their Partnerships participants and any additional audiences the Partnership is in a position to reach and influence (Appendices 4 and 5). 

Requirement #10:  Identify and utilize communications and dissemination vehicles, methods and mechanisms that will maximize the likelihood of broad and meaningful translation of research into practice.  Dissemination of findings or products will be a key requirement of every ACTION II RFTO. Partnerships will have the option of demonstrating expertise and experience within their teams of what is variously referred to as knowledge transfer and exchange, knowledge communication, knowledge translation. Alternatively, Partnerships may wish to subcontract out the dissemination/knowledge translation functions on a case by case basis for individual task orders.  For some task order deliverables considered to be particularly important, additional assistance with dissemination, communication and marketing will be provided by AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (see Appendix 3).   

Requirement #11:  Manage complex research projects and coordinate widely varying activities across multiple, diverse sites and actors. Each Partnership will be required to designate a point person or small team located within the lead Partner organization to assume responsibility for: meeting ACTION II contract requirements (including the federal requirements described above); coordinating tasks and activities within the Partnership; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff throughout the period of performance of the ACTION II master contract. This point of contact or team will be expected to develop and maintain a solid working relationship with AHRQ staff affiliated with ACTION II (Task Order Officers, Contracting Officer, Program Officer, Support and Technical Assistance staff, if needed) and shall be responsible for maintaining current information on Partnership activities, participants and task order progress and deliverables on the ACTION II portal. Every technical proposal submitted in response to an RFTO must include information on who shall perform this role and how these needs shall be met; cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours and costs. 

Requirement #12: Comply with federal requirements. As noted above, completion of task orders shall generally require compliance with one or more federal laws or regulations, such as those associated with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects. In addition, all deliverables must adhere to AHRQ publishing guidelines. As detailed in Requirement #11, an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization must ensure that all federal requirements are met and coordinate all activities associated with doing so.

Requirement #13:  Work on an accelerated basis. Partnerships must have the organizational expertise, experience and willingness to conduct and complete task orders within as short a time frame as feasible. As was noted above, on average task orders not requiring OMB clearance will have periods of performance of approximately 20 months (range: 18-30 months). 

Requirement #14:  Meet deadlines: ACTION II contractors shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables. For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

Requirement #15:  Engage in knowledge sharing activities within and across Partnerships. Representatives from ACTION II Partnerships will be expected to participate in an annual face-to-face invitational meeting and periodic phone conferences and webinars. In addition, Partnerships and their members will be expected to be active users of the ACTION web portal described above (see Appendix 3).  For example, the prime Partner will be expected to help supply data for the knowledge repository and to maintain up-to-date contact information and profiles of its member organizations. ACTION Partnerships will be encouraged to avail themselves of portal collaboration tools such as web conferences, collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. 

In-Kind resources: A Partnerships commitment to a project increases when that project reflects the organizations own goals for, and investments in, quality improvement. While it is not a requirement, a willingness to commit in kind or other resources, if possible and appropriate for future task orders, is desirable. Most Partnerships will end up volunteering some staff time to ACTION II task orders. Such contributions are difficult to predict and quantify, and may depend on the type of organization involved.  However, AHRQ wants to both acknowledge such contributions and more accurately gauge the level and type of commitment provided by Partnerships. For these reasons, in kind resources should be accounted for by Partnerships in ACTION II proposals for specific future task orders, if and when they arise.

Guidelines/Instructions for Demonstrating Ability to Meet Performance Requirements

SECTION H  SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1	RELEASE AND USE AND COPYRIGHT OF DATA FIRST PRODUCED FROM WORK PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

(a)  Release and Use  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use  Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

H.13	AHRQ APPLICATION AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC).  This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases:

	Concept 
	Initiation
	Planning
	Requirements Analysis
	Design
	Development
	Testing
	Implementation / Deployment
	Operations and Maintenance
	Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects.   The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology.  The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by ARHQ.  The Rational ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. 

Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractors SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section.  It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain COTR approval before moving from one phase to another. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires  and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. 

The following table describes the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation 
The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the COTR for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agencys Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, Documentation Deliverables, are required by AHRQ. 
Project Initiation Document 

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COTR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID is satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.  

 
Project Work Plan

The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.  

System Requirements Document

The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

	Requirement ID, Name and Title
	Requirement Description
	Software Release Version
	Use Case Model
	Use Case Specifications
	Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.
Requirements Traceability Matrix

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the beginning of a projects lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements.  

The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation.  

The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

	Requirement ID and Title;
	The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;
	The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;
	The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;
	The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; 
	The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.

The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a projects life cycle.

 

System Design Document
The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.  

The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.

The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries. 

Test Plan
The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:
A.	Test Description 
	A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system. 
	Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit). 
	Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort. 
	A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process. 
B.	Acceptance Criteria 
	The criteria agreed upon with the customer for acceptance of the software. 
C.	Approach 
	How each major group of software features will be adequately tested.
	Major testing activities, techniques, and testing tools. 
	Test Environment  Hardware, Network, Software and Test Database
D.	Tasks
	The individual tasks that must be performed. 
	The individual or organization responsible for each task.
E.	Schedule, Resources & Milestones 
Test Scripts
The Test Scripts define testing scenarios completed for an application.  Each scenario details the steps to be performed, expected results and pass/fail criteria.  At a minimum the document should contain the following:
	Test Script Identifier 
	Test Description 
	Test Objective
	Test Environment/Setup including any required data such as Login credentials, etc.
	Mapping to specific requirements and design elements contained in the SRD and SDD 
	Step sequences and actions
	Expected Results
	Pass/Fail Criteria
	Actual Results
	Comments

User Acceptance Test Report
The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report should include a summary of the testing environment (hardware, software, tools, participant list, etc.) and procedures used to demonstrate and obtain stakeholder approval of the application or system prior to production deployment. The UAT Report should contain a mapping to the SRD and SDD items included in the release as well as an exception list or identified change requests that were generated as the result of testing. 

User Guide
The User Guide is completed prior to production.  The User Guide is a How To manual which navigates the user in detail through the use of the application.  This document usually contains system screen shots and provides step by step instructions for completing tasks and activities.  It is written on a business level with the needs of the user in mind.  At a minimum the document should contain the following content.
	Introduction
	Summary of the application
	Glossary (Definitions/Acronyms)
	Procedures (Step-by Step instructions on how to use the system)
	Troubleshooting tips
Operations Manual
The Operations Manual provides guidance and defines procedures related to the operational implementation of the system. At a minimum, the document should contain the following: 

	System Overview

	Recovery Instructions - Describe the steps required to reconstruct the release from the product baselines, established in the configuration management library.

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines 
 
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources.  

Guidelines for Web-Based Products
 
Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum requirements:
 



Titles of Products

Coordinate with your COTR on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word counteliminate initial articles such as The or A ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products.

Quality Control/Editorial Review

This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style.  This should be done by the AHRQ grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: 
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.
 
Intellectual Property Rights

Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions:

	Who retains the copyright?
	Who has licenses for what purposes and uses?
	What are the constraints imposed?
	Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability 

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html

Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release.
 
Privacy Act Protections

Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools. Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 
Guidelines for Web Sites
 
Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws, policies, and directives that affect such resources. 

This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources. 

For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to:  http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml

Clearance 

Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate departmental clearance. 

Domain Names 

All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by FirstGov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The FirstGov link is then required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests. 

Editorial Review

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility 

Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov

Privacy

A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected.  Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. 

Web Site Mailbox

Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. 

Records Management

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to:
http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html

Information Collection Budget

If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection.  

 
Intellectual Property

Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue. 

Linking

External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of a specific commercial product or service. 

Electronic FOIA

The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site. 

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. Go to http://www.usability.gov as a reference for best practices in initial development or redesign of Web resources. 

Web Sponsor Identity

AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a consistent look and feel of Web resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are:
 
	Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov).
	Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal.
	HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web site. 
	Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.

H. 14	TASK ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES

All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs) signed by the Contracting Officer and accepted by the Contractor.  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.    

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

Each Contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of one task order during the 3-year base contract. The minimum dollar amount guaranteed per Contractor is $25,000.  The purpose of this task order is to provide for general management and administrative work that is not directly attributable to a particular task order topic.  Services requested under this task order will be obtained on an as-needed basis through issuance of specific work assignments, as directed by the Task Order Officer (TOO).

1)	Travel to AHRQ or other locations for meetings concerning ACTION II as directed by the TOO. These funds are not to be used for meetings relating to a specific task order, but rather for the purpose of the overall initiative.
2)	Miscellaneous work associated with the general management and administration of this task order and other assignments as determined by the TOO.
It is expected that TOs will average between $250,000 and $750,000 and last between eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being twelve months.  There may be circumstances where the amount and duration of task orders exceed these average amounts.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

	Procedures for Issuance of TOs

	1.	Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each TO.  Factors such as past performance, quality of deliverables, cost control, price, cost, or other factors that the Contracting Officer believes are relevant to the placement of orders will be considered.

	2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee.

	3.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on cost, technical merit, and any other relevant factors.

4.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

		E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $2500.

	5.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

	6.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the fixed maximum labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

	7.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

8.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

	9.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

	10.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

11.	Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily electronically through e-mail or internet but they can also be issued by facsimile or mail.  Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities.  When a RFTO is issued, the Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost/price information for performing the required services.  Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 

K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

(c)	The Contractor shall include this clause in every subcontract and purchase order that is subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this contract.

III.	Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts

K.7.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

1)  It has filed all Federal tax returns required during the three years preceding this certification;

2) It has not been convicted of a criminal offense under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and

(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.
(ii)	 The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

	a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that a cost-reimbursement, task order type contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.  To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

		I.	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.

II.	PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.11)

	c.	Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 3 parts:  

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; and (3) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.


L.10	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

The technical proposal shall contain an original and twelve (12) hard copies, plus two electronic copies on CD.   The technical proposal described below shall be limited to 100 pages not including biographic sketches, with no less than a 11 point font, double-spaced (lists of deliverables, person loading charts, and similar materials need not be double-spaced, so long as they are legible).

The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, labor mix, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of these instructions. Lengthy proposals and voluminous appendices are neither needed nor desired as they are difficult to read and evaluate and may indicate the offerors inability to concisely state their proposal. Appendices are to be provided electronically in MS Office format on CD, in the same quantity as the technical proposal.

	a.	Recommended Technical Proposal Format

The offerors proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.

		(1)	Cover Page:  The name of the proposing organization, list of proposed subcontractors, author(s) of the technical proposal, the RFP number and the title of the RFP should appear on the cover.

L.13	BUSINESS PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

The offeror shall submit as part of the proposal a separate enclosure titled Business Proposal for each proposal being submitted.  The Business Proposal shall include the Cost/Price Proposal and Other Administrative Data in accordance with the following:

	A.	Cost/Price Proposal

	A cost proposal, in the amount of an original and five (5) hard copies, plus two electronic copies on CD, shall be provided only to the extent that it shall include:

	1.  	Certified, unloaded, labor rates for individuals expected to work on a project of this size and nature.  See the attached Proposal Specifications which provides a list of the specific labor categories.   Labor rates or ranges of rates shall be indicated for each labor category. 

		2.	A statement certifying that the offeror has a cost accounting system in place which allows for the collection, tracking and reporting of all costs under a cost reimbursement-type contract.

		3.	Certified documentation that the offeror has a current indirect cost rate agreement in place with a federal agency or that is in the process of obtaining or revising such an agreement.  A copy of the indirect cost rate agreement or the proposed rate agreement shall be provided.


B.	Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  

All offerors except small businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, incorporated in this solicitation for any task orders that are estimated to be above $550,000.  The plan will only be required when a Request for Task Order Proposal is issued that is estimated to be above $550,000 and does not need to be submitted as part of this proposal.  A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed in the offerors format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan when requested by a specific RFTO, the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without further consideration. 

This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  This provision does apply to all other offerors, including large business concerns, colleges, universities and non-profit organizations.

		The term subcontract means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract.  This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/ purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment purchase, copying services, and travel services.

		The offeror understands that:

a.	No Task Order above the threshold will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer. The plan will be incorporated into the Task Order.

b.	An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the Task Order.

c.	If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.

d.	Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

e.	It is the offerors responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offerors plan will be judged independent of the other.

f.	The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.  Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government Contracting Officer or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractors designated small and disadvantaged business liaison.

	e.	The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP. 

L.15	PROPOSAL INTENT

It is requested that if an offeror intends to submit a proposal to this solicitation that the attached Proposal Intent Form (Attachment 3) be completed and returned to the address indicated by March 1, 2010.  The submission of the intent form is not binding on an offeror to submit a proposal, nor does the failure to submit the form prohibit an offeror from submitting a proposal.  The purpose is to provide us with an estimated number of proposals to assist us in our planning and logistics for proposal reviews.  We have added a request to include your contact information to a bidders list.  The bidders list will be provided to interested offerors for subcontracting opportunities.  In order for AHRQ to include your contact information on the bidders list, you must return the Proposal Intent Form and check the box that grants permission to add your name no later than the date listed above.
SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  The four factors are: scientific technical merit, cost, past performance.  The scientific technical merit of the proposals will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor(s) for this acquisition.  Offerors that submit technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated for past performance. Following these evaluations a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all. 


THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION

The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.  The evaluation factors and assigned weights which will be used in the overall review of the offerors proposal are outlined below.  The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to evaluation criteria 1 through 3 (including subcriteria). The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the evaluation of each criteria below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation:


OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE: Evaluation Criteria 1 through 3, for  a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a peer review technical committee that will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal. Program staff and contracting personnel will review and evaluate Criteria 4 for a total of 25 points. The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria 1 though 4 are 125 points.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  SUBCONTRACT, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBAs PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _30__% for small business (SB), _11_% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _3__% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ___5__% for women-owned business (WOSB), __3__% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the following goals, at a minimum, _____% for small business, ____% small disadvantaged business, ____% for HubZone businesses, ______% for   woman owned businesses, and ______% for veteran-owned businesses.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal. 

NOTE TO CONTRACTORS:  Please provide your CCS number with your Dun & Bradstreet number.

In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.

APPENDIX 1

Frequently Asked Questions

A. Questions on Composition of Partnerships

1) Please define an "offeror"?  Is the entire partnership considered to be an "offeror" or is only one of the partners an offeror and others are subcontractors/collaborators?

From AHRQs perspective, offeror refers primarily to the partnership as a whole. The participants in the partnership consist of the prime, or lead, organization with which AHRQ will contract, and its subcontractors/collaborators.
 
2) Can a subcontractors/collaborator organization participate on two separate proposals from two different offerors?

Yes, an organization can collaborate with more than one prime (i.e., the lead organization) in a partnership. 

3) Would it be permissible for ACTION II to fund partnerships that include organizations based outside the United States?

AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. In order to meet ACTION IIs objectives and to assist in meeting AHRQ's mission, this program is expected to attract and consider offers from US-based healthcare delivery systems that serve US populations and have access to US healthcare system data. 

B. Questions on Process

4) Will ACTION II contract awardees be awarded any funds immediately, or do partnership awardees constitute a "pool" from which AHRQ will develop and solicit proposals for contract task orders at future dates? 

Each prime awardee will receive an initial task order for $25,000 to help defray the cost of travel to occasional ACTION II meetings for partnership representatives, and other miscellaneous administrative tasks. Aside from this initial task order, AHRQ will indeed develop Requests for Task Order at future dates and solicit proposals from ACTION II partnerships. 

5)  Are partnerships to include ideas for task orders in their responses to the ACTION II RFP, or are they simply applying for a contract to become an ACTION contract awardee?  

Ideas for task orders are not requested and should not be included in the proposal.

6) Will the ACTION partnerships participate in the development of future potential tasks and requests for task order?

Yes, submission of 1-2 page concepts for Requests for Task Order is anticipated to be encouraged from all sources:  the ACTION partnerships, AHRQ staff, co-funding organizations, HHS, and others.  The Requests for Task Order themselves are generally developed by AHRQ staff.  Staff from co-funding organizations will also be involved in this process if co-funding is obtained. 

C. Questions on Past Performance

7) If past performance of the organizations involved is in terms of research grants (e.g. NIH RO1 type and foundations), rather than contracts, how will this record be evaluated? Are these organizations at a disadvantage if they do not have past contract experience?

Past performance evaluations on relevant contracts are preferred because they show the offerors performance on quality, cost control, timeliness and business relations.  If an offeror does not have relevant past performance evaluations on contracts, past performance evaluations on relevant grants will be considered.

8) Is past performance information required from all individual organizations within the partnership?

Past performance of the partnership as an entity is highly desirable. However, if the partnership is entirely new or includes new collaborators, past performance of individual collaborating organizations should be included. Please note that if an organization has a proposed subcontractor submitting a Past Performance evaluation form on this procurement, the name of the Prime Contractor should be included in order to be evaluated as part of the correct partnership.

9) If collaborators in a partnership have held federal contracts, and their performance on those contracts is relevant to the partnership's ability to demonstrate past performance quality, may these be included in the past performance evaluations?

Yes

10) It is the responsibility of the partnerships to ensure that their past performance evaluations are completed and forwarded on time directly to AHRQ by the contracting organizations listed in the Past Performance submission.  Can partnerships ask the contracting organizations to cc them on their responses to ensure that AHRQ has been sent the evaluations and that they should have been received on time?

Past performance evaluations are to be completed confidentially; offerors may not see the evaluations being submitted. Partnerships should emphasize to their evaluation contract organizations that evaluations must be received on time. Only those evaluations received by the date specified in the solicitation will be considered.  

11) How should relevant projects that have been funded internally by a health care provider as part of its operations or research and development be handled?  Should such projects be included in the organizational and corporate experience section of the technical proposal but not in the past performance section, since there are no external funders/clients to complete the past performance questionnaire and contractor performance form?

Yes, past performance evaluations should only be requested from external customers.
12) How many projects should be evaluated for the partnership as a whole? Does the number of evaluations vary with the size of the partnership?
Five relevant projects total should suffice unless the partnership is very large, in which case a few more examples could be added. 
D. Questions on Labor Categories and Rates

13) Although the RFP states that contractors shall be reimbursed for costs incurred for labor based on hourly rates, no rates are listed.  Is the offeror to provide the Proposed Labor Rates for each of the Years listed?

Yes, the offeror is to propose the Proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Ranges, for each of the Years listed for each of the six labor categories. The cost analysis will consist of establishing a Labor Category Hourly Rate Range for the six Labor Categories (I, II, III, IV, V and VI). 

14)  With regard to the presentation of labor rates by class level and year, would it be sufficient to provide a range, established on the basis of a sample of rates, within which we intend to stay?  Also, is there a specific inflation factor that should be used to show these labor rates in the out years or is the commonly used 3-4% acceptable?
 
A representative sample of positions that could be averaged to propose each Labor Category Hourly Rate Range per class is requested. The negotiations for the proposed Labor Category Hourly Rate Range will include the evaluation of the reasonableness of the individual cost components (unburdened rate, indirect rates and fee/ profit, if applicable.)  The recommended labor escalation rate for future Government Fiscal Years should be approximately 3%. 

15) Is certified documentation of an indirect rate agreement approved for federal awards only necessary for the prime organization or for the other participants in the partnership as well?

It is required for the prime organization and each participant in the partnership as well If an indirect rate is not established by the time of contract award, the organization will be provided up to 90 days to establish the indirect cost rate.  

E. Questions on Participant Characteristics and Key Personnel

16) From the table in Appendix 4 it appears that some partner organizations should be providers/insurers.  In the section on partnership eligibility however, the list of organizations eligible to be included is much broader.  Please clarify.  Should Appendix 4 be completed for each partner organization or should it be a summary of all partner organizations including the offeror?

The table in Appendix 4 serves the purpose of very roughly summarizing for reviewers some characteristics of any participating organizations for which the named characteristics apply , particularly those serving patients, residents or health plan enrollees. Offerors are encouraged to present these characteristics either for the partnership as a whole or for individual participants in the partnership. AHRQs preference would be to report by organization, if feasible. Offerors are also encouraged to present, in similar table format, any desired complementary information (e.g., number of employers in a coalition and the employer characteristics.)   

17) Can the key personnel include people from each of the partner organizations?  Can major subcontractors be key personnel?  Should it be assumed that each partner organization has a key person tied to it?

Yes, key personnel may include persons from collaborating organizations as well as the prime organization. It is correct to assume that each collaborating organization should have a designated main contact. 

18) If the chart in Appendix 4 that documents delivery system settings and providers does not fit the offeror partnerships model of health care delivery. may an offeror redesign this table in order to document the types of services provided by its programs in the way which best reflects program reality? 

Feel free to add information in a separate table that may better reflect the components of the partnership in question. 

F. Questions on Small and Disadvantaged Businesses
19) Could AHRQ clarify the similarities and differences between a Small Business Subcontracting Plan and a Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan?   Could AHRQ clarify which of these two Plans should be addressed when an awardee responds to a task order?  
The requirement for the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and the Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be required only for task orders in excess of $500,000. The purpose of the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (FAR 19.704  )is to  provide information as to how an offeror plans to meet the DHHS/ AHRQ (departmental) goals for socioeconomic contracting for the instant procurement (particular task order in this case).   The Small Business Subcontract Plan will be negotiated on an as needed basis.   

The Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan (FAR 19.12) is a plan that provides information on how the organization as a whole has subcontracted with disadvantaged businesses in the past and how it plans to do so in the future.

20)  While the offeror realizes that no formal Subcontracting Plan or Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan is required with the initial proposal submission, and is only required at the Request for Task Order level, please clarify the SBA requirements that a prime contractor's small business percentages are derived from the total planned subcontract amount on Task Order proposals, not a percentage of the total Task Order value. 
 
The small business percentages would be derived from the total planned subcontract amount on the Task Order proposal.  Note the Task Order proposal amount may change as a result of negotiation. 

21) The RFP indicates that a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be requested if a future Task Order meets or exceeds the $500,000 threshold.  Could AHRQ clarify whether a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan should be included in the current proposal response to this RFP and if so, is this applicable both to the prime and to major subcontractors (if any of them are not small businesses)?  Is there any added value for including Small Disadvantaged Business Participation plan in the current proposal application?   

The proposal is not required to include either a Small Business Subcontracting Plan or a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan in order to be responsive to the RFP.  The submission of a Small Business Participation Plan with the proposal would add no value to the proposal. 

G. Question on Review Committee

22) Will there be any non-academically affiliated health care provider organizations represented on the ACTION II proposal review committee? 

AHRQs statute requires that all contract proposals are peer reviewed by reviewers who do not have a conflict of interest with any of the offerors participating organizations.  Reviewers names remain confidential and are not be released even through the Freedom of Information Act in order to ensure an impartial evaluation. AHRQ appreciates your suggestion.
 
H. Question on Proposal Delivery to AHRQ 

23) Please indicate whether other express mail services (such as UPS or Federal Express) may be used to deliver the proposal AHRQs Rockville, Maryland address and if there are security restrictions that would delay timely receipt of a proposal using express or other mail services.  

The offeror may use any express mail carrier it chooses. The offeror assumes responsibility for that choice (i.e., an error or delay encountered by the express carrier is the responsibility of the offeror).  Please be cautioned that security restrictions at AHRQ may delay timely receipt of a proposal.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure the proposal arrives on or before the deadline. Also be cautioned that a proposal missing any required components (e.g., insufficient number of copies) will not be accepted.






















APPENDIX 2

AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market ACTION II research products and findings resulting from ACTION II task orders. 

                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makersincluding patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakerswith up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management. 





















APPENDIX 3 

SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ACTION PARTNERSHIPS


NEED TO ADD SOMETHING HERE REFERRING TO THE ININTIAL TASK ORDER FOR +/- $25 K FOR TRAVEL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRIME COORDINATING FUNCTION.

ACTION II Portal

AHRQ will develop and maintain an ACTION II portal to enhance collaborative efforts for all ACTION partnerships. The portal will include tools to support dialogue and collaboration, such as web conferencing capability, provision of collaborative work spaces, technical assistance request processes, online reporting and assessment, a suggestion box and threaded discussion lists. The portal will serve as an avenue for communication between Task Order Officers or other ACTION II staff, and contractors. The portal may be used to host teleconferences or webinars to solicit input or feedback from ACTION II members or to provide members with technical support or information updates.   External task order funders or co-sponsors may have the opportunity to communicate with ACTION II members through the portal as well.  

ACTION II Partnerships will play an active and continuing role in creating and updating a comprehensive knowledge repository to be housed on the ACTION II portal.  This data bank will contain profiles with contact information for each ACTION II Partnership, as well as documents and resources of interest to members (e.g. relevant literature, tools, products, health data resources, evaluation instruments, templates, project management resources). 
, for example: contact information for partnership members, profiles for each of these members, a library of ACTION II-related templates and examples of documents, relevant published literature, and a calendar of events of interest.  

AHRQ will provide technical staff to operate and maintain portal software applications. The portal will maximize security and data privacy. 

Technical Assistance

On a case by case basis, technical assistance will be available to ACTION II Partnerships for:
1.	OMB clearance package development 
2.	Adherence to 508 compliance and web product requirements for all electronic deliverables
3.	Dissemination, communication and marketing for selected deliverables intended for public release


1.	OMB Clearance Package Development  

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance is an outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It was designed to minimize the burden that data collection activities might have on the public and to ensure the quality and utility of the information collected. OMB clearance is used interchangeably with ICR Clearance (Information Collection Request Clearance) or PRA Clearance (Paperwork Reduction Act Clearance). 

OMB Clearance is needed for all federal contract research if any data collection activities involve ten or more respondents for whom the questions are standardized in nature. This includes any instances where an interview schedule composed of a set of core questions will be used for 10 or more subjects, even if it is modified for subgroups of nine or fewer interviewees (e.g. doctors vs. nurses, managers vs. front-line employees). These data collection activities include research project surveys, interviews, questionnaires, epidemiology studies, health risk factor assessments, and evaluations. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Clearance and OMB Clearance are two separate clearances. Having one of the two clearances does not negate the need for the other. 

The normal OMB Clearance process currently takes approximately 7-9 months from beginning to end.  More details about the timeline are available at http://www.os.dhhs.gov/ocio/policy/collection/infocollectiontimeline.html.  An OMB Clearance Package includes a number of documents and processes. These include:

a.  83-I: A Form that provides a listing of the information required under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of which copies are submitted with each package to be reviewed by OMB.  
b.  Supporting Statement:  The supporting statement consists of two parts and follows a standard format.  Section A provides the justification for the proposed data collection activity and Section B outlines the statistical methods and design. The supporting statement is generally prepared by the group contracted to conduct the research on behalf of AHRQ.

c. Attachments: Any additional materials supporting the proposed data collection or instruments that will be used as part of the study are included as attachments, such as data collection instrument(s); a copy of the Federal Register Notice; a copy of instructions or letters sent to respondents describing the study; a copy of applicable sections of laws or regulations regarding the data collection (may not be applicable); and a list of consulted individuals (if a focus group or expert panel was consulted during the development of the data collection instrument). 

ACTION II Partnerships must comply with OMB Clearance for task orders whenever applicable (see Requirement #12 in SOW).  Thus, each ACTION II Partnership will be required to identify an individual or small team within the lead Partner organization to be responsible for ensuring that such federal requirements are met and coordinating all activities associated with doing so. 

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to obtain OMB Clearances and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request to subcontract for the expertise, using task order award funds, through a pre-arranged AHRQ contractor. Arrangements to work with the subcontractor to develop the OMB Clearance package shall be included in the technical proposal and the cost of the subcontract shall be included in the cost proposal for the task order in question. That is to say, whether the proposal team requests a subcontractor through AHRQ or supplies the expertise itself, technical proposals will be required to include details on how these needs will be met and by whom, and cost proposals will be required to include associated personnel hours, other resources and costs.

2. Adherence to Section 508 Compliance and Web Product Requirements 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 
There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format - including text, audio or video - that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 
All contractors and subcontractors or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards as codified in 36 CFR Part 1194, and where applicable, those set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). Remediation of any materials that do not comply with all necessary accessibility standards shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.  Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

Some Partnerships already may have the required expertise within their project team to meet these federal requirements for electronic products and may not require additional technical assistance. In such cases, the contractor must include in task order proposals evidence of that expertise within the project team and demonstrated success in fulfilling any such requirements related to the proposed work. If the team does not have the required expertise, it can request assistance from AHRQs Section 508 Technical Assistance Center (www.ahrw.gov/508tac/tacover.htm). The Centers web page includes a menu of services and the charges related to each requested service. Services include: conversion and remediation of developed, non-compliant products, training and education, and consulting and expert services.  If a Partnership plans to avail itself of specific Section 508 Technical Assistance Center services, the technical task order proposal shall include information on necessary tasks to be accomplished via a subcontract with Section 508 Technical Assistance Center staff; the cost of the required services shall be included in the cost proposal. 

In addition to assistance with adherence to Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act, the Center can assist with website usability of task order products, and other HHS and federal regulations regarding management, privacy and security of IT systems, and/or designing websites and creating website graphics. Technical assistance will be available for ACTION II contractors that need help to support evolving user needs for electronic products, or improved system administration, performance, search, navigation and usability for such products. In addition, technical assistance may include development of websites and other electronic products that are in full compliance with all relevant sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition to the Section 508 compliance Web resources provided above, information on accessibility can be found at: 
o	www.access-board.gov/508.htm
o	www.usability.gov 

4. Dissemination, Communication and Marketing

Simply providing information to potential users is insufficient to generate substantial rates of actual use of the information by specific target audiences. A key to successful implementation in health care delivery is to more closely link researchers, users and other decision makers to ensure both the usefulness of information generated and the actual use of that information in practice. The literature suggests that actual use of research increases when:
	The research findings meet the expressed needs of the target audience
	Short-term and long-term information-sharing relationships and networks are created between researchers and target audiences
	An integrated set of strategies and tactics, specifically designed to support practical use of research, is employed over a substantial period of time. 

For ACTION II project results considered by AHRQ to merit further investment in dissemination, communication and marketing, technical assistance from AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) may include, but is not limited to: 
	creation of varied and appropriate dissemination products and vehicles
	assistance in determining the most appropriate target audiences and the content needs of those audiences
	performing and promoting website marketing and dissemination; and/or convening technical expert panels and meetings
	identifying, conducting, preparing and delivering educational activities, teleconferences and webinars
	identifying opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas, approaches, best practices and lessons learned across AHRQ grantees, contractors and project initiatives, and coordinating and facilitating identified common activities and interests across these efforts where cost-effective
	providing assistance in use of health information exchanges, IT networks, connectivity, hardware, software, interoperability and standards
	designing and offering special, limited technical assistance engagements, to meet the needs of regional AHRQ partners, stakeholders and others in their project efforts.
	Reviewing awardee final reports and findings, providing summaries of key findings, lessons learned and best practices identified while providing technical assistance.
	devising adoption strategies that can be readily accepted and are likely to be sustained. Examples may include issue papers, briefs, implementation stories, podcasts, Webinars, etc. 

The value of task order deliverables for intended audiences it is not always known with certainty in advance. As such, this level of dissemination, communication and marketing activity is not necessarily expected to be included in a task order proposal.  However, if AHRQ deems that additional dissemination, communication and marketing for a specific deliverable is likely to have potential value, the Partners involved will be expected to work collaboratively with OCKT staff to  at a minimum - familiarize them with the features, benefits and limitations of the task order deliverables in question.

The IT tools should allow for a wide-range of information in the form of animations, commentary, reports, graphs, tables, and maps to be distributed to a number of stakeholders. To measure progress, the project will be considered 50% complete when "version 1" of the program has been distributed to the local contingency of scouts for use, and 75% complete when input can be gathered in the field with PDA and then downloaded to the main server for processing. The project will be considered complete, when the end-user has been trained by company personnel and the software/program/IT system performs as described above. </span></p>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s).

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features:	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available. 	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.  	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.<BR><BR>	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network. 	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows. 	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system. 	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  According to F5, the only provider of F5 Big IP service is F5.<BR><BR>Line Item Pricing Must Be Broken Out In Order For Seller's Bid To Be Considered For Award.<BR><BR>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s).

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features:	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available. 	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.  	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.<BR><BR>	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network. 	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows. 	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system. 	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  According to F5, the only provider of F5 Big IP service is F5.<BR><BR>Line Item Pricing Must Be Broken Out In Order For Seller's Bid To Be Considered For Award. Lapse Service Fees Must Be Included For Each Line Item.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items - as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued.     This solicitation is a Request for Quote (RFQ).     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.

This is a total small business set aside  under NAICS Code 334112 with a size standards of 1,000 employees, competitive procurement for Premium 24 x7 maintenance support services for Blue Arc Corporation brand hardware and software products that are currently in use by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) campuses in Gaithersburg, Maryland and Boulder, Colorado.  NIST will only consider offers from companies that are currently authorized by BlueArc Corporation to sell BlueArc products and services. Only BlueArc Corporation brand support will be considered.

The current NIST BlueArc environment requires that NIST maintain a support contract in order to diagnose system problems and to obtain and apply routine and emergency fixes to ensure that NIST is able to provide adequate application support and ensure application and data integrity. To support this effort, a service contract with BlueArc must be maintained to provide onsite maintenance within a 4 hour notice.

Acquiring maintenance from a source other than BlueArc would introduce the possibility of operating system incompatibilities, which could result in corruption of data.

Period of performance for the services required Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) 0001 through 0002 in this RFQ is February 1, 2010 through January 31, 2011.

CLIN 0001 (Quantity: 1; Unit: Lot): BlueArc Premium 24 x7 Service for NIST Boulder, Colorado Items Listed in Attachment 1

CLIN 0002 (Quantity: 1; Unit: Lot): ): BlueArc Premium 24 x7 Service for NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland Items Listed in Attachment 1

Delivery for Item Numbers 0001 through 0002 shall be FOB DESTINATION.     
Provisions and clauses that apply to this RFQ may be downloaded at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.     The following provisions apply to this acquisition:     FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5 (including the following fill-ins: 52.203-6 Alternate I; 52.219-4; 52.219-8; 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.222-50; 52.222-51; 52.225-13; 52.232-33).

Quotation Submission Instructions: 

Offerors shall include the following in their quote:       (1) The solicitation number; (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the Offeror; (3) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (4) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price for each item stated in 
Attachment 1, a firm-fixed lot price for each  CLIN (CLINs 0001 through 0002 above),  and any discount terms; (5) Proof that the Offeror currently has Blue Arc authorized reseller status; (6) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(k) for those representations and certifications that the Offeror shall complete electronically); (7) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; and (8) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449 form, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation.

Evaluation Factors for Award:

Award will be made to the Blue Arc-authorized Offeror whose quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price, technically acceptable offer.

Clauses that will be included in the resultant award include those included in this RFQ except for 52.212-1 and 52.212-3, which apply only to the solicitation.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed-price contract no later than January 29, 2010 for support to start on February 1, 2010.

Potential Offerors shall direct all questions via e-mail to Janine Kerns at janine.kerns@nist.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.
<p><br />1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contract Specialist. They must be received no later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 423430. This requirement is being competed under unrestricted full and open competition whereby IBM-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.<br /><br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.<br />The Information Access Division's Biometrics Research Lab has two IBM HS22 enclosures with 12 blades in each enclosure for a total of 24 IBM blades. The IBM HS22 blades were originally shipped without hard drives. The hard drives are needed for when the blades run local SDK evaluations to support biometric research lab work.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />This request is for a brand name only purchase of IBM hard drives with the specifications listed below. The hard drives are shipped in specially designed, proprietary, IBM carriers that allow for hot swapping the drives while the system is running. NIST currently has a 3-year onsite repair service pack warranty (9 am to 5 pm, 4 hour response) with IBM on the HS22 enclosures. In order to maintain the warranty conditions we must use one of the following replacement part numbers provided by IBM: 42D0709, 42D0708, and 42D0707 (IBM 500GB 7200 6Gbps NL SAS 2.5" SFF Slim-HS HDD). <br /><br />The following items are required:<br />IBM Hard Drives<br />Part #: One of the following: 42D0709, 42D0708, or 42D0707<br />Quantity: 85<br />Specifications: 500GB 6Gbps SAS 2.5"SFF</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are IBM-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.

CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features:	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available. 	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.  	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.<BR><BR>	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network. 	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows. 	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system. 	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  According to F5, the only provider of F5 Big IP service is F5.<BR><BR>

<p>4)      The pics provided show conduit, but the spec does not mention anything electrical. Pls clarify.</p>
<p>5)      There is no requirement for the studs to be mechanically fastened to the interior of the container. Pls clarify.</p>
<p>ANSWERS:</p>
<p>1)  If local it will be picked up via will call otherwise shipping will be paid for by the government and setup/handled by our shipper.<br />2)  You can end this sentence with " The rear wall will be 10" ~ 20" on center. ".  The "jindo type" container might come with several different corrogation<br />variations - dimensions that can vary slightly between manufacturers so this was intended to be a catch-all phase.<br />3) &amp; 4) The pictures are just examples of unistrut configuration on the bulkead's vertical and horizontal surfaces . There is no request for electrical in this spec sheet. We do that in house after the shell is built!<br />5)  With the header type construction the verticle studs can be tow nailed to the wooden floor at the bottom and the ceiling joist sits or caps on top of the wall plate. When the unistrut is applied to all the studs it acts like a roll bar cage and stiffens the whole structure &amp; secures it.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) in coordination with the United States Air Force Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) 705 CTS intends to issue a contract, FA9422-10-C-0001, to acquire technical support services. This 8-1/2 month bridge contract will provide technical and analytical expertise for the execution of DMOC training events, tests, and experimentation activities and system development in support of battlespace operations until a competitive small business set-aside competition can be completed and an adequate contractor transition performed. This is a continuation of effort to the existing Technical Support Contract (TSC) currently performed by Scientific Research Corporation (SRC), 2300 Windy Ridge Parkway, Ste 400 South, Atlanta, GA 30339-8431. <br />
<p><br />AFNWC/PKE intends to award a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2). Award to another contractor will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which cannot be recovered through competition, and presents unacceptable delays which would jeopardize up to 21 joint, agency and coalition training programs.</p>
<p>Based on an evaluation of Statements of Capability submitted in response to the sources sought notice issued on 22 Dec 09 for this effort, AFNWC/PKE and the 705 CTS program office concluded that only the incumbent, SRC, possesses both the capability and experience necessary to effectively provide DMOC 705/CTS with continued technical analysis support until completion of the competed requirement. SRC was the only contractor that adequately demonstrated the ability to provide the knowledge, skill and experience while meeting all the security requirements to perform DMOC's mission without work stoppage.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Capabilities information, which shall not exceed 20-pages in length, may be emailed to: cassandra.caputo@kirtland.af.mil. Responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Justification and Approval document for sole source award will follow shortly. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to the Government Points of Contact: Ms. Cassandra Caputo (email: cassandra.caputo@kirtland.af.mil, phone: 505-846-7812) or Ms. Donna Heinz (email: donna.heinz@kirtland.af.mil, phone at 505-846-9516).</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a contractor-owned/contractor-leased, contractor-operated correctional facility to house a population of approximately 1,750 low security, adult male inmates, that are primarily criminal aliens with ordinarily 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences. The population of approximately 1,750 inmates is presently housed at the McRae Correctional Facility in McRae, Georgia. The current contract will expire on 11/30/2012. <br />
<p><br />The BOP anticipates this requirement will be fulfilled through a single award. A proposed facility may be either an existing facility, a newly constructed facility, or an existing facility with expansion/renovation. Any new construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solictation/contract. The proposed facility may be located anywhere in the continental United States.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Shared services within each fence line is not acceptable.</p>
<p>A Notice to Proceed shall be issued to the contractor when it is ready to accept inmates, which shall occur no later than 12/1/2012.</p>

Foley U.S. Federal Courthouse in Spokane, Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Engineering Service Division (ESD), Elizabeth City, NC, intends to competitively acquire engineering processes, technical and training support for the Coast Guard's logistics transformation effort and to sustain current users of the Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS). Requirements exist for support services in the following locations: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Elizabeth City, NC, Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Baltimore, MD, and the Aviation Training Center (ATC) in Mobile, AL.</p>
<p>Asset Logistics Management Information System (ALMIS) has long been employed by Coast Guard Air Stations as a means to track maintenance actions and operational data of Coast Guard aircraft; specifically the Electronic Asset Logbook (EAL) and Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) functions of the system. EAL and ACMS programs are vital to the logistical support of Coast Guard assets by; tracking usage rates, documenting scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, ensuring asset configuration integrity, and documenting operational data. Based upon the success of the system, the Logistics Transformation Program Integration Office (LTPIO) will be expanding the use of ALMIS to include all assets in the Coast Guard. The Decision Support System (DSS) is a module in ALMIS that provides; integrated help, web reports and Power Play Cubes. A cube is a file that is created by aggregating data along a number of dimensions and storing it in such a way that it can be accessed quickly. All the dimensions in this cube can be accessed and changed in a rapid manner. The data might be operational hours including dimensions such as time, unit, and asset number. Coast Guard active duty, government employees and some contractors located at Coast Guard Headquarter\Areas\Districts\Air Stations\Sectors\Groups\Units and Cutters must be trained to gain the ability to perform operational and maintenance data entry and analysis using ALMIS. IMPROTANT: The Coast Guard is not entertaining new software and/or hardware configuration. The anticipated release date for the Request for Proposed (RFP), HSCG38-10-R-500004 will be on or about the 11 February 2010 with an anticipated closing date and time for submission 10 March 2010 at 2:00 P.M. local time. The solicitation and all corresponding documents will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. An award of a firm-fixed price IDIQ competitive contract to the offeror whose conformance to the RFP will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered is anticipated. The Government intends to make a single award. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 518210, which has a small business size standard of $25M annual revenue. THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR 8(a) CERTIFIED FIRMS SERVICED BY THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 8(a) PROGRAM. Only 8(a) certified firms will be considered for award. The period of performance will be for a total of 3 years consisting of a one year-base period (01 April 2010 through 31 March 2011) followed two one-year option periods.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>As part of the Recovery Act, the U.S. Army is interested in supporting research in the area of renewable energy, specifically for the co-generation of cooling, heating, and power from waste heat sources. Waste heat sources may include but are not limited to diesel engine exhaust gases, engine cooling fluids, and ambient airstreams.  Goals of the development include advanced technology demonstration for commercial and military applications, miniaturization of components, and thermodynamic cycle enhancement for improved energy efficiency, with associated development of innovative thermal system components. The U.S. Army is interested in basic and applied research, development, and demonstration of small, lightweight, efficient environmental control technology for use in various applications in capacities ranging from 6k BTUhr to 120k BTUhr. The technology shall operate within an ambient air temperature from 0 to +125 degrees Fahrenheit.
