<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to notify the public of the intent of the Dept. of Energy (DOE), Idaho Operations Office (ID) to proceed on a single source basis to William Lettis & Associates (WLA) of Walnut Creek, California. WLA will provide technical support to this office via participation as a team member in the 10 year update of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratorys (INL) probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA).  The PSHA will be performed by Bechtel Energy Alliance, DOE IDs chief management and operations contractor.  WLA will be involved in a team review of the approach, conduct and finalization of the PSHA.  The performance of a PSHA is a requirement under 10 CFR 830, DOE Order 420.1 and supporting standards.  Participatory review is supported by DOE Order 413.3b, NUREG-6372 and NRC guidance on the use of experts.  The objective of this effort is to avoid previous DOE seismic design defensibility issues encountered at other sites and improve the quality, defensibility and utility of the INL PSHA.  WLA will conduct a literature review, participate in group workshops, possibly participate in field review(s) and perform analytical work to test the utility and/or defensibility of proposed parameterization schemes and the impact of parameterization uncertainty on hazard design levels. WLA and its personnel are uniquely qualified for this effort as they possess unique field and analytical skills and experience directly related to the conduct and review of the  INL PSHA.  WLA personnel have conducted PSHAs for critical facilities in the regions adjacent to the INL (such as the Jackson Lake Dam PSHA).  WLA also possesses significant experience in the NUREG-6372 processes as well as INL specific seismologic, geologic and probabilistic modeling experience critical for performing this support function. Work duration is estimated to be three to six months (March  August) with travel to the INL for a meeting to discuss and review the proposed PSHA procedures, data, and analytical processes.  Estimated cost for this effort is approximately $25,000 on a time and materials basis. Any sources believing themselves capable of performing this work must submit a statement of capability applicable to this subject work to the Contract Specialist no later than March 7, 2008.  A solicitation document is not available.  Any requests for a solicitation will be disregarded. Capability statements will be evaluated solely to determine if this simplified acquisition should proceed on a competitive basis, rather than on a sole source basis.

<SOLNBR>FA8675-C-07-ALTLNCH

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION - Air Force Subscale Aerial Targets (AFSAT) - Alternate Launch Capability - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to award a sole source modification to an existing contract (FA8675-07-C-0280) with Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 92632 for the contractor to develop an alternative to the current Rocket-Assisted Takeoff (RATO) launch method for the BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target.   The goals of the alternate launch capability are to reduce life cycle costs, improve launch reliability, and reduce environmental impacts.  The alternate launch approach must be capable of launching all target configurations (clean, IR, and EA) at target weights of 1,400 to 2,050 pounds to speeds of at least 150 knots.  In certain configurations the BQM-167A is limited to a maximum of 6g in the axis that is parallel to the drone centerline. The system must be ready 24 hours prior to launch and operate in day, night, and inclement weather conditions. The launcher system must be capable of launching up to six BQM-167A targets, with the capability of selecting any of the six targets and launching up to four targets within five minutes of each other.  The system must be capable of supporting two mission periods per 24 hour period, requiring up to four targets per mission with no more than four hours between missions.  The entire launch system must be within visual range of the control facility.  At Tyndall AFB/Gulf Range the area available for creating a launching system shall be 260 ft parallel to the beach by 700 ft perpendicular to the beach.  The Tyndall AFB/Gulf Range area restrictions are expected to be the most limiting.  Operation and maintenance of the launch system must be accommodated within the current Air Force manpower resources.  Launch system shall minimize impact to existing range subscale launch infrastructure.  The Air Force has limited development funding for this acquisition.  CEi is able to meet performance and schedule requirements with limited developmental effort. The Government does not own a technical data package and/or software data rights for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.  The 53d Weapons Evaluation Group (53 WEG) will use the alternate launch capability to launch AFSAT targets for testing and evaluating air-to-air weapon systems and for evaluation/training exercises on the Eglin Gulf Range Complex and other authorized DoD ranges.
  
The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  The government has determined that the only way to prevent any adverse impact to critical mission activities that could result from a break in the continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets is to issue a follow-on contract to the incumbent vendor.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Brig Gen Michael N. Wilson, (850) 882-5422, AAC/CR and the alternate is Col Brian D. Buel (850) 882-5422, AAC/CS both located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5422.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization - Pacific has a requirement for Cisco Switches and Dell Laptops.  Cisco equipment is required for full and compatibility and integration into a research and developmental network at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, Hawaii.  Previous attempts to integrate Cisco, Nortel, Bay Networks, and Enterasys network equipment did not provide a usable network.  Interoperability issues between the listed manufacturers prevented reliable multicast and unicast traffic delivery.  The standardization of Cisco equipment is required to accommodate the varied types of experimentation performed.  Use of non-Cisco products has (based on previous tests) altered the anticipated or measured results of the experiments performed.  The equipment must be new with valid software licenses, maintenance, and warranties. Dell laptops are required for the following salient characteristics: 1) integrated RS-232 serial interface (9-pin); 2) integrated Smart Card; 3) easily removable primary hard drives (for switching between classified and unclassified networks); 4) integrated biometric fingerprint reader; 5) externally disabled (on/off switch) wireless network adapter; 6) Gigabit Ethernet interface; and 7) modular drive bay (floppy, DVD+/-RW, and secondary hard drive).  Peripherals from existing older Dell laptops will also be reutilized (docking stations, primary hard drives, modular drives, etc.).  The Dell laptops will be used for network monitoring and maintenance of classified and unclassified R&D networks at PMRF.
This procurement is a 100% Small Business set-aside.  All those interested should request a copy of the RFP by submitting an e-mail to the primary POC.

<DESC>Non-standard GEN II and III Night Vision and Thermal Image Devices <BR><BR>The intent of this announcement is to conduct a market research, this is not a solicitation. This is only an estimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any  way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.  The government is looking to establish a 5 year Multi Award Task Order for the rapid procurement of various non-standard, commercial night vision (Gen II & Gen III) and thermal ima ging devices to fulfill requirements for Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  A list of the devices that are most likely to be procured is shown below.  Due to the unsystematic demand that is characteristic of FMS, a schedule cannot be predicted.  Quantities can  range from 10  500 per order.  In-country operator and intermediate maintenance training courses may also be required to support these items.  The purpose of this market survey is to identify sources that can provide these items within a relatively short  period of time, i.e., 90 days or less from issuance of a delivery order.  Since these items are being purchased for Foreign Military Sales, the government is looking for items that are below the currently fielded US military standards.  For example, in ac cordance with Department of State regulations, Image Intensification tubes used in night vision devices are limited to Figures of Merit of 1600 or less. <BR><BR>ACOG 4X32 TA01B SCOPE <BR>AN/AVS-6 AVIATOR'S NV IMAGING SYSTEM<BR>AN/AVS-9 AVIATOR'S NV IMAGING  SYSTEM<BR>AN/PAQ-4C INFRARED AIMING LIGHT <BR>AN/PAS-13 THERMAL WEAPON SIGHT <BR>AN/PEM-1 LASER BORELIGHT SYSTEM <BR>AN/PEQ-2/2A INFRARED ILLUMINATOR<BR>AN/PEQ-6 LASER AIMING MODULE <BR>AN/PVS-10 DAY/NIGHT SNIPER SIGHT<BR>AN/PVS-14 MONOCULAR NV DEVICE <BR >AN/PVS-23 BINOCULAR NV GOGGLE<BR>AN/PVS-4 NIGHT VISION WEAPON SIGHT <BR>AN/PVS-7 NIGHT VISION GOGGLES <BR>AN/PVS-7D NIGHT VISION GOGGLES<BR>ANV-126-001 NV DEVICE TEST SET<BR>ANV-20/20 INFINITY FOCUS SYSTEM<BR>BUSHNELL ELITE 4200 RIFLE SCOPE <BR>CADET 75 T HERMAL IMAGING CAMERA <BR>LEUPOLD MARK 4 16x40MM LR/TM1 RIFLE SCOP <BR>M953 NIGHT VISION BINOCULAR <BR>M955 MINI NIGHT VISION SIGHT<BR>M963 NIGHT VISION GOGGLES <BR>M983 MONOCULAR NIGHT VISION SYSTEM <BR>MARK VII EYESAFE LASER TARGET LOCATOR<BR>MUM-14 MULT I-USE MONOCULAR <BR>MX-10160 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube <BR>MX-11769 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube<BR>MX-10130 Gen 3, 18 mm Image Intensifier Tube<BR>PURGE KIT FOR NIGHT VISION GOGGLES<BR>TAM-14 THERMAL ACQUISITION MONOCULAR <BR>TS-4348/UV N V DEVICE TEST SET<BR>WS2154 6X AQUILA WEAPON SIGHT <BR><BR><BR>Any interested sources are encouraged to provide the following information, NLT 10 March 2008, to CECOM LCMC SAMD, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-SA-IEW (Michael Bernicker), Bldg. 1208, Ft.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, in conjunction with the Dynamic Target Engagement and Enhanced Sensor Capabilities Future Naval Capability (FNC) sponsored and managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is soliciting applied research and advanced technology demonstration proposals for the development and flight demonstration of an innovative, small, efficient, heavy-fuels propulsion system suitable for small, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is anticipated that up to $8.0M over two years will be available for this solicitation, subject to appropriation and approval by ONR. The program seeks to develop and demonstrate technology for a heavy fuel propulsion system for small tactical UAVs. The propulsion system prototype should significantly improve upon current system performance suitable to a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 within 24 months. TRL 6 for this program is defined as a flight demonstration of the propulsion system prototype in a representative unmanned aerial vehicle. The propulsion system developed shall be suitable for flight testing on a small UAV to be determined and supplied by the government team at a later date. It is the intent of the government team to provide the aircraft and integration requirements prior to the invitation to submit full proposals. The final configuration shall be technically suitable for transition into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program acquisition phase. The propulsion system shall be defined as all the components, sub-components, and auxiliary equipment necessary to operate the engine except for electrical power conditioning equipment, the fuel, fuel supply reservoir, fuel tubing from the reservoir to the fuel pump or fuel manifold, and fuel tank heater. Individual technologies may address such technical areas as combustion, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics; fuel delivery and atomization; intake and exhaust systems; fluid dynamics; advanced materials and structures; thermal management systems; power generation systems; mechanical systems; controls, accessories and engine health management systems; drive train and gearbox; and propellers. The use of integrated electrical power generation design features is highly encouraged. Specifics of the engine configuration, such as if it is required to be a pusher or puller, will be provided prior to the start of development with the determination of the flight demonstration vehicl!  e. Materials characterization, tailoring, processing, and behavior may be included in this effort to the extent that it is related to the development of advanced engine components or issues associated with durability and shipboard suitability. The desired technical effort should consist of one or more advanced technology component development tasks that may include conceptual, preliminary, and detailed design, fabrication, assembly, instrumentation, component rig or bench testing, engine demonstrator testing on both the ground and in flight, data analysis, and reporting. It is likely that individual offerors will not have the complete skills to successfully execute the program in its entirety. Therefore, business-to-business or business-to-academia coordination or partnerships are highly encouraged to improve analysis, design, and testing capabilities as well as pre-production design and planning. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.

Under this program, USAID/Colombia is assisting civil society organizations and government entities to implement a wide array of activities designed to promote respect for human rights and protect individuals and communities from human rights abuses.  USAID anticipates awarding a short-term cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract to evaluate progress, as well as the sustainability and impact of the program's interventions.  The results of the independent evaluation will contribute to USAID's decision about exercising the option years.

The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.

<DESC>The US Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Peru intends to seek proposals from qualified U.S. and local organizations interested in providing services to strengthen counternarcotics policies and related institutions in Peru.  The activity will work to create a critical mass of public and civil society actors who are well-informed on counternarcotics-related issues and who can help advance policy that furthers GOP and USG objectives of controlling illicit coca and promoting integrated licit development in coca growing regions.  The objectives will be achieved through three primary areas of intervention:

a) Build a core critical mass of public and civil society leaders (in Lima and in regions) able to engage meaningfully in counternarcotics policy formulations and debates.

b) Provide technical assistance to key Ministries, members of Congress, and other government actors on policy formulation.

c) Strengthen DEVIDA so that it can successfully perform its role in coordinating counternarcotics policies and programs.

USAID plans to award a Cost Plus Fixed Feed (CPFF) completion-type contract covering a total estimated period of four years: A three (3) year base period and (1) one-year option period.

Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of a best value determination for contract award, including cost effective approaches to achieving the results.

This is a full and open competition, under which any type of U.S. or local organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 

Offerors are advised that funds are not yet available for award at this time and that contract award is also subject to the approval of Mission Operational Plans. This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred  in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package that will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about March 12, 2008. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $12.5M.  

The purpose of this procurement, for the proposed study, is to search for P53 mutation signatures of PAH exposure in tumor and non-neoplastic esophageal tissues from ESCC cases and non-neoplastic esophageal tissues from controls, and to evaluate the association between these signatures and case status.  The case and control subjects in this study shall be from Golestan Province, which is the high-risk area of Iran for ESCC.  

IARC is the only major research institution conducting a case-control study of esophageal cancer at the western end of the Central Asian Esophageal Cancer Belt, and is therefore the only known source for data and biological samples from this area.  IARC has a long history of quality research activities, including research in this geographic area of Iran.  The comparison of results from this and other high risk areas, which are very different geographically, culturally and ethnically, will be a valuable resource for identifying etiologic risk factors for this disease that are important throughout the world. 

The contractor shall: 1) Stain tumor microarrays (TMAs) made from esophageal tumors and non-neoplastic esophageal tissue for PAH-DNA adducts using the 5D11 antibody; 2)  Stain the same TMAs for p53 protein expression using a panel of four antibodies (DO7, PAb1801, CM1, and anti-phospho15); 3)  Sequence the P53 gene in adduct-positive and adduct-negative tissues from ESCC case and control subjects and; 4)  Examine the association between P53 gene mutations, p53 protein expression, the presence of PAH-DNA adducts, and case status.   The contractor shall do the above-mentioned analyses on four alcohol-fixed microarrays obtained from ESCC cases and  matched controls enrolled in the case-control study recently conducted in the high-risk areas of northeastern Iran.  Contractor shall prepare a report and submit to the NCI project officer at the end of the period of performance.

The Period of Performance shall be for six (6) months from date of award.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 am ET on March 11, 2008 to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors? responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email the aforementioned individual to insure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov.

The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor?s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP toner cartridges.  The use of a brand name description is essential to INR's requirements, for all INR networks and printing capabilities , thereby precluding consideration fo the products of another company.  INR/EX/IS has identified the HP toner cartridges as a key component of INR's printing capabilities. Equipment listed in the PR is required to provide printing from the network printers on the existing INR systems.  The HP toner cartridges are the only toner cartridges that reproduce the colors correctly and will not damage the printers. The 41 USC 253 (c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet INR's printing requirements as a key component of INR's systems.<BR><BR>Reposted to correct part number in line 3.<BR><BR>

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware. It is needed in support of MDAs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agencys mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats. Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system. Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology. IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet  a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test. No other software exists that affords the capability. Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture. Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencys requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programs mission.<BR><BR>

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to  Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO)  Training Capability This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that  may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the  requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an  on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States  Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data.  The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in  this requirement has not been determined.  Contractors/Institutions  responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation  in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or  contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any  expenses associated with their participation in this survey. INSTRUCTIONS: 1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a  Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys  capability. 2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the  market research, you should provide documentation that supports your  companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide  documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately  assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a  particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome  the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of  the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.) 3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this  Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged. 4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John  Webb at (937) 904-4254. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION T-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:            We are conducting market research to identify potential sources  that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the  requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems  Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data.  The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System  Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based  training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global  positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar  Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position  with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and  instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator  for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar  capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to  three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part  of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval  Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training  System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified  aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010  with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability  (FOC) in 2011. 	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the  aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical /  engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified  as integrated into the T-1 aircraft. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY T-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability Part I.

	1.  BGSE Software (All Revisions)
 
The IIR contract incorporated by reference DFARS 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (OCT 1988)(DAC 88-2).  That clause defines the terms Limited Rights and Restricted Rights as follows:

(15)Limited Rights means rights to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, by or for the Government, with the express limitation that such technical data shall not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, be: released or disclosed outside the Government; used by the Government for manufacture, or in the case of computer software documentation, for preparing the same or similar computer software; or used by a party other than the Government, except that the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if ?
	i.  such release, disclosure, or use?
		a.  is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
		b.  is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational purposes;
	ii.  such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose or use such data; and
	iii.  the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.

(17)Restricted rights means rights that apply only to computer software, and include, as a minimum, the right to?
	i.  Use computer software with the computer for which or with which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computer may be transferred by the Government; 
	ii.  Use computer software with a backup computer if the computer for which or with which it was acquired is inoperative;
	iii.  Copy computer programs for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes; and
	iv.  Modify computer software, or combine it with other software, subject to the provision that those portions of the derivative software incorporating restricted rights software are subject to the same restricted rights. 
In addition, restricted rights include any other specific rights not inconsistent with the minimum rights in (a)(17)(i)-(iv) above that are listed or described in the contract or described in a license agreement made a part of the contract.

3) Q: Is the work solely related to the 2R satellites?

A: This is related to the IIR and IIR-M satellites.

4) Q: How does this work differ from that being performed by the OSSS/NSOM contractor for the GPS mod at Schriever AFB?

A: The only OSSS/NSOM work related to the IIR satellite sustainment is in the area of Orbital Analysis (OAs).  All other support is provided by the SV manufacturer at this time.  To clarify, the OSSS/NSOM contractor provides direct support for the 2/19 SOPS crews that operate the satellite.

A9.	No.  We have provided the opportunity to all small business entities through a sources sought that was released on January 2006.  It was determined that there are no other small business entities that can provide this effort to the extent that is necessary.

Q12.	Will the RFP response be submitted electronically?
A12.	It has not been determined yet if the RFP responses will be accepted electronically.

Q13.	Does the Presolicitation Notice replace the Sources Sought Notice that was released on January 9, 2006 "N00421-06-R-0027 - NAVAIR IT/IM Services?
A13.	No, however, this solicitation is a result of the N00421-06-R-0027 Sources Sought Notice.

Q14.	 I just saw the announcement for this opportunity on Fedbizopps and just wanted to clarify that this was a different requirement than the NAVAIR IT IM (N0042106R0027).  
A14.	Yes, they are different requirements as addressed in Q1 & A1.

Q15.	Still a little confused as N0042106R0027 is also advertised on Fedbizopps as a Total Small Business set aside.  Are both these requirements going to be Small business set asides? 
A15.	When N00421-06-R-0027 was on Fedbizopps previously it was for Sources Sought information.  The sources sought was used to give Small Business Administration (SBA) a fair opportunity to provide their capability statement to determine if Small Business could rationally provide the services.  The outcome determined that these areas as identified in N00421-06-R-0057 would be earmarked and set aside for Small Businesses.

<SOLNBR>N6258308R0040
<CONTACT>June Haynes, 805-982-5095.
<DESC>The Specialty Center Acquisitions NAVFC intends to negotiate a bridge contract, on a sole source basis, to the incumbent contractor, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), CA. This purchase will be under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under the authority of U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Computer Sciences Corporation will continue to provide Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) that includes but is not limited to acquisition of Commercial Off-The-Shelf Technical Manuals, development of Allowance Parts Lists, development of Allowance Equipage Lists, development of Technical Documents such as User Logistics Support Plans, technical Support on-site at NFELC; and providing logistics assistance and review of ILS documentation as part of the overall logistics support package for equipment procured for NECC units deployed in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), including the Mine Resistant Amb!  ush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles, and required for policy and process development as part of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Enterprise (NECE) Cross-Functional-Team (CFT 3) working groups. Absence of proper ILS support for deployed equipment makes proper use, maintenance and repairs of CESE significantly more difficult and time-consuming, and may contribute to the loss of the CESE well short of its useful life. Any delay in providing this ILS support can delay the deployment of this vital equipment to Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) and the Naval Construction Force (NCF/Seabees) field units in combat areas. To remove barriers from competition in the future, we anticipate soliciting the follow on contact for ILS support services on a competitive basis no later than nine months from the award of this bridge contract, 1 March 2008. The bridge contract will be a Not to Exceed (NTE) nine (9) month, Time and Materials contract in the estimated ceiling amount of $5,0!  00,000. This contract is intended to bridge the period between the end  of the existing contract which expires on 28 February 2008 and a new competitive award to be in place within nine (9) months or sooner. This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations. No solicitation document exists. No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.

NAICS Code = 541710 Place of Performance = N/A Set Aside Default is N/Arequirement is for the aircraft to be able to fly, and the minimum airspeed will be specified in the Interface Control Document. 21.	Q:	What is the required thrust? 	A:	None is specified, but if you develop the required horsepower to keep it in the air, that will be sufficient. 22.	Q:	After the white papers are submitted by 16 April, when will you send out invitations for a full proposal? 	A:	The goal is to send a letter of response within 7 days. This time could be longer depending on the number of white papers received for evaluation.  If an e-mail address is provided, the response will be sent by e-mail. 23.	Q:	Phase I and II will be cost plus fixed fee?  	A:	The entire contract will be cost plus fixed fee. You need to cost each phase separately, but all phases will be evaluated together as a whole. 24.	Q:	The white paper is limited to 15 pages. Does that include text, pictures, graphs, and tables, or just text? 	A:	That includes everything, so don't overpopulate with pictures. Text is important. The table of contents and any resumes will not be counted in the 15 pages. 25.	Q:	Will a list of Industry Day attendees be provided on FEDBIZOPS?   	A:	Yes. This listing is enclosed as an attachment to this amendment notice.  26.	Q:	Does the cost in the white paper have to be our final cost? 	A:	No. It can be a rough order-of-magnitude estimate. 27.	Q:	Will you accept the white paper as an e-mail? 	A:	The BAA specifies it must be a hardcopy. 28.	Q:	Since taxes are not due until 17 April, is 16 April a Federal holiday?   		A:	No 29.	Q:	The electrical power generated must be .75 kw. Do you care what frequency? 	A:	No. 30.	Q:	In the BAA 1.4.1.2, number 11, lists parts as A-F, then were asked to provide as "1-6." 	A:	That was a typographical error that didn't get corrected. The alphas should correlate to the numerical listing. (i.e.: A=1, B=2, etc). 31.	Q:	Does "producibility" mean you're looking for a full-production manufacturing plan? A:	No. We're looking to see if you've thought through the issues to produce the product and manufacture the engine in a reasonable way and how that will take place.  We ask that you have an idea of how the engine will be produced. 32.	Q:	You're not looking for an explanation of how it can be produced somewhere else? 	A:	We're not asking for that kind of detail. 33. Q: Do you want the cost associated with production factored in to our cost proposal? 	A:	This is not a requirement. We do not have a producibility cost goal. We will want a rough order-of-magnitude cost estimate in your producibility plan using a baseline of 200 engines. 34.	Q:	In Phase III you will want a deliverable. Do you have an idea of the number of engines? 	A:	At least one engine. 35.	Q:	Are you looking for onboard starting? 	A:	No, just an external method. 36.	Q:	How do you see this program relating to the Class 1 and Class 2 UAVs for the Army? 	A:	I can't speak to Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) nor guarantee similarities.  37.	Q:	Considering the different fuels in the goals, should all of them be considered as prime fuels? 	A:	The guidance we have says the warfighter wants all three. 38.	Q:	Are there cold-weather specifications for diesel fuel?   	A:	You are permitted to warm the fuels to the extent that it is reasonable that the expected airframe could accommodate such a feature. 39.	Q:	What is the start-up time? 	A:	Start-up time has not been specified.  40.	Q:	Subsystems and full systems will be tested at government facilities. Can you explain why subsystems would need to be tested by the government? 	A:	This may not be necessary, but we need to reserve the right to test subsystems.  41.	Q:	Do we need to include the cost of this testing in our cost budget? 	A:	The government will cover the facility and government personnel costs.  You will need to budget for your personnel and any other costs. 42. Q:	Should we include cost estimates for UAV integration? 	A	Yes, you should budget some. 43.	Q:	There is a noise signature qualification for 1500 ft AGL. Is there a dB specified? 	A:	No MIL-STDs or MIL-HDBKs exist to describe the quantification of the acoustic observability of aircraft.  A primer with pertinent references will be provided as soon as possible. 44.	Q: Is the noise requirement while running at 5 horsepower? 	A:	Yes. 45.	Q:	We will be working with subcontractors on this. Many of them consider their information highly proprietary.  Can we assure them that it will be well-protected? 	A:	Yes. Our technical evaluation team have all signed certificates of non-disclosures. Primes are required to evaluate their subcontractors to ensure that their price is fair and reasonable. Subcontractors can submit their cost information to support the proposal directly to Debra Zamarron, Contracts Specialist, separate from the Prime's package. The subcontractor proposals must be received by the proposal due date of 4 June 2007 by 2:00 PST. The prime contractor is responsible for ensuring the proposals are received by the due date and time.  46.	Q:	Are there any targets for per-hour run cost; any existing system data? 	  A:	We do not currently have cost goals.  We will find some baselines and provide them as soon as possible. 47.	Q:	Do we know which fuel will run in the vehicle? 	A:	Ground tests will run all three. One will be chosen for the flight test. You will be able to perform minimal changes to the engines to run the different fuels. We will be looking for the least amount of changes required for operators to use the different fuels. 48.	Q:	What are you looking for in the "complete test and validation" plan? 	A:	The plan should explain how you will identify and mitigate risks and show how the system will meet the aim, goals, and objectives of the program. 49.	Q:	What are our data rights? 	A:	If you use some things that you have already developed, those will remain yours. You should complete DFARS Clause 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Non-Commercial Items, and include it with your written proposal. 50.	Q:	Can we continue to develop core technologies at our own expense? 	A:	If you do, it will have to be handled very carefully. The government must get a return on its investment, so you must be careful to keep your IRAD money separate from the governments. 51.	Q:	Will engines be subjected to dyno tests or propeller tests? 	A:	Dyno with brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC).  52.	Q:	Is there a list or MIL SPEC on sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials that can be used?  	A:	There are guidelines and they will be provided as soon as possible. 53.	Q:	Do you know the test location for the dyno testing? 	A:	No, but we are working on that. 56.	Q:	Do we need to understand how to get flight clearance? 	A:	No. NAVAIR will require a flight clearance and the program will help with that. 57.	Q:	In the early part of the development we may have components that are not made of sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials that would not be in the final engine. 	A:	Phase III deliverable engines must meet the sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials requirement. 58.	Q:	Will the government help us find sources of JP-8 and JP-5? That can be hard to find. 	A: Yes, we'll assist with that. The diesel fuel is Number 2. NAICS Code = 541710 Place of Performance = N/A Set Aside  = N/A

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to distribute the Questions and Answers which were discussed at Industry Day held at China Lake, CA on 20 March 2007. Also enclosed as an attachment to this notice is the Attendees Listing.  Ultra Endurance UAV Heavy-Fuel Engine Development Industry Day - 20 March 2007 N68936-07-R-0020 - Ultra Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UE-UAV) Questions and Answers  1.	Q: 	There seems to be some confusion in the response date for the white paper. It's currently posted as 23 April, but the brief says 16 April. Which is correct?  	A:	The correct date is 16 April.  23 April was a typographical error. See Table 5.1  Significant Dates and Times, in the original synopsis. This date was also corrected in amendment 1 to the synopsis dated 7 March 2007. 2.	Q:	Why is the tolerance on AC power set at .75 kw. If we could generate more, would that be acceptable. 	A:	Yes, you can produce more, but the requirement is for .75 kw, while also producing 5 horsepower at the propeller shaft. 3.	Q:	Also, shouldn't that be a minimum of 9 horse power? Youd accept something higher, right? 	A:	Yes. At full power the engine must produce a minimum of 8.5 (nominal 9 SHP) propeller-shaft horsepower. 4.	Q: 	Are the dwell time figures based on MSL standard? 	A:	There are no dwell time requirements. However, performance parameters will be corrected to Sea Level. 5.	Q:	I assume the ideal engine would propel the airframe to 15,000 to 16,000 feet altitude. 	A:	The objective is 15,000 feet. 6.	Q:	What is included in the propulsion system? 	A:	This information is specified in the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). 7.	Q:	You're looking for speeds of 2500 to 5000 RPM? 	A:	The BAA suggests an RPM range. We're really looking for a typical RPM range at 5 propeller-shaft horsepower?   8.	Q:	Why do you specify AC power? 	A:	That's what we felt would be best. But were willing to listen if you think DC power would be better. Just be sure to make the point and back it up in your white paper. 9.	Q:	Will the AC power be conditioned to something else? 	A:	Yes, by the aircraft. 10.	Q:	 The AC power generation components must be included in the total engine weight? 	A:	Yes. 11.	Q:	Will differences be considered in the white paper.  For example, does the engine have to be the weight specified or if a heavier engine is proposed that will fly longer, can that be considered? 	A:	Yes, if it is reasonably similar and the efficiency is increased. 12.	Q:	The pusher propeller is the most likely? 	A: 	Most likely. 13.	Q:	What is the propeller size and RPM of the existing Aerolight aircraft? 	A:	Two-blade, 22" propeller at 3600-7000 RPM. The propeller can be 2- or 3-blade and the RPM can vary. 14.	Q:	If we are testing in the 2500 to 5000 RPM range, we may need larger propellers to move air. 	A:	The performance specifications will be validated during ground testing. If a propeller change is required for aircraft integration, this is allowed as long as it provides sufficient thrust for flight. 15.	Q:	Will airframes be available for form, fit, and function checks? 	A:	Yes, some access will be provided later in the program.  16.	Q:	What is the current engine in the Aerolight? 	A:	It is the Q100M from Quadra Aerrow.  With the generator, it weights 12 lbs. 17.	Q:	Are these commercially available airframes? 	A:	Yes. These are manufactured by Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd (Isreali). There is more information available on the web (see URL below). The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and Shephard have database information.   http://www.aeronautics-sys.com/Index.asp?CategoryID=62&ArticleID=34&Page=1 18.	Q:	If we have a representative aircraft that demonstrates the capabilities of our engine, can we use it and accelerate the program? 	A:	Yes, if it is close, we will take a look at it.  19.	Q:	You say both of these airframes are at Webster Field? 	A:	Yes. Webster Field is near Patuxent River, MD.  20.	Q:	What is required cruising speed? 	A:	The

<SUBJECT>R -- Intermodal Security Training Exercise Program (I-STEP) Sources Sought Notice
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HSTS02-08-ISTEPSS
<RESPDATE>022908

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Intermodal Security Training Exercise Program (I-STEP) under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Transportation Security Network Management (TSNM).  

BACKGROUND

The mission of the TSNM administration is to protect the Nations transportation systems and its users by collaborating with transportation sectors to identify and mitigate transportation security risks. The mission includes mitigating the risk of all terrorist disruption to transportation systems, including waterway, rail, highways, mass transit and pipelines. The TSNM administration is responsible for the security of passengers, cargo and infrastructure.

The desired outcome of the I-STEP is for the transportation security industry to increase their level of preparedness to prevent, respond to and recover from a terrorist or transportation security incident. A transportation security incident (TSI) can result in loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, and/or economic disruption in a particular area. This can be accomplished by conducting exercises, evaluating and correcting contingency plans, and having transportation security personnel interact with federal, state, and local agencies to learn about one anothers organizations, assets, plans and abilities in order to prevent, respond and recover from a terrorist or security incident.  

Exercises should identify areas for improvements, disconnects and gaps in the security plans and evaluating contingency plans, so they can be used to formulate corrective actions and foster interagency communication. Information about the efforts used to formulate corrective action and to foster interagency communication should be collected and analyzed so that program managers can gain insight to best practices, shortcomings, and improvement opportunities.  Technology should be employed to enhance exercise impact and realism, facilitate record keeping and data/trends analysis, increase the availability of information, and boost stakeholder communication and collaboration.

I-STEPs primary objective is to design, develop, implement, and evaluate security training exercises for use by the intermodal transportation system operators, e.g. Freight Rail, Mass Transit, and Highway modes and area maritime transportation security community, to continuously improve security plans and operations readiness to prevent, respond to, and recover from a TSI. 


OBJECTIVES

<DESC>Questions and Answers: RFP VA-262-08-RP-0126 The following questions were submitted regarding RFP VA-262-08-RP-0126. Clarification to these questions are provided in RED. 1. There are two phases in this project where outside approval is required (1.  Approval of the Scoping Document and 2.  Approval of the final report).  How long will the Government have for review as this will impact the overall schedule? We will give the County and the NHPP 3 days on the scope and 1 week for the final report, the county will not see the final report till VA releases it.  The NHPP will be the only Agency type to review the final report. 2. On page 6 of the Solicitation, we are asked to provide costs as LUMP SUM by Task.  On page 15 we are asked to provide detailed costs for the project.  What would you like to see in regard to costing? The Contractor is to provide all-inclusive costs per task on page 6-Description of Schedule of Services.  The cost estimate required on page 15, shall be deleted from the solicitation in its entirety. 3. Does the statement in the RFP under (1) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY g., page 36, last sentence in regards to CHP qualifications, require the qualified individual to have experience as an NRC inspector or does it intend that the qualified person have experience with direct involvement in NRC audits, inspections, and compliance (as, for example, an NRC licensee radiation safety officer or as a consultant to a licensee for such audits, inspections, or compliance activities?"  The CHP does not have to have experience as a NRC inspector just experience with NRC inspections and compliance. 4. What regulatory agency will be involved for and approving reviewing the workplan, reports and risk analysis report?              - LA County Solid Waste Division - Department of Public Health         - National Health Physics Program (NHPP) - Veterans Health Administration 5.  There will be numerous documents/reports required that will have to be reviewed and approved by the governing agency prior to start of the following task (Initial Scoping   Document,Work Plan/Survey Design, Site Investigation Report, IDW Characterization and Disposal Report, and Risk Assessment). What is the anticipated turn-around time for draft document technical review and comments? Extensive review time that is beyond our control will cut in to the tight time schedule to complete the project.     2 weeks, everything must be completed within 120 days  6.  If the turn-around time for review and approval of the work plan and draft reports extend beyond one week each, it may hinder completing the work in the required time schedule. Will extension of deadlines be approved under circumstances beyond our control?    Yes  7.  Who is the GLAHS IDW disposal contractor?   Industrial Waste is Waste Management, hazardous waste in North State Environmental  8.  How do we obtain VA I.D> badges for all personnel?  Badges will be provided at time of award.   9. What specific radiological analytes/isotopes are anticipated to be encountered are anticipated for the soil and groundwater samples?   There are many over 20 different isotopes which are outlined in the previous reports of the site    10. The solicitation document states that  "The proposal shall be prepared in written format, and will be accepted via regular mail by 12:00 pm PST on the day the proposal is due." Can the proposal be hand delivered?  Yes   11. Page 15 of RFP, Item 5, states that travel expenses shall be included in the detailed cost estimate.  Yet on pg. 16, item 8, it states that transportation for Contractor's personnel shall not be billed or paid under the resulting contract.  How will the travel expenses be dealt with?  The cost estimate portion of the solicitation shall be deleted from the solicitation in its entirety. The Government shall not be responsible for travel/mileage expenses. All costs shall be all-inclusive and indicated on page 6-Description of Schedule of Services.  12. Are any sensitive species or habitat anticipated to be encountered during investigation in the canyon area?       No 13. Is the site currently under a license for radioactive materials?            No 14. Are the 2 VA burial sites under license for radioactive material?    None have a license 15. Is there a minimum number of groundwater monitoring wells required?   Would be based on your risk assessment 16. Does the VA know whether the fluids were removed from the scintillation vials prior to disposal?   No they were not 17. The requirement for a soil gas survey was not stipulated in the solicitation document. Although there are no future buildings planned in the investigated area, a soil vapor survey is generally necessary for the risk assessment in order to have a concept on what is migrating up through the soil. Will a soil gas survey be required?       No

Description
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to contract for services for the requirement entitled Traumatic Brain Injury Resource and Technical Assistance Center.


This requirement is intended to implement a Resource and Technical Assistance Center that will serve all grantees, both current and former, of the Federal Traumatic Brain Injury Program, as well as providing a source of general information on TBI for those members of the public interested in or affected by TBI. 
Traumatic Brain Injury affects more than 5.3 million Americans, and it has become the ?signature injury? of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  This translates, for many families, into a lifelong need for services and supports, just to meet the needs of daily living for the brain-injured individual.  At the same time, families and individuals face serious challenges such as improper or inadequate diagnosis and post-acute treatment; inability to advocate for and receive proper rehabilitation services; institutional segregation; unemployment, financial hardship, and an increased susceptibility to substance abuse and repeated brain injury.
The Federal Traumatic Brain Injury Program seeks to help individuals succeed in their recovery and rehabilitation from TBI by assisting states to develop systems of care that are accessible, connected, affordable, and community-based. The program further provides assistance to States to ensure that the rights of individuals with a TBI are protected, and that they receive advocacy services where needed. To this end, the program awards grants in two categories:  State Infrastructure (Partnership) Grants, and Protection and Advocacy Grants.
Grantees from these programs require an ongoing source of information and assistance with resource development, with sustainability issues, with current information on legislation and other forces affecting the TBI community, with education on promising and best practices, and with the opportunity to learn from their peers through information and product sharing; through an interactive list serve, and through a computer based system that provides easy access for searches relating to TBI, its treatment and characteristics.  In addition, the grantees benefit from distance education efforts such as webcasts and from peer learning opportunities such as regional and national meetings.  Similarly, the federal TBI program staff requires assistance in planning and implementing activities that will inform and benefit grantees and will, in general, assist with ensuring high quality customer service to our grantees, which then can translate into our ultimate goal of helping to meet the needs of individuals with TBI.
Specifically, this contractor will assist the Federal TBI Program and its grantees in the following areas:
1.	Meeting grantees? informational needs through targeted technical assistance; resource facilitation; resource development and collection; accumulation of promising and best practices; and the use of a variety of media to address specific information needs. 
2.	Dissemination of materials developed by the Resource Center and by grantees, through various means, including mailings, conference calls, and webcasts. 
3.	Provide support to HRSA?s Federal TBI Program staff through logistical and informational services.
4.	Maintain an awareness of public policy around TBI and a means of disseminating this information to the grantees.
5.	Establish a means of discerning grantee information and training needs and priorities and, in concert with HRSA, a mechanism for responding in a timely fashion.
Contractor will be required to produce the following deliverables:
1.	An infrastructure that supports grantees through maintenance of the following methods of sharing information: databases for collecting information and for tracking technical assistance; an interactive listserv; a website for grantees and a website for the public; a method for disseminating products; a capacity to assess and meet grantee training needs; reference services; identification of funding opportunities for grantees as well as resource availability; and product review and development.
2.	Technical Assistance to Grantees and the HRSA Federal TBI Program, including telephone and in-person consultation as is needed and feasible. 
3.	Outreach activities that support the interests of the Federal TBI Program and its grantees.
4.	Quarterly progress reports containing information on services provided under the contract
Qualified contractors must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your company?s experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:  
1.	Demonstrated familiarity with the issues surrounding traumatic brain injury, including an awareness of the history and scope of legislation affecting the TBI community, rehabilitation, employment, transportation and housing concerns; and a knowledge of how state government and its agencies work..
2.	Experience in the field of in the field of public health with a focus on areas of maternal and child health concern, specifically a knowledge of issues affecting individuals with special health care needs and their families.
3.	Demonstrated ability to work with grantees in a manner which supports the goals of HRSA?s Federal TBI Program.

The Government anticipates award of a non-commercial, definite quantity, fixed price type contract. The procurement is anticipated to be a base year with four (4) one-year option periods.  The incumbent contractor is Judy Campbell Bird of Chevy Chase, MD. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 and the size standard is $6.5M.

Description

Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.     
Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization Systems (PARCS).
The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 Apr 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for a geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the PARCS field station located at Cavalier AFS North Dakota. The PARCS provides 24-hour per-day missile warning and space surveillance coverage.  Detects, tracks and reports via data link, real-time earth-impacting objects to the Missile Warning Center or its alternate.  Provides, via data link, real-time metric observations and Space Object Identification (SOI) on tasked earth-orbiting objects to the Space Control Center, or its alternate, and the 1st Space Control Squadron (1SPCS). The PARCS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008). The Government anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years. Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm-Fixed Price with Performance Incentives and a cost-reimbursable logistics CLIN. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.     The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  
                           
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause)

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION T-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:            We are conducting market research to identify potential sources  that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the  requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems  Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data.  The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System  Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based  training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global  positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar  Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position  with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and  instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator  for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar  capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to  three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part  of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval  Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training  System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified  aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010  with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability  (FOC) in 2011. 	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the  aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical /  engineering data on the aircraft.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University Corporation of Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) for participation fees for the Abilene network.

***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for WAN connectivity to both the commodity Internet and the Next Generation Internet (NGI, Internet2 or I2). Internet2 is a consortium of over 170 universities working in partnership with industry and government to develop and deploy advanced network applications and technologies, accelerating the creation of the future commodity Internet. Internet2 has built an advanced backbone network known as Abilene that connects regional network aggregation points, called GigaPOPs. Only research related traffic is permitted on the Abilene network. Abilene and Internet2 are projects of UCAID and therefore is the only source of this service. 

***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>NASA/KSC is hereby soliciting capabilities information from certified 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns for the encapsulation of approximately 2.2 miles of the existing NASA Causeway Seawall within a waterward armored rock revetment and a landward armored rock splash apron. The purpose of this request is to determine the appropriate level of competition in accordance with FAR 19.10, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement as an 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSB set-aside. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $31 million. The total estimated cost of this project is in the estimated construction contract price range of between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. DESCRIPTION: In support of NASA/KSC, the firm shall provide the necessary resources to encapsulate approximately 2.2 miles of the existing NASA Causeway Seawall within a waterward armored rock revetment and a landward armored rock splash apron along with processing, transporting, and placement of approximately 55,000 tons of riprap material including granite and crushed concrete into the revetment.

The selected contractor will also need to have construction experience in marine environments, including the waterward placement of stone by landbased equipment, at a distance of 25+ feet from the shoreline. The waterway around the causeway is considered an FDEP Class 2 Shellfish Harvesting area, and numerous dolphins and manatees are spotted in the areas; therefore, appropriate precautions must be taken when working in these areas. In addition, there will be one priced option for the removal of vegetation to include Non-Native Vegetation and Brazilian Pepper Trees. Tree removal shall include the corresponding root systems. The estimated period of performance for this effort is 329 calendar days.

The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the TRBO via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  However, the Government reserves the right to invoke evaluations in an inpatient setting.

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 3.75 is a target acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Vendors must provide a response to each criteria listed below:

1. Vendors are required to provide a full line of a full line of Pulse Oximeter Sensors for adult, pediatric, and neonate patient populations. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
2. Vendor?s Pulse Oximeter Sensors must be available through the regional Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor. Companies that do not have a distribution contract/agreement with the Prime Vendor will be eliminated from further consideration.
3. Vendors are required to provide their DAPA Number. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified from further consideration. 
4. Vendors must offer discounts from the DAPA pricing for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent discounts off the DAPA.  
5. Vendors must identify if products are latex free/safe and labeled appropriately
6. Vendors are required to provide the brands their company manufactures and/or distributes.
7. Vendors are required to provide a list of styles and sizes for the products their company offers.

Instruments need to be appropriate for allied health careers as well as careers in nursing. Vendor must demonstrate the ethnic and gender analysis process used and it's outcomes for the assessment instruments.  (3)	The selected vendor must provide intervention strategies which the employee can easily access and is available to geographically diverse sites.  (4)	The selected vendor must provide VA formative and summative reports of product usage by VA employees, outcome trends, and summary of interventions with outcomes.

Developing a suggested matrix of these items for each signature area such as radar and infrared along with a rationale for choosing the particular set and attempt to obtain a tri-service consensus for the chosen set.
(2) Joint review of calibration standards and the use of such standards to ensure calibration traceability. Documenting the availability of the various standards and the various methodologies using these standards in the calibration chain.  Adopting and documenting common traceable calibration methodologies for the various signature areas.
(3) Joint review of signature measurement methodologies, data reduction procedures (including correction of measured data to obtain actual target signature data), signature data presentation formats, and description of signature data and ancillary data submitted to data bases for archiving. Recommending and documenting common signature measurement methodologies for the various signature areas.
(4) Joint review of signature data bases including input formats and methodology, methods of data storage, methods for location and identification of desired data, formats for data output, and current levels of commonality between the various data bases.  Establishing RCC standards for signature data format and content of data being delivered to data bases.

<SUBJECT>R -- SETA3 Contract Extensions
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to extend System Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) Services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), on a sole source basis with Project Performance Corporation (PPC) Contract 50PAPT201026, and General Dynamics, Contract 50PAPT201006 for a period of 6 months.  The contracts are cost-plus-award fee.  The USPTO has a continuing requirement for independent, objective, and expert technical advice and assistance for ongoing and future information technology initiatives.  This requirement provides:  System Design, Infrastructure Engineering, Network Engineering, Security Engineering, Certification and Accreditation, System Engineering, Accessibility Engineering, Enterprise Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture, and System Development Life Cycle Support.  
 
The USPTO is in the process of conducting a competitive acquisition to fulfill further requirements.  The Request for Proposal for this requirement will be entitled as: Infrastructure, Design, Engineering, Architecture, and Integration (IDEAI)and is expected to be released by March 2008.  It has been determined that to conduct a competitive acquisition for these existing SETA services for a six month extension would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered as a result of the competition.  The USPTO's extension of the SETA contracts are to cover the period of performance from April 1, 2008 through September 2008 to allow sufficient time in the acquisition process.  The USPTO has determined that in accordance 41 U.S.C. 253(c ) (1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  It is noted that the USPTO is exempt from the requirement to meet the test of "full and open competition" as defined in FAR Part 6 but does endeavor to acquire products and services to the maximum extent possible in all acquisitions on a competitive basis. An uninterrupted continuation of the critical support services currently being performed by PPC and General Dynamics is required to avoid seriously undermining and delaying the attainment of critical program objectives described in the USPTO's Strategic Plan.   

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; nor will a solicitation be issued.  The USPTO will extend the SETA contracts after 15 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis without further notice.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov,  or Hope Smith at Hope.Smith@uspto.gov.  Telephone questions or inquires will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>F -- Bryologist Services
<DESC>The Superior National Forest is requesting information from contractors interested in performing searches for the rare liverworts Frullania selwyniana and Trichocolea tomentella.  Information collected will be used to determine possible sources for future contracts.  To be considered for future solicitations, please provide information as requested in Evaluation Criteria, below, by March 10, 2008.

Bryologist services for rare bryophyte survey on Superior National Forest

Project description:  The goal of the project is to search for new occurrences of the rare liverworts Frullania selwyniana and Trichocolea tomentella on the Superior National Forest (SNF).  The Superior would provide the contractor with stand information on 20 cedar stands scattered across the SNF.  The contractor would search up to 20 stands for either one of these liverworts.  Surveys would stop once 10 new stands containing either species were documented.  If less than 10 new occurrences are found, surveys would continue until all 20 stands have been examined.  

When new occurrences of either species are found, the following detailed plot data would be recorded.  For Frullania selwyniana, all bryophyte species would be identified and recorded as well as ocular estimates of cover for all bryophyte species in a 0.5 m high strip around the entire tree bole.  For Trichocolea tomentella, all bryophyte species would be identified and recorded as well as ocular estimates of cover for all bryophyte species in a 50cm x 50cm quadrat around the patch of Trichocolea tomentella.  Other environmental parameters that would be recorded at each positive detection site would include water chemistry (conductivity, pH, and absorbance) and shade.  Bryophytes must be identified to genus and species.  For each positive detection site, a GPS point (in UTM NAD 83) would be recorded and a digital photo taken.

Evaluation Criteria

<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial items to be acquired under FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any amendments or other pertinent information. This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-23 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Change Notice (DCN) 20080124. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein. This procurement is being issued as a Total Small Business set aside. The applicable NAICS code is 334119 with associated size standard of 1000 employees.

The contractor shall provide the following items on a firm fixed price basis:  

Item 1: Broadband SPDT Switch
Qty: 6
Micronetics ES0311-20 
Description: Medium power broadband SPDT switch, 20 Watt

The use of Micronetics brand switch is required due to its compatibility with an existing test and measurement system (both hardware and software). The measurement system at the AFRL Research Site is a fully automated system with Micronetics components at the heart. AFRL has invested a substantial amount of manpower and money to integrate the various components of this system. To reconfigure the system to accommodate a brand other than Micronetics would be impractical, inefficient, and result in unjustified costs.

The estimated delivery date is no later than 30 days after contract award date. The place of delivery, acceptance, and FOB destination point is F4HBL1/Transportation Officer Depot 2, 148 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441.

(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror.

The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies. Paragraph (a) - the following evaluation factors shall be used and are in descending order of importance:  Price, Ability to Support Manufacturer Warranty, and Delivery.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

This method may be adjusted, based on quality trends.  The Government retains the right to inspect all requirements of the contract. Unacceptable performance will be recorded and the Contractor shall be required to correct the unacceptable condition within a 24-hour time period.
