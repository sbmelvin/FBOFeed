<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>FAA Evaluation of Electronic Flight Strip (EFS) Capability.   The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) Engage industry in an early dialogue regarding potential use by FAA of an EFS capability; 2) Communicate the FAA's current plans for development of an EFS program; and 3) Obtain industry feedback regarding interest in an EFS program.  This announcement solicits information regarding industry  demonstrations of existing products which will give FAA an indication of the existing capability.  Respondents will not be pre-qualified or screened out as a result of this announcement.      The FAA terminal domain and TRACON/ATCT environment utilize paper flight strips to 1) provide air traffic controllers with flight information; 2) provide a mechanism to identify changes to flight information that is provided to other NAS systems: and 3) provide the ability to move the flight strip information from controller to controller. The FAA is assessing the feasibility of replacing paper flight strip operations with an EFS system.  An EFS system could provide a more efficient movement of flight strip data to the appropriate controllers and provide an effective means of ordering, sequencing, and viewing flight strips.    FAA currently has an Electronic Flight Strip Transfer System (EFSTS) which is operational in the NAS.  The EFSTS replaces the "pneumatic drop tube" system thus providing the capability to transfer electronic flight strip data between sites.  EFSTS does not provide the contemplated EFS capability to transfer flight strip data between controller positions or provide the capability to electronically review, amend, and mark flight strips.  These functions are currently provided via paper flight strips.        This market survey seeks information from companies who would have an interest in demonstrating their EFS equipment for the purpose of assessing the equipment's capabilities and potential benefit to the NAS.   Companies selected for this demonstration must have an existing system in operation in an airport environment.   The FAA plans to conduct the EFS demonstration in the following manner: 1. A follow on public announcement will set forth the minimum performance   parameters that the demonstration EFS system should possess.  2. Company responses will be evaluated against the performance parameters.  3. One or more companies will be selected to participate in a formalized capability demonstration at the vendor site.  4. Upon successful completion of a site capability demonstration at the company site, one or more systems may be evaluated at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey.   5. After Technical Center evaluation, one or more systems may be installed in an operational airport site for further assessment.  6. Appropriate agreements may be negotiated to cover cost of supporting the demonstrations, applicable travel, and cost to modify their system to operate in the NAS environment.  Modifications may include altering the data to coincide with the format currently utilized by FAA controllers.   7. A capability assessment report will be generated which will be shared with the appropriate companies.     Information gained during the capability demonstration may be used by the FAA to develop future EFS requirements and needs. At the present time, there are tentative plans for FY 07 funding to enable an EFS program.  Specific program planning will not begin until FAA has assurance that funding is available.  In the event a program is established, a full and open competition will be conducted for the EFS requirement.  The FAA O'Hare Modernization Program has developed requirements for what is titled the "Advanced Electronic Flight Strip (AEFS) system" which addresses the requirements for a Chicago (ORD) system.  These requirements may be used as an input to assessment of the demonstration system capabilities; however, the goal is not to categorize an EFS system as "meets the requirement or does not meet the requirement".  The goal is to assess the capability of the system against some minimal criteria, collect data to include observed quantitative benefits, and subsequently assess and develop the FAA requirement.   Companies having an interest in participating in this capability demonstration should respond with the following information: 1. A description of their EFS system to include software and hardware.  2. A statement if the EFS capability is a stand-alone capability or is integrated into a larger capability platform.  3. An estimate of the percentage of proprietary software versus unrestricted software. 4. A point of contact at the air traffic location(s) where the vendor EFS  system is in operation. 5. An assessment of the ease of changing the flight strip format to comply with U.S. format, if necessary.  (Flight Strip Format document attached)  6. A description of the system operation/capability to include: ‚Ä¢ Display of flight strip information in user determined order/sequence ‚Ä¢ Modification of flight strip information ‚Ä¢ Transmission of flight strip information to various controller positions. ‚Ä¢ Alerting mechanism to highlight arrival of new flight strips, action required by the controller, and indication of action taken by the controller. ‚Ä¢ User interfaces, i.e. Touch screen/keyboard. ‚Ä¢ Ability to archive flight strip data for an extended period of time. 7.User handbook if available. RESPONSES ARE TO BE SUBMITTED BY 11 AUG 2005.   U.S. Mail deliveries are to be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steve Manley (ATO-A 320) 800 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20519 Express Mail (FEDEX/DHL, etc.) deliveries should be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steve Manley (Room 5-B-33) 600 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20519 E-mail confirmations of all submissions are to be sent to:  "Steve.Manley@faa.gov" Companies are reminded that this announcement is leading toward a proposed demonstration of equipment.  It is not an FAA "acquisition" of EFS equipment.  This is an application of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) to encourage early industry participation in FAA planning activities.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Harvey-Lynch Inc, Stafford, TX for the purpose of repairing, preparing a system integration, training  and provided field support for a multi-channel Digital Seismic Reflection Acquisition System in accordance with the following statement of work.: 1.  Ongoing technical advice on the field system configuration during the proposal and planning stages for the field campaign. 2.  Evaluate and repair as necessary all components of the I/O System Two prior to deployment of the systems on the field campaign.  This would be through a combination of in-house repairs in Houston and on-site visits to NETL‚Äôs geophysical testing sites. 3.  On-site technical support and repairs during the field campaign to insure that the system operates as efficiently as possible and maintains the manufacturer‚Äôs technical specifications. This purchase order is to be issued to Harvey-Lynch Inc., because The University of Pittsburgh and NETL currently have storage (at NETL Pittsburgh Campus) and joint utilization of a multichannel digital seismic reflection acquisition system for research purposes.  NETL is currently pursuing a unique application of this seismic system to map a shallow underground coal mine, in which this application will attempt to map the mine water and gases (e.g. CH4, CO2, O2) and geologic pathways in which these fluids can be transported. Furthermore, developing shallow seismic surveying techniques related to coal mines will be conducted in an urban environment.  Consequently, it is critical from the perspective of the electronic land recording system (manufacturer ‚Äì Input/Output Inc) to have the system evaluated for any potential repairs due to shipping/working condition.  Defective electronics and inappropriate system configuration and integration could do significant and costly harm to the system.  Furthermore, because this system will be utilized by both NETL and the University and both organizations lack experience with this particular system, an adequate training and field support program is required. Harvey-Lynch is the only approved support partner for Input/Output Inc who can supply training, repair, system integration, and field support for the Input/Output System Two recording system, thus providing the vendor with unique capability. Finally, this vendor will also b able to assist in organizing varied industry sources for equipment that is not currently in the existing inventory. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firm‚Äôs ability to provide the services, as described above. This request is considered to be sole source to Harvey-Lynch Inc. Therefore, no solicitation will result for this announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Terry Ackman, Phone 412-386-6566 who is the Technical Representative for the above requirement.  The Contracting Officer is Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770, E-Mail ‚Äì mohn@netl.doe.gov.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Policy Research Associates (PRA), Delmar, NY.
Purpose:
National efforts to address impediments to SSI/SSDI eligibility for people who are homeless and have serious mental illnesses or co-occurring disorders have increased substantially and SAMHSA has had an important role in their development. SAMHSAís efforts have four key components: (1) develop and disseminate knowledge, guidance and training material on the process and practices necessary to enhance access to SSI and SSDI; (2) provide training to trainers in order to increase state and local capacity for on-going training and technical assistance; (3) provide technical assistance to support states and localities; and (4) establish collaborations with governmental and non-governmental agencies to achieve the above.
Policy Research Associates, Inc. (PRA) of Delmar, NY is the only organization capable of performing this award.  PRA has developed a draft 150-page curriculum that is the basis of this training for trainers.  The firm has tested the curriculum in situations very similar to this award, made several revisions, and is in the process of creating a final draft and editing accompanying videos.  After it completes the curriculum, PRA will provide training based on the curriculum that is the same as the training in this contract, and to the same type of audience ñ trainers of case managers, on SSI eligibility issues.  PRA will then use the additional lessons it learns to modify its approach, if needed, to carry out this particular contract.  
Unlike any other firm, PRA has access to the audience as a result of other similar work, and has high general credibility with that audience. It has unique credibility on this topic.  The trainer for the firm on this issue developed the approach that is the basis of the curriculum and training.  PRA is the only nationally known instructor on this topic and has spoken in many policy-related meetings, to top State officials about this issue.  PRA is the only presenter on this topic known to State governmental officials.  The support and consent of these officials is essential for the participation of the proposed trainees. .  PRA has developed the curriculum and techniques to be used in this training of trainers.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<SUBJECT>99--Electronic Flight Strip Capability Demonstration
<SOLNBR>4314
<RESPDATE>080505
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>FAA Evaluation of Electronic Flight Strip (EFS) Capability. The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) Engage industry in an early dialogue regarding potential use by FAA of an EFS capability; 2) Communicate the FAA's current plans for development of an EFS program; and 3) Obtain industry feedback regarding interest in an EFS program.  This announcement solicits information regarding industry  demonstrations of existing products which will give FAA an indication of the existing capability.  Respondents will not be pre-qualified or screened out as a result of this announcement.      The FAA terminal domain and TRACON/ATCT environment utilize paper flight strips to 1) provide air traffic controllers with flight information; 2) provide a mechanism to identify changes to flight information that is provided to other NAS systems: and 3) provide the ability to move the flight strip information from controller to controller. The FAA is assessing the feasibility of replacing paper flight strip operations with an EFS system.  An EFS system could provide a more efficient movement of flight strip data to the appropriate controllers and provide an effective means of ordering, sequencing, and viewing flight strips.    FAA currently has an Electronic Flight Strip Transfer System (EFSTS) which is operational in the NAS.  The EFSTS replaces the "pneumatic drop tube" system thus providing the capability to transfer electronic flight strip data between sites.  EFSTS does not provide the contemplated EFS capability to transfer flight strip data between controller positions or provide the capability to electronically review, amend, and mark flight strips.  These functions are currently provided via paper flight strips.        This market survey seeks information from companies who would have an interest in demonstrating their EFS equipment for the purpose of assessing the equipment's capabilities and potential benefit to the NAS.   Companies selected for this demonstration must have an existing system in operation in an airport environment.   The FAA plans to conduct the EFS demonstration in the following manner: 1. A follow on public announcement will set forth the minimum performance   parameters that the demonstration EFS system should possess.  2. Company responses will be evaluated against the performance parameters.  3. One or more companies will be selected to participate in a formalized capability demonstration at the vendor site.  4. Upon successful completion of a site capability demonstration at the company site, one or more systems may be evaluated at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey.   5. After Technical Center evaluation, one or more systems may be installed in an operational airport site for further assessment.  6. Appropriate agreements may be negotiated to cover cost of supporting the demonstrations, applicable travel, and cost to modify their system to operate in the NAS environment.  Modifications may include altering the data to coincide with the format currently utilized by FAA controllers.   7. A capability assessment report will be generated which will be shared with the appropriate companies.     Information gained during the capability demonstration may be used by the FAA to develop future EFS requirements and needs. At the present time, there are tentative plans for FY 07 funding to enable an EFS program.  Specific program planning will not begin until FAA has assurance that funding is available.  In the event a program is established, a full and open competition will be conducted for the EFS requirement.  The FAA O'Hare Modernization Program has developed requirements for what is titled the "Advanced Electronic Flight Strip (AEFS) system" which addresses the requirements for a Chicago (ORD) system.  These requirements may be used as an input to assessment of the demonstration system capabilities; however, the goal is not to categorize an EFS system as "meets the requirement or does not meet the requirement".  The goal is to assess the capability of the system against some minimal criteria, collect data to include observed quantitative benefits, and subsequently assess and develop the FAA requirement.   Companies having an interest in participating in this capability demonstration should respond with the following information: 1. A description of their EFS system to include software and hardware.  2. A statement if the EFS capability is a stand-alone capability or is integrated into a larger capability platform.  3. An estimate of the percentage of proprietary software versus unrestricted software. 4. A point of contact at the air traffic location(s) where the vendor EFS  system is in operation. 5. An assessment of the ease of changing the flight strip format to comply with U.S. format, if necessary.  (Flight Strip Format document attached)  6.

<DESC>Due to a computer glitch, there were several uploads between 30 March 05 and 1 April 05.  There has only been one official amendment, Amendment 01, that extended the date for receipt of offers. The solicitation marked Amendment 02 has no "draft" watermark on the SF1442 and should be used for providing offers in response to this RFP.  The file marked Solicitation 02 should be disregarded.
