<DESC>F-15E Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice
<p>Description<br />I. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-15E Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in July 2016. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>d) Background: The Combat Air Force's (CAF) Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) program is utilizing training simulation services at ACC, PACAF, and USAFE main operating bases for F-15C, F-15E, F-16 Block 50, and AWACS platforms, with interoperability between sites provided via the DMO Network (DMON). The F-15E MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a commercial training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in July 2016. The Air Force wishes to continue with a simulation services contract on the F-15E MTCs at no less than one (1) location and no more than four (4) locations that may include three (3) USAF CONUS bases and one (1) OCONUS base. Contractors will be responsible for maintaining their simulation services concurrent with changes to aircraft and weapons operating at the respective locations. Each F-15E site will connect into the DMON and will have to meet the CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com). An associate contract agreement with the network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, non-personal services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than three (3) years and no more than ten (10) years (three year base period with seven one year options).</p>
<p>f) All services will be housed in existing Government facilities with minimal infrastructure changes and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government, contract or Air Force instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.<br /><br />g) The purpose of this RFI is to determine offeror interest in providing F-15E MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) The F-15E MTC System will be a high-fidelity immersive simulation system that facilitates F 15E personnel training. This will include maintenance personnel engine run training and aircrew training at all levels, ranging from individual events in a single-ship mode of operation to large-scale, theater specific, composite force combat mission training and rehearsal in a distributed mission operation training environment.</p>
<p>b) The F-15E MTC will be an integrated set of hardware and software that will implement the performance requirements specified in a requirements document that this organization will provide in the request for proposal (RFP). The MTC will be required to support basic and advanced mission training, tactics development, theater exercise support in both local and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) environments, and possibly operational test and evaluation, for all active duty F 15E aircraft employment capabilities.</p>
<p>c) Each F-15E MTC will include either two (2) or four (4) own-ships (one own-ship equals the front and back seat of the same aircraft), with a grand total of no more than 16 own-ships in service. Each Mission Simulator must be concurrent with the fielded aircraft baseline and capable of single-ship, local multi-ship, combat theater missions, and DMO training and mission operations. Each MTC will include computer generated force simulation, scenario generation capability, instructor-operator stations, and brief-debrief systems. Specific performance requirements for all system elements will be defined in the requirements documents, but will be similar to the following requirements for the existing system:<br /><br />1) Cockpits. The simulator system cockpits must be a high-fidelity representation of the F-15E aircraft including: controls, displays, avionics, weapons, sensors, communications, and aerodynamic flight modeling representative of the front and back seat of the F-15E aircraft. The system shall provide realistic simulation of F-15E handling characteristics for all normal ground and flight regimes. The system must be able to accurately represent all aircraft and weapons malfunctions. The system must be equipped with a full field-of-view visual display, digital image generation system for visual, night vision imaging system, joint helmet mounted cueing system (JHMCS), radar data base, and EO/IR data base. The cockpits will be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo aircrew training. Cockpit hardware and software will be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/software technology.</p>
<p>2) Synthetic Environment. The simulator will create a realistic, high fidelity environment capable of supporting a full range of mission scenarios. It will support a mix of constructive and interactive entities that react to aircraft flight maneuvers, avionics, weapons systems, and atmospheric conditions. It will accurately model physical, electronic, aerodynamic capabilities, and fly-out characteristics of real world threats. It will also accurately model and integrate the impact of aircraft countermeasures (i.e., chaff, flares, jamming, anti-radar maneuvers, etc.). It will realistically model electronic combat entities and their effects. Constructive entities will include blue, gray, and red air entities as well as ground based threats (i.e. air platforms, Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites, ground vehicles, ground sites, ground personnel, and maritime targets). Threats will operate under a realistic, dynamic command and control structure. The system will provide aerodynamic and visual simulation of aircraft battle damage.</p>
<p>3) Instructor Operator Station (IOS). Each IOS will provide the instructor the ability to independently monitor the simulation and all displays of an own-ship, or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system will also provide the capability to set up and run one or more independent simultaneous missions. It will also include the ability to simultaneously operate local and long-haul network devices and monitor all missions. This system must be capable of managing a DMO mission environment. The IOS will be capable of controlling and inputting threats, emergency procedures (EPs), malfunctions, instrument indications, and weapons hit/miss data. The IOS must provide means for generation, setup, monitoring, and evaluating simulated training scenarios and missions. These scenarios can be changed or modified by the instructors at any time during the mission via the IOS. The capability to share scenarios and missions between networked sites must be provided. The IOS will give the instructor the capability to insert specific or dynamically created situations into the simulation. This includes EPs, threats, instrument indications, weapon hit/miss data, and other mission events. The IOS will be capable of freezing/resetting individual or all four cockpits scenarios independently. The IOS must be capable of restarting at the point of freeze, start of mission, or at a dynamic instructor-selected point in the mission. The IOS must also be able to set mark points and repeatedly reset to those points. The IOS needs to allow generation of additional scenarios of varying classification levels concurrently with flying a scenario.</p>
<p>4) Visual Display System. The simulator system must include a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity digital image to present the aircrew with realistic, detailed, real-world imagery. This includes a fully correlated "out-the-window" visual display system supporting all aspects of complete mission training, including all cues necessary to support such training, as defined in ACC F-15E training syllabi and the Training Task List (TTL), to include night vision imaging systems. At a minimum, dynamic air model assessments (determination of range, closure, aspect angle, and visual identification) must support multi-ship tactical formations, Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM), and Air Combat Tactics (ACT) cues. Also, the visual system must support various air-to-ground missions such as Surface Attack Tactics (SAT), Close Air Support (CAS), and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), with ground and maritime static and dynamic targets. The visual display (out-the-window and in the cockpit for radar and EO/IR weapons capabilities) will provide a high-fidelity image (contrast, brightness resolution, scene complexity, etc.) to the aircrew.</p>
<p>5) Networking. The MTC must provide local area and wide area network capability and use the most current long-haul networking protocols. The systems will be capable of connecting to and being a full participant in the DMO environment for one, two, or more trainers and will be required to meet the CAF DMO standards.</p>
<p>6) Briefing/Debriefing Facilities. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide a "God's eye" view, selected own-ship or target views, and full battlefield observation (observation of the entire scenario, or a selectable major portion thereof). The system should include the ability to independently observe displays of an own-ship or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected own-ships. The system must have the capability to record full mission data for replay. Brief, real-time observation, and debrief capabilities of this system must support all four own-ships simultaneously. The recordings should be both archivable on removable media and transferable to other sites over the network. Minimum recording time length of 120 minutes will be supported (a longer recording time is highly desired). The current brief/debrief system represents an example of the required capability. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide "before the mission" planning or briefing mode, "after the mission" debrief capability, and "real time" observation capability to watch the mission as it unfolds. The before/after mission period modes require a video teleconferencing capability for all participating crews, at the appropriate classification levels.</p>
<p>d) F-15E aircrew obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, Air Combat Command requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor. <br />e) F-15E MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time.</p>

<DESC>TITLE:  NNA06CD65C WACKENHUT SERVICES, INC.NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the period of performance of Contract NNA06CD65Cwith Wackenhut Services Inc., on a sole-source basis, pursuant to 10.U.S.C. 2304(c)(1),Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy AgencyRequirements. The performance period will be extended for a maximum of three (3) months(January 1, 2012-March 31, 2012). A contract modification reflecting this extension andresultant increase in the estimated Cost Plus- Award Fee (CPAF) of the contract will beissued on or before December 31, 2011, the expiration date of the current fire preventionservices contract.Contract NNA06CD65C, awarded as a result of full and open competition on June 28, 2006with an effective contract date of July 1, 2006, provides fire prevention services to theNASA Ames Research Center (ARC) facilities, the Ames Research Center Campus, AmesResearch Center East Side, NASA Research Park (NRP) the University Affiliated ResearchCenter (UARC), Moffett Federal Airfield and Moffett Community Housing (Orion ParkCommunity). These services, consisting of the emergency response, technical, and supportservices provided by a fire department or fire service provider include, but are notlimited to, the following: control and extinguishment of hostile fire involvingbuildings, structures, vehicles, transportation equipment, vegetation, refuse, andmiscellaneous properties; aircraft rescue fire-fighting; technical rescue; emergencymedical services; hazardous material response, fire prevention and code enforcement; fireinvestigation; fire-rescue automatic and mutual aid; resource management; emergencyapparatus/vehicle maintenance and repair; training and education; fire/life safety publiceducation/awareness and community relations; contract management and administrativeservices; management of records; and emergency management/disaster preparedness.This extension is necessary to maintain critical fire protection services until thecurrent procurement process for the follow-on contract has been completed and a newcontract awarded. Because Wackenhut Services Inc. provides unique expertise in meetingthe fire protection requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequatelyprovide for the maintenance of the Centers fire prevention program during this briefextension period. Award to another source during the procurement phase of the follow-oncontract would result not only in substantial duplication of cost to the Government thatis not expected to be recovered through competition, but also unacceptable delays infulfilling the agencys requirement.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent,interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 9, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Allquestions MUST be in writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m.local time on December 9, 2011.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:<br>W911QY-11-R-0067<br><br>Notice Type:<br>Presolicitaion<br><br>Synopsis:<br>8/24/2011<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Management-Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a requirement for Full Rate (FRP) production of the Lighting Kit Motion Detection (LKMD) program.  LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, LKMD allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations and is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.  The Contractor shall fabricate and integrate components of LKMD systems, conduct First Article Test (FAT), obtain Government approval for the tested articles, conduct Production Acceptance Test (PAT) and deliver FRP systems to the designated Government location along with any associated equipment, material, firmware and software.  The contractor will be required to provide pricing data to permit evaluation of the economic order quantities based on proposed discounts.  The LKMD contract will be awarded using full and open competition. It will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) production contract. The proposed acquisition approach will be for a five-year (two-year base with three (3) one-year option periods) award FFP IDIQ contract valued at approximately $102M for 25,911 production systems and an initial spares package A single award contract is planned, which will further enable life cycle costs, schedule and performance management efficiency. LKMD procurement FY12-16 is the focus for this requirement.  The Government estimates that proposals shall be due not later than 11:00am on 31 October 2011. Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Constance Aviles at connie.aviles@us.army.mil.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE<br />The National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, has a requirement to obtain and analyze data about urologic diseases in America. The burden of urologic diseases on the American public is immense in both human and financial terms, and it remains largely unquantified. Urologic diseases encompass a wide scope of illnesses of the genitourinary tract, including conditions that are congenital and acquired, malignant and benign, male and female, medical and surgical. They can occur at any point in the course of human development, from pre-natal hydronephrosis in utero to incontinence in the elderly. They may be acute and self-limited or chronic and debilitating, may primarily affect quality or quantity of life, and may be financially insignificant or catastrophic. Various government and non-government agencies in the United States maintain a patchwork of population-based studies, observational cohorts, national interview surveys, reviews of physician practice patterns, hospital system databases, regional cancer registries, state health department health information systems, and federal, state, and private insurance claims-based data sets that can provide useful health statistics. These sources contain a wealth of epidemiologic and health services information about health care costs, access, and quality, as well as trends in the diagnosis and management of urologic diseases; however, these information sources have remained largely untapped. The NIDDK initiated the Urologic Diseases in America (UDA) project to delineate the changes in the epidemiology, health economic impact, and practice patterns for the diseases currently included within the scope of practice of the specialty of urology, analyzed retrospectively over a ten-year period. The UDA Compendium consists of data tables annotated in chapters that amplify the data analyses.<br /><br />
<p>The scope of the project shall include: a comprehensive assessment of previous UDA accomplishments and unmet needs; identification of databases available for data acquisition, assessment of available data bases for adequacy to complete the project, and data collection and data interpretation for all benign urologic diseases which fall within the scope of practice of the urologist including, but not limited to, diseases of the prostate (including prostatitis and lower urinary tract symptoms), urolithiasis, urinary tract infections, bladder dysfunctions (including interstitial cystitis, painful bladder symptoms, pediatric urology, infertility and male reproduction), and sexual dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction). In addition, the contractor shall specify the areas for which there is not adequate or reliable data for evaluation, and/or the limitations inherent in the evaluation. Data bases to be accessed may be from federal, state and local governments, health care provider organizations, and industry. Secondary data collected shall be from the most current data files available. Data shall be analyzed from the most current data sets available and retrospectively for a ten-year period (when possible).</p>
<p>The tasks to be performed are to: identify, assess, collect, analyze, verify and collate current data on all benign urologic diseases; develop a set of procedures to facilitate periodic updates of the data for subsequent years; establish a mechanism for data accessibility for future designated special studies and projects; establish a mechanism whereby interested persons can apply for and receive data analyses and writing assistance for specific projects; and prepare the data analyses in a format acceptable for incorporation into narrative chapters designed for dissemination to both health care professionals and patient oriented audiences. Also, the contractor shall arrange, in consultation with the NIDDK, two information dissemination and analysis workshops, and shall publish one update of the UDA Compendium.</p>
<p>A cost-reimbursement type contract using NAICS code 541712 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), is contemplated. NLM intends to award a five year contract beginning on or about July 1, 2012. FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to compete this procurement with full and open competition. The Request for Proposals is expected to be released on or about December 15, 2011 at the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The Air Force is conducting a market research to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to purchasing renewable electric power for the McGuire and Lakehurst portion of Joint Base McGuire Dix Lakehurst, New Jersey. Specifically, the Air Force desires to purchase power generated from a photovoltaic (PV) system located on base, developed and constructed by a private entity or entities. The intent of the Air Force is to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the acquisition of approximately 10 megawatts (MW) of power, without any interest in the ownership of the PV system. The objective would be to incorporate all available Federal and State incentives or rebates for this type of renewable system into the project in order to maximize cost competitiveness with the current electric commodity. The PV systems will be located on the roof tops at McGuire, and land available at McGuire and Lakehurst.. Finally, it is the Air Force desire to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. The local electric utility company, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light (JCP&amp;L), delivers electricity to the McGuire and Lakehurst locations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The electricity (kWh) delivered by JCP&amp;L is purchased through a Defense Logistics Agency Energy <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(DLA-E<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em></span></strong>contract, currently supplied by Hess Energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br /><br />The Air Force requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest with responses to the attached questionnaire and as a minimum supply the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business, (2) capability and pertinent experience, (3) financial capacity to develop and construct a PV system of desired magnitude and (4) points of contact.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - APG (Belvoir Division) (ACC-APG (Belvoir)) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Science and Technology Division (STD) is conducting market research to identify state of the art technology, within industry and academia, in position sensing and augmented reality for handheld explosive hazard detection.  The desire is to track the motion of the handheld mine detector, typically sensors on the end of a stick, and the motion of the operator's head.  Using the information provided by these sensors a head mounted display will show the user where the sensor has traveled and any target detections.  The display will overlay the sensor coverage and detections onto the image of where the user is looking as an augmented reality.  The position sensors will also be utilized in the explosive hazard detection algorithms.  The position accuracy for the sensors needs to be sufficient that the coverage and detections can be overlaid onto where the operator is looking in real time.  The overlays on the ground must be accurate to 5 cm. The system needs to be very light as it will be both held by the operator and mounted on their head.  The system must operate in a wide range of environments and not require any additional hardware that is not mounted on or held by the operator.  Respondents are asked to submit a white paper, of no greater than 10 pages in length, describing the realistic application of their approach using sound scientific theory. Papers should also include point(s) of contact for further Government inquiry should more information be desired. Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sought shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary. Offerors are responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses and/or acquiring test data.  Submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items/services, or for the government to pay for the information received.

The overall goal of this technology is to provide a short range, soldier portable landmine detection and identification capability with a high probability of detection and a low false alarm rate. Specifically, NVESD is seeking well supported novel concepts for a metal detector sensor head, electronics, and signal processing for clutter reduction and target identification. The electromagnetic induction signatures of interest pertain to explosive hazards, to include metal and low-metal landmines and improvised explosive devices. Detection depth and resolution tradeoffs shall be considered. Sensor head position, including height above ground and attitude, as well as tracking information may be available for integration into target identification algorithms. Although the government is considering technologies for applied research, the system's size, weight, power, and cost are relevant factors for systems that could practically be transitioned to the field upon further development. Respondents are asked to submit a white paper, of no greater than 10 pages in length, describing the realistic application of their approach using sound scientific theory.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Automatic Machine Learning
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-12-01 
<RESPDATE>012712
<ARCHDATE>02272012
<CONTACT>Mary Harper, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-12-01@ugov.gov
<DESC><p><strong>Synopsis </strong></p>
<p>This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA investment (such as a program or grand challenge). Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA solicitation and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Scope </strong></p>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is used extensively in application areas of interest to IARPA including speech, language, vision, sensor processing, and multi-modal integration. Typically, expert practitioners in ML select appropriate architectures and algorithms for the application domain, performance requirements, and data characteristics of the problem at hand. Additionally, they engineer an appropriate set of features to be extracted from the data for use in the system design. Then, depending on the problem, data may be selected for training and scheduled for presentation to the system according to the requirements of the task. In some application areas, the data needed for training are extremely sparse, consisting of only a few instances, and important information may be missing, requiring the application of supplementary information and real-world knowledge for intelligent inference. In many other application areas, the amount of data to be analyzed has been increasing exponentially (sensors, audio and video, social network data, web information) stressing even the most efficient procedures and most powerful processors. Most of these data are unorganized and unlabeled and human effort is needed for annotation and to focus attention on those data that are significant.</p>
<p>The focus of this RFI is on recent advances toward automatic machine learning, including automation of architecture and algorithm selection and combination, feature engineering, and training data scheduling for usability by non-experts, as well as scalability for handling large volumes of data. Useful automatic machine learning systems will require significant innovations in the science and technology of machine learning, possibly including (but not limited to) hierarchical architectures like Deep Belief Nets and hierarchical clustering, methods for parallelization of computation, attentional mechanisms for focusing on data of significance, methods for transfer of previously learned knowledge to a new task, methods for incorporation of real-world knowledge to include human advisors and one-shot learning methods, methods to include different temporal scales and the effects of causality, the role of goals and environmental feedback in learning, and model selection from approaches like meta-learning. <br /><br />Responses to this RFI will be used to help focus and organize an interactive workshop of selected machine-learning practitioners with the goal of eliciting plausible next steps through focused presentations of ideas and guided discussions.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should be as succinct as possible while providing specific information that addresses the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What are your proposed methods for (a) automation of architecture and algorithm selection and combination, (b) feature engineering, and (c) training data scheduling? How will these automation methods affect the usability of an analytic system by non-experts?</p>
<p>2. What are the compelling reasons to use your proposed approach in a scalable multi-modal analytic system?</p>
<p>3. How will your approach handle different time scales, missing data, and sparse data?</p>
<p>4. How will your approach be applied to diverse data, such as speech, language, vision, sensor processing, and multi-modal integration?</p>
<p>5. How will you supplement training data with real-world and previously learned knowledge?</p>
<p>6. What is known about your proposed approach? Please provide suitable references.</p>
<p>7. What are the appropriate metrics to measure performance?<br /><br />8. What other solutions are being suggested to overcome the challenges in this RFI?</p>
<p>9. What is the timescale needed to demonstrate progress?</p>
<p>10. What are the data sets and other resources needed?</p>
<p>11. Are supporting technologies readily available or does new technology need to be created?</p>
<p>The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a 1.5-day workshop on automatic machine learning. An expected result is the identification of promising areas for investment through vehicles like seedlings, grand challenges, and programs. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in late March, 2012. A separate workshop announcement will be posted with further details.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents </strong></p>
<p>IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the U.S. <strong>Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.</strong> Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>1.

<a href="mailto:anthony.mcentegart@navy.mil">Contracts POC</a>
<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Systems, Orlando Training Systems Division, in support of the Submarine Piloting and Navigation (SPAN), Reconfigurable Submarine Piloting and Navigation (RSPAN), Virtual Environment Submarine Shiphandling (VESUB), Transit Protection Training System (TPTS), and the Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) trainers, intends to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) on a sole source basis. The SPAN, RSPAN, VESUB, TPTS, and COVE trainers operate on the Virtual Ship software that runs the hydrodynamics, graphics, and visual systems, which are embedded into the Instructor Operator Stations (IOS) and trainers.  The contract period of performance will be a 5 year contract.
  The anticipated value for this contract is $5,000,000.00.
The Virtual Ship commercial software (which was developed at private expense by CSC) was chosen through full and open competition of the Submarine trainers and has been developed to correctly interface with the trainers. Due to the fact that CSC developed this proprietary Virtual Ship software, the Government has limited data rights which prevent another contractor from modifying the software to update or enhance the visual or hydrodynamics systems. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill some aspects of the requirement, integrating new software solutions in place of Virtual Ship would require substantial duplication costs, delays, and modification to the trainers.
 This duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through a competition for this requirement.  
This contract requires the following actions:
	Provide updates, patches, and troubleshooting support for the Virtual Ship software for the life of the contract.
	Upgrade the existing harbor visual databases and develop new harbor databases in the Virtual Ship for various locations, upgrade hardware as necessary, and provide installation support as defined in each individual task, including delivery of updated source code.  
	Modify the Hydrodynamic modeling for own-ship and traffic-ships in the Virtual Ship software environment as required to support various classes of modeled submarines.
 
	Provide a maintenance plan with interface support for the SPAN, RSPAN, VESUB, and Virtual Ship.  
	Provide software development in direct support of fleet modernization initiatives related to the software specific interface functionality of the Virtual Ship software product and the specific training system functional requirements as currently designed utilizing existing Virtual Ship interface federations and capabilities.

The proposed contract action is for requirements for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist, Anthony McEntegart, at anthony.mcentegart@navy.mil, or call at 407-381-8614.

Respondents are advisedthat the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costsincurred in response to this notice and that all costs incurred or associatedwith responding to this notice will be solely at the interested partysexpense.The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Network Enterprise Domain (NED) hascontracted development of the JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM).  JENMenables planning, instantiation, management and over-the-air reconfiguration oftactical networks comprised of software-defined radios from multiple vendors,greatly simplifying network planning and operations as compared to usingseparate management products provided by each qualified radio vendor.  NED isinterested in sharing JENM development plans with radio vendors utilizing theSoldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), and MobileUser Objective System (MUOS) waveform in their tactical radios to generateinterest in vendor participation in JENM development, integration, andtesting.  NED encourages vendors to develop JTRS-capable radios that caninterface with JENM for planning, configuration, reconfiguration, andmonitoring.NED will fund the JENM developer to build JENM interfaces with participatingradio vendors who agree to develop the radio side of the interface with JENM attheir own expense.  Participating radio vendors will be expected to providenecessary interface information and lend equipment to the JENM developer forintegration and test.  If the JENM development contractor opts to offer aJTRS-capable radio in this effort, that contractor will be expected to isolateJENM development from JTRS-capable radio development to ensure confidentialityof information provided by other radio vendors.Future JENM software increments will be tied to Network Integration Evaluation(NIE) events.  These events are held twice per year by the TRIAD (BrigadeModernization Command, System of Systems Integration Directorate, and Army Testand Evaluation Command).  Participating vendors will be expected to provide theabove inputs to NED no less than six (6) months prior to NEDs inclusion ofsupport for Vendors radios in JENM for an NIE event.NED has developed a generic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that more fullydescribes the proposed relationship for this effort.  NED is offering tonegotiate specific terms of this generic MOU with radio vendors who havedeveloped or expect to develop a JTRS-capable radio intended for production andfielding within the JENM development and deployment period.This initiative is in support of the JTRS Enterprise Business Model, whichallows radio developers access to JTRS software for integration into theirproducts without government contracts and funding.  The JTRS EnterpriseBusiness Model is designed to stimulate competition, increase innovation andreduce government costs through software reuse while simultaneously speedingdevelopment and fielding of tactical networking capabilities.  JENM support forradio products developed under the JTRS Enterprise Business Model represents aunique government and industry relationship to aggressively deliver advancedtactical networking capabilities to joint warfighters.Questions concerning this announcement may be directed to Timothy J.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (To be competed at time of award) and that each such policy contains the following clause: "It is agreed that in the event of cancellation or any material change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government in this insurance, 30 days prior written notice will be given to the Contracting Officer."<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters Division, Patuxent River, MD, NAVAIR, HQ, Building 2272, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Patuxent River, MD 20670.<br /><br />The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters Division, Patuxent River, MD intends to award a delivery order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-11-G-0001 to The Boeing Company for the procurement and storage of 20 Sets of Row (P/N F1515596/TAB21461 uses 3 per 5 X 5 AMLCD) and Column (P/N F151515600/TAB21464 uses 6 per 5 X 5 AMLCD) Driver Chips for the 5 X 5 AMLCD glass used on the Multiple Direction Indicator (MDI) Display. The Boeing Company, St Louis, MO , as the Integrator of the F-18, provided notification to the Navy that the row and column driver chips used on the F/A-18 aircraft are going obsolete. There are no other known parts that meet form, fit and function replacement requirements, and a redesign of these parts would cause significant delay and undue costs, therefore, the Navy is pursuing a life of type buy of these driver chips. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the F/A-18 is the only source capable of procuring, managing and storing this part to protect the life cycle in support of the F/A-18. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only on responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).<br />

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; QUOTES are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Therefore, please read this entire notice, the instructions herein, and the attachment documents carefully. This acquisition is on A SMALL BUSINESS BASIS.
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: <br />PLEASE SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK AND EQUIPMENT LIST.<br />HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this project, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration and demonstrate that they are qualified to provide the supplies/services by providing a brief (20 pages or less) Technical and Price Quotes by 12:00 PM, ET, DEC 8, 2011. Technical quotes must include: (1) Specific approach in meeting requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and compatibility of system/process with existing agency configuration. (2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number). References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability. (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. <br />Cost Proposal: provide Firm Fixed-Price "broken out by labor hours, labor category, materials, and other direct costs".

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to incorporate the following changes into the original solicitation #P12PS22092:
(a)  The due date and time for receipt of quotes is extended from Friday, December 2, 2011 at 1:00pm to Tuesday, December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.
(b)  The following wording replaces #2, within Paragraph viii, Documents To Be Included In Quote:"A minimum of 2 sample films, in DVD High Definition format, including written descriptions of the content of the films. One sample needs to be of a historical genre.  One (1) set of DVDs must be sent via mail to Lori Achkar, NPNH MABO Contracting Office, 210 New York Avenue, Staten Island, NY 10305.  In addition, ONLY one (1) set of DVDs shall be sent to Gregory Schwarz, Chief of Interpretation and Visitor Services, Saint-Gaudens, 139 Saint-Gaudens Road, Cornish, NH 03745.  If any other submittals, other than the DVDs, are sent to Gregory Schwarz it may result in a disqualification from this procurement."
(c)  The following wording replaces Paragraph xvi:"Offers, with the exception of DVDs, must be submitted via email to NPNHContracting_BidProposal@nps.gov, to the attention of Lori Achkar, with a courtesy copy sent to lori_achkar@nps.gov.  The due date and time is December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  In order for offers to be considered complete, one set of DVDs must be sent via mail to Lori Achkar, NPNH MABO Contracting Office, 210 New York Avenue, Staten Island, NY10305, by December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  In addition, ONLY one (1) set of DVDs shall be sent to Gregory Schwarz, Chief of Interpretation and Visitor Services Saint-Gaudens, 139 Saint-Gaudens Road, Cornish, NH 03745 by December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  If any other submittals, other than the DVDs are sent to Gregory Schwarz, it may result in a disqualification from this procurement."
(d)  The following questions, submitted in response to the solicitation and their respective answers, are provided:   
1.   Are you open to stock music for the soundtrack or are you requesting an original score? This affects price greatly. 
 Answer:  We are certainly open to stock music.  The film maker can use known period music.  The filmmaker can  add some original compositions.  SAGA is not opposed to that if it works well with the film.
2.   Will there be a kick-off meeting at the site? 
Answer:  Yes. The park anticipates the film maker and the park staff will be in frequent communication during the project.  
3. What format were the original camera tapes shot on? 
Answer:  Mini DV tapes, high definition.  
4. Would we have access to transcripts that have already been created? 
Answer:  Yes
5.   What is the overall budget range for the project? What is the budget range for the optional additional filming? 
Answer:  This information can not be disclosed
6. The scope of work indicates the film will be closed captioned -- it is our understanding that all NPS videos need to have on-screen Subtitles  for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing rather than closed captions; Can you  please confirm that closed captions are required here?
Answer: The film should be Subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing.  We would need a  master copy with the subtitles and a master copy without the subtitles.
7. Often IDIQ rfps provide a target budget - can you provided that information for this project?
Answer:  Can not provide any budgetary information
8. We assume the DVD samples must also be sent to arrive by 1:00 Friday. How many copies do you need?  Should they be sent to your attention at the NPNYH MABO address on Staten Island, sent to your attention?
Answer:  Offers, with the exception of DVDs, must be submitted via email to NPNHContracting_BidProposal@nps.gov, to the attention of Lori Achkar, with a courtesy copy sent to lori_achkar@nps.gov.  The due date and time is December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  In order for offers to be considered complete, one set of DVDs must be sent via mail to Lori Achkar, NPNH MABO Contracting Office, 210 New York Avenue, Staten Island, NY10305, by December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  In addition, ONLY one (1) set of DVDs shall be sent to Gregory Schwarz, Chief of Interpretation and Visitor Services Saint-Gaudens, 139 Saint-Gaudens Road, Cornish, NH 03745 by December 6, 2011 at 10:00am.  If any other submittals, other than the DVDs are sent to Gregory Schwarz, it may result in a disqualification from this procurement.
9. As IDIQ contractors, is there any reason we should not respond to this rfp?
Answer:  No
10. Finally, in terms of the optional work, can you please provide any  more detail about what the might be required?  We assume it might mean  new location shooting in Cornish NH at the Saint-Gaudens National  Historic Site, is this a fair assumption?
Answer: Yes additional footage would have to be shot on location in Cornish, NH at the Saint-Gaudents National Historic Site.  
11. In trying to determine a budget for the orientation piece I need to know if you want original music or if we can utilize the music that was used in the pbs film or find other music from the period that is not costly.
Answer:  Some of the music in the film is an original composition and would not be available. Other pieces are known classical works. They are welcome to use other period music.
12. Do I need to view the footage that's available prior to submitting my proposal and how do I do that?  In other words, can I go up to Cornish and see the raw tapes or do I order a copy of the tape from PBS.  What is name of the documentary that was aired?
Answer:  Vendors are welcome to view the completed film as well as  raw footage, at the park.  The film title is: Augustus Saint-Gaudens: Master of American Sculpture
13. What format is the existing footage in?
Answer:  Mini DV tapes.  High definition
15. The  solicitation notes that there is already footage from previous work. We are curious why you are considering "optional work" if the 15-minute film will be cut from the existing footage and also why the existing footage would be "deemed unusable."
Answer:  Technical problems with the tape, for instance if some were damaged in some way.  They remind one of cassette tapes, I can well imagine that they could be damaged.
(e)  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Brand Name Justification:Brand Name JustificationSybase has been used at the NRC since 1996 to support its present and future implementation of client-server and Web applications. The Sybase software has been tested, implemented and remains in NRC?s infrastructure. These licenses are to ensure that all NRC employees and contractors utilize Sybase software legally.  Sybase is approved by the NRC Enterprise Change Control Board (ECCB) and is listed in the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Technical Reference Model as authorized software to be used at the NRC environment.  The Sybase software has been thoroughly tested and all client-server and Web applications utilizing Sybase currently have an Authority to Operate (ATO). Introducing a new DBMS would require additional funding for modifications and testing of existing production applications. In summary, purchasing software already in use is a response to guidance specified in NRC?s IT/IM Strategic Plan and the Technical Reference Model, and allows the client-server and Web systems to maintain its ATO.  A loss of the ATO would cause an interruption in service that the infrastructure cannot afford. The offeror shall direct all questions relating to this solicitation only to the NRC Contract Specialist.  The offeror shall direct any questions relating to the fedbid.com website to fedbid.com by email or by telephone.
All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. All resellers must be "authorized" resellers of the products list.<BR><BR>The Government will only consider open market quotations.  Quotations from Federal Supply Schedule contracts or GWAC contracts will not be considered.
Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy.
Offers shall attach the license agreement with their bids.<BR><BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination.<BR><BR>(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations according to the instructions in the solicitation before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations should show? (1) The solicitation number; (2) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (3) If license agreement(s) apply, provide a copy of the applicable license agreement(s);(4) Documentation that shows how the offered products comply with Section 508 standards that are included elsewhere in this solicitation (if applicable);(5) If the offeror is a reseller/business partner and is offering product(s) that their company does not manufacture, the offeror should provide evidence that the offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to sell the products or services being offered.(6) A copy of the terms of any express warranty being offered for the offered products; (7) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price and any discount terms.  The pricing structure in the quotation may differ from the pricing structure in the solicitation as long as all specifications and other requirements are met;(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments (if any); (10) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.***<BR><BR>For this solicitation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Brand Name Justification:Brand Name JustificationSybase has been used at the NRC since 1996 to support its present and future implementation of client-server and Web applications. The Sybase software has been tested, implemented and remains in NRC?s infrastructure. These licenses are to ensure that all NRC employees and contractors utilize Sybase software legally.  Sybase is approved by the NRC Enterprise Change Control Board (ECCB) and is listed in the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Technical Reference Model as authorized software to be used at the NRC environment.  The Sybase software has been thoroughly tested and all client-server and Web applications utilizing Sybase currently have an Authority to Operate (ATO). Introducing a new DBMS would require additional funding for modifications and testing of existing production applications. In summary, purchasing software already in use is a response to guidance specified in NRC?s IT/IM Strategic Plan and the Technical Reference Model, and allows the client-server and Web systems to maintain its ATO.  A loss of the ATO would cause an interruption in service that the infrastructure cannot afford. The offeror shall direct all questions relating to this solicitation only to the NRC Contract Specialist.  The offeror shall direct any questions relating to the fedbid.com website to fedbid.com by email or by telephone.
All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. All resellers must be "authorized" resellers of the products list.<BR><BR>The Government will only consider open market quotations.  Quotations from Federal Supply Schedule contracts or GWAC contracts will not be considered.
Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy.
Offers shall attach the license agreement with their bids.<BR><BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination.<BR><BR>(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations according to the instructions in the solicitation before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations should show? (1) The solicitation number; (2) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (3) If license agreement(s) apply, provide a copy of the applicable license agreement(s);(4) Documentation that shows how the offered products comply with Section 508 standards that are included elsewhere in this solicitation (if applicable);(5) If the offeror is a reseller/business partner and is offering product(s) that their company does not manufacture, the offeror should provide evidence that the offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to sell the products or services being offered.(6) A copy of the terms of any express warranty being offered for the offered products; (7) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price and any discount terms.  The pricing structure in the quotation may differ from the pricing structure in the solicitation as long as all specifications and other requirements are met;(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments (if any); (10) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation.

<DESC>Please see attached amendment for additional requirement details.  These lighting fixtures will be pole mounted. <br><br>If the vendors are experiencing certificate problems provide them with the<br>following:<br><br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the<br>forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).<br>ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may<br>have noticed an IE alert stating our ASFI root certificate was not issued by<br>a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br><br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

<CONTACT>Bernard F. Collins, IC Acquisition & Technology Assessment Officer, Email InnovativeSpaceAcq@dni.gov
<DESC>Synopsis<br />The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Associate Director for Acquisition, Technology and Facilities (ADNI/AT&amp;F) is interested in innovative approaches to reducing costs in satellite acquisition. In response to this "Meyerriecks Challenge", the ODNI requests feedback and critique from the space industry to refine preliminary concepts. Alternative acquisition approaches which may be more cost effective will be considered. These comments, approaches, and concepts will be reviewed and compiled into a refined acquisition concept for industry preview in January 2012.
<p><br />Background<br />Over the years, many publications have described the degenerative state of affairs in space acquisition and have suggested ways to change the industry and the government. Some ideas have been implemented while others are under consideration, but there remains more to do. These proposed solutions run the gamut of changing organizations, processes, skill set development, manufacturing techniques, contracting approaches, and policy. The ODNI is particularly interested in exploring an industry wide approach using scalable spacecraft data and power architectures built on open standards with selected common components. This approach is analogous to the personal computer development model where industry wide standards for defined interfaces and protocols played a vital role in the PC's exponential performance improvement during a time of significant cost reduction. While it is true that individual companies have experienced moderate success with their own standards and common components, it is postulated that executing a cost effective satellite acquisition concept with open standards industry wide would reduce costs while increasing quality, and eventually, performance. The objective is to save 20% to 40% on the nation's entire satellite investment over a decade. ODNI is developing a satellite market model (Diagram 1) to analyze the effect of potential measures on community costs, This approach would not be successful without a compelling business case and full support and engagement of both government and space industry stakeholders. Diagram 2 illustrates that, because of the overall volume, it is imperative we engage the entire US market.</p>
<p>Scope<br />This RFI applies primarily to bus and payloads of all types of satellites, whether commercial or government sponsored. In order to make the business case close, the ODNI would like to explore concepts of affordability that can apply as widely as possible to all satellites. It is recognized that not all subsystems are appropriate for common components or full integration using standardized electrical or data architectures. However, we believe that with appropriate changes to government acquisition methods, we can achieve significant cost savings. Considerations may include reductions to non-recurring engineering efforts, simplification of system integration, improvements to mass and power efficiency, reduction to initial investments, and improved return on investments. This RFI does not address launch or ground systems; otherwise, we do not want to restrict industry ideas for more cost effective approaches. Our initial concept is being developed in an Innovative Space Acquisition Study (ISAS); more detail is available at: http://dni.gov/Innovative Space Acquisition Briefing.ppt</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br />Please send a five page concept paper or 10 page briefing package, by 23 Dec 2011, to the email address listed below, describing your ideas and including your contact information. As appropriate, we will contact you for clarification.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES This RFI is issued solely for information and potential planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the ODNI is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. It is the respondents' responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded whatever research is referred to in their response.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Proprietary concepts and information should not be included in the submittal. If classified information would enhance the submission, contact the points of contact below to arrange for that submission. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by ODNI from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP) - Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Extension of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Contract No. FA8807-07-C0002</p>
<p>Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), 483 North Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, California, 90245-2808 intends to issue a sole source contract action to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services, Los Angeles, California, 90056-1299, to provide Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) support services to SMC/GP for up to 12 months beginning no earlier than 9 March 2012. This contract action will effectively extend the period of performance of the SE&amp;I services currently being acquired under Contract FA8807-07-C-0002, thereby providing SMC/GP sufficient time to complete a source selection and award a long-term follow-on contract. Unless the award decision for the follow-on contract is protested, after award of that long-term follow-on contract, SMC/GP will not exercise any remaining options and will terminate for convenience the remaining period of performance of the contract action that is the subject of this synopsis. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 5.207(e), the classification code for this synopsis is 18 (Space Vehicles). Pursuant to FAR Section 5.207(c)(6), approximately 353,788 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3600 appropriations, and approximately 18,123 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3020 appropriations. A copy of the existing Statement of Work (SOW) is appended herewith for reference.</p>
<p>This contract provides a highly capable SE&amp;I contractor/team to produce and manage the GPS technical baseline in support of SMC/GP. The SE&amp;I's role in the accomplishment of this mission will involve, but is not limited to, development and implementation of directives and standards, improved and dynamic communications, new tools and techniques to predict issues early enough to change the outcome or minimize the effect on the enterprise, disciplined processes to develop and maintain the systems baseline documents and interfaces, and performance metrics that ensure continuous integration and operational capability improvements (measures of effectiveness). The current contract was awarded 9 March 2007. All options have been exercised and the contract will expire on 8 March 2012.</p>
<p>This contract action will be awarded to SAIC S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services as the only responsible source that can continue to provide these highly specialized services, as it is likely that award to any other source would result in the Air Force incurring substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition, experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements, or both. (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 15 days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis, which shall be considered by the agency. The SOC must include the following information: Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification (Large, Small, or Other), Personnel/Size Standard and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Interested parties must demonstrate in their SOC they have the capability to provide the systems and services to fulfill the government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. Interested parties must also demonstrate how an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment activities described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. No classified information shall be submitted. Verbal responses will not be accepted. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:<br>W911QY-11-R-0067<br><br>Notice Type:<br>Presolicitaion<br><br>Synopsis:<br>8/30/2011<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Management-Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a requirement for Full Rate (FRP) production of the Lighting Kit Motion Detection (LKMD) program.  LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, LKMD allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations and is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.  The Contractor shall fabricate and integrate components of LKMD systems, conduct First Article Test (FAT), obtain Government approval for the tested articles, conduct Production Acceptance Test (PAT) and deliver FRP systems to the designated Government location along with any associated equipment, material, firmware and software.  The contractor will be required to provide pricing data to permit evaluation of the economic order quantities based on proposed discounts.  The LKMD contract will be awarded using full and open competition. It will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) production contract. The proposed acquisition approach will be for a five-year (two-year base with three (3) one-year option periods) award FFP IDIQ contract valued at approximately $102M for 25,911 production systems and an initial spares package A single award contract is planned, which will further enable life cycle costs, schedule and performance management efficiency. LKMD procurement FY12-16 is the focus for this requirement.  The Government estimates that proposals shall be due not later than 2:00p.m. on 31 October 2011.

1.	Will the VA location supply us with a list of the line items in the Pharmacy?  

No.  This will be handled differently by each VA location.  The Pharmacy department (COTR's) will provide direction on what items are to be included in the inventory.

1.	If so, what information will be on the list?
2.	Will we be able to work 'off-hours', that is can our team work in the evenings when pharmacy activity will be low?

As noted in the statement of work, the inventory will be scheduled for a date and time specified by the Chief, Pharmacy Service, at each location.  This may vary per location and could include "off-hours".  The time will be determined by the Chief.

MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES
This is a market survey for Instructional Support Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing Instructional Support Services.                                                                                                                                                        This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611519, Electronic Equipment Repair Training, with a size standard of $7,000,000.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
General Information:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that can provide instructional support services required by Technical Operations Training Division (AMA-400), at the FAA Academy, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Overview -The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional and related support services to augment existing Technical Operations Training Division (AMA-400) staff in the completion of its tasked activities. The contractor will provide those on-site personnel needed to effectively manage and supervise the contract staff and perform clerical and administrative functions. The FAA Academy is a resident training center. On average, AMA-400 has 535 active courses that provide approximately 1250 resident class deliveries per year. This equates to approximately 6500 resident completions and 850,000 resident hours annually.  
The requirement centers primarily on the instructional delivery of AMA-400 technical training. This includes theoretical and practical training in one or more subjects on assigned National Airspace System (NAS) equipment and systems for field technical experts involved with the installation and maintenance of such equipment and systems.  Delivery of instructional courses is in accordance with FAA training procedures, guidelines, and methodologies. Instructors are required to follow prepared lesson plans and ensure stated course objectives are presented.  Instructors will utilize such teaching methods as lecture, lab demonstrations, and remedial discussion. The instructor selects/uses or develops teaching aids such as, but not limited to, lesson plans, student guides, lab guides, handouts, wall charts, prepared notes, and use of actual lab equipment.  Contract instructors may also be required to provide support as subject matter experts in the development, revision, and maintenance of course materials, utilizing all applicable media.  
The FAA may also identify requirements for other instructional support personnel including but not limited to, instructional systems design specialists, course developers, technical writers, and graphic artists, web and eLearning developers.
The instructional system design specialist is responsible for organizing and conducting research, development, evaluation, revision, and maintenance of training materials for resident, field, and distance learning training courses, supporting the National Airspace System (NAS). Knowledge of major principles and theories in human learning and cognitive psychology is required in order to determine instructional objectives and task learning relationships, classify instructional objectives, and develop course content sequences.  Additionally, knowledge of principles, methodologies, and techniques of task analysis is required in order to ensure training outcomes are congruent with required knowledge, skills, and abilities.
Instructional development and revision of course materials and support media for resident, field and web/eLearning/distance learning courses would be performed by course developers, illustrators, and technical writers with applicable experience in the following areas: art and design, drafting, desktop publishing, computer animation, courseware development authoring languages, ability to proofread and edit material for reports, manuals, briefs, proposals, instructional books, catalogs, and training publications, or related specialty materials.

Past Performance and Experience - The FAA is looking for a contractor with a proven track record of excellence in the performance of contracts in an environment of a similar size and complexity.  The contractor is required to show three (3) years experience within the past five (5) years in instructional support and delivery.  Past and present contract performance information must demonstrate the contractor is capable to perform the proposed effort.  The contractor should demonstrate technical expertise and capability to perform the requirements listed.  
This announcement is not a Screening Information Request or a Request for Proposal of any kind.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or for any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA certified 8(a) firms and small business concerns.   The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing instructional support services.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other small business competitive procurement procedures. Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter (if applicable).
The failure to obtain adequate 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
 Response to this Market Survey -
Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Responses must be received no later than 3:30 P.M, Central Time on December 1st, 2011.

<SOLNBR>HQ0147-12-R-AWLR
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>011812
<CONTACT>Janice S Olson, Phone 256-450-4330, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC><br />1. Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions.

<p>(4) Technical risks.</p>
<p>F. System Considerations.</p>
<p>(1) Kinematic intercept capabilities/envelope against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight (boost, mid-course, and terminal) as specified in the classified exemplar threat trajectories package.</p>
<p>(2) Operating area for each interceptor against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight as specified in the exemplar threat trajectories.</p>
<p>(3) Time-to-launch, given threat notification.</p>
<p>(4) Alternative missions or engagement regimes supported.</p>
<p>G. Sensor and Integrated Sensor Approach Performance. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 1: Sensor Performance Template.</p>
<p>H. Interceptors. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 2: Interceptor Performance Template.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Systems, Orlando Training Systems Division, in support of the Submarine Piloting and Navigation (SPAN), Reconfigurable Submarine Piloting and Navigation (RSPAN), Virtual Environment Submarine Shiphandling (VESUB), Transit Protection Training System (TPTS), and the Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) trainers, intends to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) on a sole source basis. The SPAN, RSPAN, VESUB, TPTS, and COVE trainers operate on the Virtual Ship software that runs the hydrodynamics, graphics, and visual systems, which are embedded into the Instructor Operator Stations (IOS) and trainers.  The contract period of performance will be a 5 year contract.
  The anticipated value for this contract is $5,000,000.00.
The Virtual Ship commercial software (which was developed at private expense by CSC) was chosen through full and open competition of the Submarine trainers and has been developed to correctly interface with the trainers. Due to the fact that CSC developed this proprietary Virtual Ship software, the Government has limited data rights which prevent another contractor from modifying the software to update or enhance the visual or hydrodynamics systems. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill some aspects of the requirement, integrating new software solutions in place of Virtual Ship would require substantial duplication costs, delays, and modification to the trainers.
 This duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through a competition for this requirement.  
This contract requires the following actions:
	Provide updates, patches, and troubleshooting support for the Virtual Ship software for the life of the contract.
	Upgrade the existing harbor visual databases and develop new harbor databases in the Virtual Ship for various locations, upgrade hardware as necessary, and provide installation support as defined in each individual task, including delivery of updated source code.  
	Modify the Hydrodynamic modeling for own-ship and traffic-ships in the Virtual Ship software environment as required to support various classes of modeled submarines.
 
	Provide a maintenance plan with interface support for the SPAN, RSPAN, VESUB, and Virtual Ship.  
	Provide software development in direct support of fleet modernization initiatives related to the software specific interface functionality of the Virtual Ship software product and the specific training system functional requirements as currently designed utilizing existing Virtual Ship interface federations and capabilities.

The proposed contract action is for requirements for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist, Anthony McEntegart, at anthony.mcentegart@navy.mil, or call at 407-381-8614.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) anticipates issuance of a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) VA118A-12-RP-00118 for Real Time Location Systems (RTLS).  In support of VA Transformation Initiative Health Care Efficiency, the RTLS solution shall support the objectives of focused clinical and administrative process efficiency and total asset visibility.  The mission of the RTLS Program is to provide multiple technologies to include Wi-Fi based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, such as ultrasound and infrared when a Wi-Fi based solution is not feasible. These technologies will be used to track the location and flow of assets and people, as well as monitoring factors, such as temperature.  These capabilities can result in the design of more optimal processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, reductions in staff hours spent searching for equipment, and the ability to maintain more accurate less expensive inventory levels within VA.  The purpose of the RTLS solution is to improve the efficiency of targeted business processes in its hospitals, clinics, offices and cemeteries to support the missions of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and other VA entities.  The designated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334119, Other Computer Peripheral Equipment with a business size standard of 1-1000 employees.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<AWDNBR>FA4610-06-C-0001
<MODNBR>P000XX
<AWDDATE>082806
<ARCHDATE>12312011
<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides tentative notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract, FA4610-06-C-0001, with Santa Barbara Applied Research, Inc., 2151 Alexandro Dr Ste 220, Ventura, CA 93001-3777 for a period of three (3) months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 January 2012 through 31 Mar 2012. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) Protest has been filed challenging the award of the follow-on Minuteman Launch Support Services contract (FA4610-09-R-0013/FA4610-12-C-0001). This extension is needed to satisfy the requirements of the 576th Flight Test Squadron, Air Force Global Strike Command, to provide Minuteman Launch Support Services (MLSS) until a formal GAO decision has been made. The 576th FLTS MLSS contract provides for a wide range of support services for Force Development Evaluation Minuteman Launches at Vandenberg AFB. Support services include, but are not limited to: launch facility refurbishment, corrosion control services, vehicle issue and control, management services, and training services which support critical mission requirements. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the above services at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) outlined above. This three-month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.This notice is being posted since this option under FAR 52.217-8 was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award for FA4610-06-C-0001. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8 and will extend the period of performance end date from 31 Dec 2011 to 31 Mar 2012. This option exercise will further allow for the GAO decision and subsequent award of the follow-on competitive procurement, FA4610-09-R-0013, (which is currently posted to FBO). The extension will allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. Santa Barbara Applied Research, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8 within 15 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise. A determination by the Government to exercise the aforementioned option clause and not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to exercise the option. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Jeffrey Powell via email address: Jeffrey.powell@vandenberg.af.mil.
