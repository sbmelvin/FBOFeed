<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command, APG, Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the US Army Garrison - Natick Directorate of Operations intends extend the current firm fixed price contract W911QY18P0132 for additional 8 months. The current was awarded under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to Metro Surveillance Systems of 655 Killingly Street, Johnston, RI 02919 for the maintenance of currently installed CCTV System, the Fiber Security Fence alarms and the Electronic Barrier systems. Metro Surveillance Systems is the original company that installed the current surveillance system that Natick Solider System Center (NSSC) uses on the installation and possesses the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) certifications to maintain the systems without invalidating any warranties. There is a concern that if too many contractors have knowledge of the systems that are used at NSSC, it could compromise the security of the installation. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT- The 142nd Contracting Office at the Portland Air National Guard, under the United States Property and Fiscal Office for Oregon (USPFO for Oregon), intends to solicit and award a sole source contract to Terra Hydr, Inc LLC, DUNS: 7921-10561, CAGE Code: 1YYL6 for providing the Oregon Air National Guard's (ORANG).&nbsp; The statutory authority permitting acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition will result in a stand-alone, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), bridge contract.</p>
<p>The service contract expired and the proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing on-going operational services while the follow-on action is being prepared.</p>
<p>Moreover, to conduct an operator transition while the requirement is being re-competed and another transition once the new contract award is in place would be very costly to the Government.</p>
<p>Consequently, due to the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government could incur and not recover through competition, the deicing pond maintenance will be procured on a sole source basis as the aforementioned bridge contract.</p>
<p>This is a non-personnel service contract to provide deicing retention pond monitoring water monitoring, and maintenance service. The deicing monitoring system is required by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) issue permit to allow storm water to be discharged from the installation according to environmental impacts of our pavement and deicing chemicals. Without the continuous monitoring provided by this equipment, our base could not discharge storm water in daily quantity batches allowed by the permit.</p>
<p>Market research and a previous solicitation has found only Terra Hydr, Inc capable of providing the service. Terra Hydr, Inc is the only immediate practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services by previously trained staff without causing a break or any disruption in work.</p>
<p>Terra Hydr, Inc possess the minimum of 2-years' experience maintaining the following deicing pond equipment: BIOX 1010/1015 BOD5 online analyzer (as manufactured by Endress and Hauser) with remote radio transmission display; 6700FR Automatic Sampler (as manufactured by Teledyne ISCO); accQmin flow meter (as manufactured by Teledyne ISCO); and 4210 flow meter (as manufactured by Teledyne ISCO).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procurement is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 811310 Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment and the Small Business size standard is $7.5 Million.</p>
<p>Although firms can respond to this notice with a Capability Statement, the Government has the discretion to proceed with the sole source or not.</p>
<p>Parties interested in responding to this notice are invited to submit a capability statement which includes sufficient details for consideration by the Government, including costs.</p>
<p>For those reasons as stated above, THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, however all responsible sources that believe they can meet all of the requirements may contact the Contracting Office via e-mail at michael.t.kitchell2.mil@mail.mil and be considered by the government. If no responses are received by 2:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time,&nbsp;9 February 2019, a Sole Source contract will be pursued with Terra Hydr, Inc.</p>

<DESC><br />The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to MacArthur &amp; Baker International, Inc. (d/b/a MBI Consulting, 7200 Wisconsin Ave Suite 702, Bethesda, MD 20814-4891under the statutory authorities 41 USC 3304 (a)(1) (see FAR 6.302-1) to provide Post Closing Portfolio Management (PCPM) and Surplus Cash Analysis (SCA) for the support HUD-held debt generated by several HUD programs. HUD requires support for HUD's Project Managers (PMs) nationwide in analyzing certain unique loans that have been and will be created and held by HUD under: The M2M Program. Portfolio Re-Engineering Demonstration Program (or "Demo Program") and the Partial Payment of Claim (PPC) Program. The M2M Program was established in the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act (MAHRA) was created to restructure the FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage loans on a large number of privately-owned properties with above-market rents and expiring project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts. The PPC Program is conducted pursuant to authority found at the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 24, and Section 207.258(b). When the expiring Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts for a property are determined to be above the market rate, the property owner is required to participate in the Mark-to-Market Restructuring Program in order to receive a new project-based HAP Contract. Generally, as a result of participation in the M2M Program or the Demo Program, the above market rate subsidized rents are reduced to market rate and the existing property debt is restructured to a size supportable by the cash flow generated at the market rate rent level. The expected cash flow is determined by a re-underwriting, which analyzes and evaluates the property's capital needs and operating expenses to ensure that the property can be financially viable and remain in good physical condition based on projected net income at market rents. A partial payment of claim against the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Insurance Fund is made for any difference between the total sources at closing (the new first mortgage proceeds, together with any required Owner funds and eligible property accounts) and total uses (payoff of the existing FHA-insured mortgage and funding for all eligible uses, including rehabilitation escrows, initial deposit to replacement reserves, approved closing costs, etc.) In the M2M Restructuring process, the partial claim amount is not forgiven, but is captured in a new mortgage note or notes payable to HUD and secured in a subordinate lien position to any new first-mortgage financing on the property. A payment may be due annually on these new notes as defined in the legal documents arising from the restructuring transaction. The payment for each of these HUD-held notes (if required) is calculated at a specific fixed percentage of the property's annual surplus cash and is calculated and shown in the year-end financial statements for a property.
<p>HUD is restructuring another group of loans, known as PPC Loans, using a process similar to a M2M restructuring. However, they are not part of the M2M Program and are governed by different rules and requirements under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 24, Section 207.258(b). In a PPC restructuring, the existing property debt is restructured to an amount the property can sustain with the cash flow after operating expenses and contributions to the reserve for replacements account. In addition, capital needs and operating expenses are analyzed and are underwritten to ensure that the property is financially and physically sound. In the PPC Program there is no programmatic requirement to reduce the rents, but the property's physical requirements and financial viability are considered when determining the amount of the Partial Payment of Claim (PPC). Once the PPC amount is determined and the property Owner agrees to repay that amount to HUD by executing a new HUD-held note. The M2M rules for determining the amount of annual payment due is applied unless unique circumstances require a different treatment. The period of performance is for a 6-month base period plus a 6- month option periods. The NAICS code is 532920 Portfolio Management and the size standard is 38.5. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may submit a written response via email to Brenda Lee at the email address below by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on February 26, 2019. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information received will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, HUD will proceed with the sole source award to MacArthur &amp; Baker International, Inc. (d/b/a MBI Consulting. The anticipated award date of this requirement is on or around February 28, 2019. No calls will be accepted. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Brenda K. Lee at brenda.k.lee@hud.gov.</p>

Region 8 requires the contractor to be available to respond during facility operating hours during a standard 8 hour work day and provide for emergency call personnel on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Excluded from operations and maintenance services are the housing units located at the port facilities, except for electrical systems and equipment. Other exclusions from the requirement include security systems, telecommunication systems, equipment owned and operated by the tenant agencies, furnishings (not installed fixtures), kitchen appliances and equipment (except ductwork, grease traps, and associated fire suppression and alarm equipment), equipment owned by public utilities, upgrades of software and software licenses, and fitness center equipment. The contractor shall be responsible for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repairs of equipment and systems located within the property line of the Port Facilities. Other services provided at the facilities include snow removal and grounds maintenance. Contractor is responsible for furnishing all necessary heavy equipment and other items needed to clear or haul snow and ice from parking areas, roads, driveways, plaza areas, and other covered areas within the property line.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Operations and maintenance work includes preventative and predictive maintenance of building systems and equipment. The contractor is required to conduct tours of the building equipment at set frequencies and record information in accordance with appropriate procedures. Generally, operational services shall be provided for all systems to maintain a safe and healthy environment operating within normal parameters. Efficiency of operation shall be maintained in order to preserve the asset value of the facility and systems and minimize operating costs to the Government.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Generally, the anticipated scope is for performance-based services that describe the expected outcomes and results within measurable standards to evaluate performance. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordination efforts, communication, quality control, management of records and reports, and scheduling. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the management and supervision of all subcontractors.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Justification for Sole Source Contracting Action. </strong>The incumbent contractor, ProSource Consulting, LLC is uniquely positioned to have a competitive advantage that could not be reasonably overcome through a competitive acquisition process. As a three month contract for bridge services it is impractical for a new contractor to recover costs. Identified costs include processing security clearances, mobilization costs, inspection of existing conditions, development of a quality control program, hiring, training, and other startup costs. ProSource Consulting, LLC is already mobilized at the facilities and will not incur these initial costs. The remote location of the facilities also presents significant costs of mobilization, and no other sources are located in the surrounding area to offset these costs. Accordingly, if the requirement was competed, there is a reasonable expectation that the Government would not receive a proposal from at least one other source for a three-month contract.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Other considerations include the importance of a continuity of operations at the port facilities to avoid a lapse in support services. The operations, maintenance, custodial, and other facility support services provided at these locations are critical to safety, security, general well-being, and operational missions of the facilities. Facility support services are also necessary to preserve the asset and ensure efficient and economical operations.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Efforts to Obtain Competition. </strong>General knowledge of the Montana market from GSA officials and past acquisition efforts and experience support the&nbsp;decision not to compete the requirement. It is highly unlikely that any other contractor is proximate enough to the project locations to overcome identified initial costs over a three-month period; these costs are not incurred by the incumbent contractor. Region 8 is actively working on a new contract with a base period, and four, one-year option periods that is economically viable for other interested contractors. Region 8 made reasonable planning efforts to compete and procure services for full facilities maintenance at the Port Facilities. However, delays outside the Government's control adversely impacted the schedule and has resulted in a planning horizon that is unreasonable to effectively procure the required services before the expiration of the existing contract. Thus, the proposed sole source contracting action to add three months through 02/01/2019 and 04/30/2019 to the existing contract is the best decision given the acquisition history and circumstances.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Additional Information. </strong>This special notice shall not be construed as a request for proposal nor as a commitment by the Government. The Government shall not be responsible for any costs incurred in response to this special notice.</div>

The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>COR AUTHORITIES AND LIMITATIONS<br />After obtaining the required FAC-COR Certification, the Contracting Officer will designate in writing, the position of COR, to take certain actions under the contract(s) requiring oversight. The designation memorandum will specify the scope and limitations of the authority to be delegated.</p>
<p>The COR is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate.  The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development. The COR will be responsible for:</p>
<p>&bull;	Developing a strong working relationship with the Contracting Officer<br />&bull;	Promptly notifying the Contracting Officer in writing of any noncompliance or deviation in performance or failure to make progress<br />&bull;	Maintaining constant cognizance with respect to technical compliance with contract terms on part of the Contractor<br />&bull;	Knowing and understanding the terms and provisions of the contract<br />&bull;	Knowing the scope and limitations of the COR position's authority <br />&bull;	Using good judgment, skill and reasonable care in the exercise of the COR position's authority<br />&bull;	Protecting privileged and sensitive procurement information<br />&bull;	If appropriate, periodically visiting the Contractor's workplace<br />&bull;	Serving as the property administrator for the contract(s) assigned<br />&bull;	Establishing and maintaining adequate COR files<br />&bull;	Preparing performance assessments for input into the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)</p>

<p><br />COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.</p>
