<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking United States incorporated/based non-federal partners ("Collaborators") in industry and/or academia to consider for entry into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) described in 15 USC 3710a to produce collaborative studies illustrating potential future capabilities for USTRANSCOM.&nbsp; Response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to assist the Government understand the qualifications of entities that have deep expertise in this field and who may be suitable partners in sharing information/developing studies on&nbsp; employment of Risk Management Framework (RMF) practices and tools, as they apply to the USTRANSCOM/DoD supply chain enterprise.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM or any other Government agency in this area.<br /><br />These studies will investigate the capabilities and specialized features of various RMF tools applied to the USTRANSCOM enterprise, with emphasis on&nbsp; its Information Technology (IT) systems.&nbsp; The collaboration will enable prototype implementations and assessments of various RMF tools on at least one USTRANSCOM/federally-owned application/IT system.<br /><br />The Government's incumbent toolset is manually intensive and&nbsp; does not meet the new monitoring requirements of RMF.&nbsp; As a result, it is desirable for USTRANSCOM to find a tool that meets all needs and adds automation to improve productivity and efficiency, potentially reducing manpower costs and enhancing existing effectiveness and security for the DoD supply chain.<br /><br />Collaborators will provide resources for software licensing, installation, operations, and maintenance required for use of their RMF tool on USTRANSCOM systems, for demonstration and development purposes.<br /><br />USTRANSCOM will provide:<br /><br />1. The virtual and/or physical servers required as revealed by discussions between parties and as available from the Government.<br /><br />2. Access to pertinent Government systems of record as subjects for experimentation.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;Accessto Government Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).<br /><br />4.&nbsp;An assessment of the utility and limitations of th demonstrated toolsets.<br /><br />Small Businesses are encouraged to respond to this announcement.&nbsp; USTRANSCOM will give special consideration to small business firms and to business units located and that agree to manufacture substantially, in the United States IAW 15 U.S.C. Section 3710a(c)(4).<br /><br />Potential Collaborators may team with other qualified non-federal parties.<br /><br />Specific study outputs and any development and demonstration goals will be determined during discusssions with Collaborators prior to CRADA signatures, and refined as necessary during the life of the CRADAs.<br /><br />Multiple federal agencies may participate on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM, including but not limited to agencies of Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC, U.S. Army), Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), other Federal Laboratories, and other agencies of the U. S.Government, as USTRANSCOM deems appropriate.<br /><br />Supporting information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities should remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level.&nbsp; If classified information exchange is proposed by the Collaborator, Collaborator personnel must be appropriately cleared at the outset of the CRADA, at no cost of the Government.<br /><br />CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, provides personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources with or without reimbursement (but not funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property, or other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."&nbsp; More info on USTRANSCOM's use of CRADAs is found at http://www.transcom.mil/dbw/orta.cfm<br /><br />CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a one (1) year period, although duration can be tailored to suit the parties' needs before or even after work begins, by mutual agreement.<br /><br />USTRANSCOM and other designated Government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow).&nbsp; Based on response to the RFI's requested response elements and Government interest and capacity to enter into such agreements, USTRANSCOM&nbsp; will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers as basis for additional discussions, and so notify the respondents.<br /><br />Initial selection of white papers and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.&nbsp; <br /><br />After initial white paper selection, the Government will conduct discussions separately with each selected Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement on objectives, duration, intellectual property, and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA-based experiments.&nbsp; The Government may choose to visit pertinent facilities for a tour of Collaborator capabilities prior to final selections.<br /><br />No funding is available from the Government to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits or any other Collaborator costs of preparation for or participation in a CRADA.<br /><br />The USTRANSCOM template CRADA is attached to this RFI so potential Collaborators may understand its terms.&nbsp; The Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will draft and seek to finalize specific CRADA objectives and language collaboratively via discussions/mutual agreement after white paper selection.<br /><br />Interested parties may respond with 12 page white papers NLT 3 Feb 17 (11:59 Central time) by unclassified e-mail to <a href="mailto:transcom.scott.tcj5j4.mbx.orta@mail.mil">transcom.scott.tcj5j4.mbx.orta@mail.mil</a>by submitting an UNCLASSIFIED written white paper in the following format.&nbsp;
