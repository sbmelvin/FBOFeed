Statutory Basis for Other ThanFull and Open Competition:  10.U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	This is a follow on to an existing task order with the University of Toledo.  Thecontinued effort requires further development and enhancement of HyperSizer and NASAGlenns ImMAC software suite.The objective of this continued effort is to develop calibrated, verified and validatedstress analysis and life prediction methods incorporating variability in specificdeformation and life parameters to facilitate the safe and reliable utilization ofadvanced composites in aero-space structures.  Specifically, structures that use advancedfiber reinforced composites including, but not limited to, high temperature  ceramicmatrix composites (CMCs).  Major challenges are to adapt and extend existing methods (e.g. CEMCAN, WCEMCAN, ImMAC,and FE based approaches like PCgina) and database foundations generated under previousNASA programs and to establish a good understanding of key primary variables and issuesso that predications can be made with a specified level of confidence beyond the range ofexperimental conditions in the database.  By addressing these issues, the reliability ofweight and performance critical propulsion components can be improved.	Consequently, anadvanced knowledge of NASA GRC in-house codes such as CEMCAN and ImMAC are required.   Required period of performance:  March 15, 2010 through August 31, 2013.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement for two (2) vessels to conduct a bottom trawl survey of the groundfish resources of the continental shelf and slope of the United States West Coast region. Two commercial trawl-fishing vessels will be chartered to carry out this survey, operating in tandem. The two vessels will commence survey operations on or around August 16, 2010 and conclude survey operations approximately 74 days later on or around October 28, 2010. The charters will begin and end in Newport, Oregon, with survey operations proceeding from North to South. Each vessel will conduct an independent survey of the shelf and slope zone from 30 fathoms to 700 fathoms, extending from the Canadian border around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, California. Survey stations will be designated in the sampling manual to representatively sample this range of depths, and will be randomly pre-selected within a geographical area and depth strata. Both of the vessels will be allocated approximately 200 of these stations. This is to be a one-year contract with three additional one-year options (four years total). The vessel must be at least 65 feet in registered length. It must be seaworthy and suitable for trawling operations in the above region during the season indicated. The vessel's main engine must be rated at a minimum continuous horsepower of 450 and not rated more than 1200 horsepower. The vessel must be capable of towing the experimental gear at a minimum speed of 2.8 knots at a fishing depth of 700 fathoms (Description of fishing gear to be provided in solicitation). The vessel must be able to maintain a cruising speed of at least 8 knots in low sea states. The vessel must allow for thru-hull cabling for acoustic transducers that will be installed in dry dock. For vessels that do not have a steel hull, complete drawings of the location for transducer placement and any other necessary modifications to ensure hull integrity should be included in the proposal submission. At the end of charter period, transducers will be removed and the perforation will be doubly secured. The vessel must be equipped with a railing with a working height (from deck boards to top of rail) of no less than 40 inches (OSHA). Vessels with a working rail height exceeding 48 inches will be required to provide an overboard chute, or another means to discard fish overboard. The vessel must have clean and sanitary living conditions and adequate berthing accommodations for the vessel crew and four (4) scientists. A suitable desk, table, counter, or other work surface (approximately 4' X 3') must be available within the vessels' bridge where the scientific staff can set up the trawl instrumentation receiver, its display unit, gyrocompass, portable computer, and an external computational storage facility for logging trawl performance data and catch data. A stable source of 110 V, 60 cycle AC power must be available nearby as well as a convenient and accessible storage space for tools, notebooks, sampling forms and other frequently needed equipment and supplies.
<p>The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 532411 and the size standard is $7.0 million.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: N2011100030
NAICS CODE:  237990, Size Standard $33.5 Million.
GENERAL:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior (DOI), is soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. The solicitation will be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation. Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. The anticipated solicitation issue date will be on or about February 2 5, 2010. This procurement is offered as a Full and Open Competition, although the National Park Service encourages the participation of small business, disadvantaged,  and woman-owned business enterprises. 
DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The objective of the project is to reconstruct the failed dams on the East Cape Canal Extension and Homestead Canals with minimum impact on the surrounding natural conditions. The existing dams are in a remote area of the Everglades National Park near the southwest tip of mainland Florida in the Cape Sable area.  The canals are located just east and north of Lake Ingraham.  The entrance to the East Cape Canal in Florida Bay is located approximately 11 miles west of Flamingo, Fl. in Everglades National Park.  As a result of the sites remote locations, access routes to the East Cape Canal from landside and waterside staging areas are important and challenging aspects of facilitating construction at the dam sites.  The Permitted on-site construction window will be from October 1, 2010 until March 31, 2011 in order to avoid impacts to the nesting and mating season of the American Crocodiles which inhabit the area. The total period of performance will be a maximum of 284 days allowing for certain activities such as the pre-construction conference, erect ARRA signage, submittal submission and approval, etc. prior to the October 1, 2010 on-site start-work date. All work will be performed under a single prime contract.
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a Technical Proposal (including past performance information) and a Business & Price Proposal. LARGE BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A SUBCONTRACTING PLAN. The Government will consider an offeror's technical capability, past performance, and price to determine the best value to the Government applying a trade-off process. 
MAGNITUDE OF PROJECT:  Project magnitude range between $6,000,000 and $9,000,000.  
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Time for completion will be approximately 284 calendar days. It is anticipated that the notice to proceed will be issued during June 2010, with an expected completion date of March 31, 2011. 
SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  On or about Thursday, February 25, 2010. 
(ANTICIPATED) PROPOSAL SUBMISSION DATE:  The proposal submission due date is on or about Monday March 29, 2010. Offers will be considered from all responsible and responsive offerors. All offerors are required to submit a Bid Bond (SF 24).
PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE and SITE VISIT:  8 AM Tuesday March 9, 2010. All interested prime and subcontractors interested in bidding on the above project are encouraged to attend the site visit and pre-proposal conference starting 8 AM Tuesday March 9, 2010 at the Flamingo Marina, 50 miles from Homestead/Florida City, in Everglades National Park. All parties will be responsible for their own boat transportation to the Cape Sable sites. It is highly encouraged to use professional guide fishermen already permitted by the National Park Service given the shallow waters and strong currents in Florida Bay and near the sites. The two construction sites, East Cape Canal and Homestead Canal, are very narrow and in shallow water, so access will be limited.  
1) All boats have to be in the water at the Flamingo Marina, Florida Bay side, by 8 AM. 2) At 8:30 there will be a brief organizational meeting with all boat operators and contractors before departure. 3) At 9 AM the Park rangers will lead the boat convoy from the Flamingo Marina, bay side, 11 miles to the East Cape Canal.  4) We will split up contractors into two groups, one going to East Cape, the other to Homestead. Each group will rotate to each site. 5) Contractors will anchor at a designated area at the mouth of the East Cape site and be transferred to two NPS boats. Due to limited access to the construction site, the NPS will transport 3 to 4 people per boat to the site and back to the staging area. 6) We will follow the same process, concurrently, at the Homestead Site.7) There will be no questions and answers during the site visit, a separate meeting will be held with all contractors later in the day. 8) We anticipate that the above process will be complete and the convoy will be back at the Flamingo Marina by 2 - 3 PM. 9) All parties will then travel back to the Main Everglades Visitor Center, off the main park road, inside the park entrance, approximately 35 miles from Flamingo by 4:30 to 5 PM. 10) There the NPS will conduct a brief presentation and then will open the meeting to questions. All questions will need to be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing after the meeting. 11) The meeting will adjourn no later than 6:30 PM.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals.  This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (wwww.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing this requirement.  The contractor shall reconfigure the spillway gates according to the contract plans (to be provided with solicitation)to provide access to both the TSW1 crest, the TSW2 crest, the TSW2 leaf support frame, and the TSW2 downstream leaf. In order to obtain access to the TSW2 crest it is first necessary to remove the TSW2 downstream components. Currently TSW1 and 2 are located in spillbay19 and 20.  These components are not readily suitable for highway transport without some disassembly. As a result the contractor shall take these components to a McNary provided work site for disassembly. When originally constructed, a special bottom seal assembly was fabricated and installed on the bottom of one upper spillway gate leaf for use in suspending flow over the TSW2 crest. This seal assembly shall also be removed from the gate at the disassembly site. The contractor shall then haul the downstream TSW2 components and the seal assembly offsite for disposal.<BR><BR>With the TSW2 downstream components out of the way, the contractor shall then reconfigure the spillway gates to provide access to the TSW1 and TSW2 crest pieces. The contractor shall take those crest pieces and place them in two upstream spillway gate slots provided by McNary. Finally the contractor shall reconfigure the TSW spillbays to provide for normal spillway operation. The TSW and spillway gate components are large and heavy and not conducive to manipulate with a mobile crane.  McNary will provide contractor access to a spillway crane.<BR>This announcement is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a comitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.<BR>

<DESC>The Project Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PM UAS) seeks your comments and suggestions pertaining to an Analysis of Alternatives to help define a programmatic approach to closing gaps defined by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  On September 27, 2009, the Army approved a Material Development Decision (MDD) and authorization to begin an Analysis of Alternatives which will look at manned, unmanned, and Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming solutions to meet the required capability.  The Armed Aerial Scout Program Office and the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Management Office will provide a manned, unmanned or manned/unmanned platform solution that conducts armed reconnaissance, attack, and security missions to enable joint/combined air-ground maneuver of mobile strike, close combat and vertical maneuver operations across the full spectrum of military operations.<BR><BR>PM-UAS seeks your comments and suggestions on how to accomplish the specific tactical capability requirements using either or both of two systems concepts:<BR><BR>1.  In one concept, the entire set of tactical capabilities is performed using solely unmanned platforms.  This concept may utilize single vehicle architectures similar to those currently used by the Army or it could be approached with multiple, collaborative intelligent air vehicles if the appropriate considerations of airspace integration, interoperability, frequency management and unit integration are made.<BR><BR>2.  In the second concept, Manned-Unmanned (MUM) teaming is the fundamental operating mode, and the tactical capabilities are achieved by teaming either existing manned rotary winged assets, or new manned assets and unmanned assets as best suited to achieving the tactical capabilities in the specified organizational and operational environment.<BR><BR>More detailed information regarding this Request for Information is provided in the attached document.  The requested information is required by March 10, 2010.  Due to time constraints, it is not possible to extend this response date.<BR><BR>NOTE: This notice is not a Request for Proposals.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to design,manufacture, install, and test a modified anti-icing system for the NASA Super Guppyaircraft designated as NASA 941.BackgroundThe Super Guppy was designed by Aero Spacelines, Inc. (ASI) in the late 1960's and NASA941 was built in the late 1970's.  ASI used parts from the Boeing C-97 Stratocruiser, theLockheed P-3 Orion, the Boeing 707 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules.  NASA 941 has two separate anti-icing systems:  an engine bleed air system and a thermalsystem.  The engine bleed system uses 14th stage engine bleed air mixed with ambient wingcavity air by piccolo devices to provide anti-icing air to each inboard wing then ventsoverboard.  The 14th stage air is also ducted to the empennage and mixed with ambientempennage cavity air by two ejectors to provide anti-icing to the vertical and horizontaltail leading edges then vents overboard.The thermal system uses three combustion burners in each outboard engine nacelle to heatram air from intakes in each outboard wing.  The mixed air is ducted to passageways ineach outboard wing and then vented at each wing tip.  For safety reasons, the heaters forthe outboard wings have been removed and covers have been installed over each wing's ramair intake.Statement of WorkModify NASA 941 by replacing the thermal anti-icing system for the outboard wings with ableed air system.  The following tasks will be required to accomplish the modification:1) Design heat exchangers and distribution system to mix ram air with 14th stage enginebleed air to provide anti-icing for each outboard wing.  Utilize existing ducts andpassageways as much as possible.2) Modify design of the anti-icing control system as necessary to account for the newconfiguration.3) Manufacture or purchase all required material.4) Install modified system.5)Remove covers from ram air intakes and conduct testing to verify that the modifiedsystem can maintain a wing leading edge temperature between 20 degrees Celcius and 105degrees Celsius.6)Verify that the installation is sound considering structural and thermal stresses.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements areinvited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references to thelisted points of contact.Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.

<DESC>Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.<br /><br />The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, intends to award a Brand Name Only Purchase Order on a Limited Source basis to Laerdal or their distributor American Medical Depot to provide the required SimMan 3G. In addition to the SimMan 3G, this requirement includes assembly and expert training on the whole project, a one-day installation service followed by a two-day training session. The two-day session consists of simulator assembly, software installation, and programming. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38, Effective 1 February and class deviation 2009-O0009. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 339112 and the size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />There are currently two simulation products that are being used by the Air Force including Meti-Man and SimMan. The 10 MDG has personnel trained on an older model of the SimMan where future training is readily available and most of the staff is already well-informed of the procedures. The Meti-Man requires an innate knowledge of blood values requiring an expert to manage while also requiring additional gases (Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc.). This platform is more cumbersome for training; it is geared more for critical care training than what is required at this facility to execute the mission. The SimMan 3G is most compatible with the current system and provides all the necessary functions needed for training.<br /><br />The SimMan 3G that we are requesting offers a tether-less flexibility to perform simulation-based education in any environment. This will enable the facility to exercise patient safety, mock code blue, Readiness Skills Verifications, along with 3 other life support programs in various locations throughout the facility. This mannequin is solely suited for the required needs as there is no requirement for critical care applications yet there is a requirement for a multisystem trauma platform. It allows training of physicians, nurses, medical technicians regardless of the availability of patients with medical conditions that are needed to properly train these personnel. They will be used for medical readiness and pre-deployment training. These simulations can meet the 87% of Physician RSVs, 97% of nursing RSVs, and 87% of technician RSVs. The ability of 10 MDG to properly train its personnel is impacted by decreasing patient case mix as well as regulatory such as the new 80-hr resident workweek. Additionally, the SimMan is user friendly to operate, is easily programmable on the fly and requires no gas source.<br /><br />Delivery is to be made to the 10th Medical Group at the U.S. Air Force Academy, CO.<br />FOB: Destination. <br />Unique Item Identifier (UID) [DFARS 252.211] applies to this requirement.<br /><br />This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME. <br />Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the SimMan 3G or can provide the brand name product may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can either provide an equal product or they are an authorized distributor/wholesaler for the SimMan 3G. It is the offeror's responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement, and/or a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist or a determination to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received 12:00 pm MST on 02/17/2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement.

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, intends to award a Brand Name Only Purchase Order on a Sole Source basis to Lumenis, Inc. to provide the required Lumenis Selecta II Laser. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38, Effective 1 February and class deviation 2009-O0009. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 339112 and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The SLT laser used to treat glaucoma is becoming the highest standard for laser trabeculoplastry surgery. It is a patented device with no competitor in the same class. Argon Laser Trabeculoplastry (ALT) is an older procedure using the argon laser that is less effective with a higher complication. Selective Laser Trabeculoplastry (SLT) is safer and more effective than Argon Laser Trabeculoplastry. In addition SLT is repeatable if needed while ALT is not. SLT is less harmful than ALT when preserving the trabecular meshwork. The main difference between the ALT and SLT relate mainly to retreatment's and patient safety. ALT results in cumulative destructing and fibrosis of the trabecular meshwork, but SLT does not structurally alter it. SLT preserves the ocular tissue. Lumenis has provided a letter stating that Lumenis is the only company in the United States to offer this revolutionary glaucoma treatment modality. Research shows they hold the patent for this type of equipment. For this reason, the USAFA intends to purchase the Lumenis Selecta II Laser.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO EA ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, &amp; TECHNOLOGY, 221 SUN VALLEY BLVD, SUITE D, LINCOLN, NE 68528.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) posts this notice of intent to issue a contract to EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology for services to prepare a comprehensive design drawing, specifications, construction cost estimates, calculations and other follow-up and related services, including preparation of the bid package and perform construction inspection services during construction for the Replacement of NOAA/NMFS Laboratory Sea Water Intake/Delivery System at Galveston, TX. The AE will also be responsible to provide the detail Topographic survey.</p>
<p>In September 2009, NOAA awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Number DG133F-08-BU-0043/C003, against GSA Schedule GS10F0228J to EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology of Lincoln, NE for Geotechnical/Engineering Consulting Services for the Analysis of Sea Water Intake and Delivery System Options to support the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Galveston Laboratory. The current requirement for services to prepare a comprehensive design drawing, specifications, construction cost estimates, calculations and other follow-up and related services, including preparation of the bid package and perform construction inspection services during construction is essentially follow-on work to the work that EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology of Lincoln, NE performed under BPA Number DG133F-08-BU-0043/C003, against GSA Schedule GS10F0228J, which expired in December 2009. To consider sources other than EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the project completion schedule. A Contractor other than EA Engineering, Science &amp; Technology would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology, 221 Sun Valley Blvd., Suite D, Lincoln, NE 68528.</p>

<p><strong>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME</strong>: AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY, MUNITIONS DIRECTORATE, CONTRACTING DIVISION (AFRL/RWK), EGLIN AFB, FLORIDA</p>
<p><strong>BAA TITLE</strong>: ROBUST FUZEWELL INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM</p>
<p><strong>BAA TYPE</strong>: INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p><strong>BAA NUMBER</strong>: BAA-RWK-10-0004</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME</strong>: White papers are due by 2:00 PM Central Time on 30 March 2010. Deliver to: AFRL/RWK, ATTN: Ms Melissa Campbell, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810. White Papers received after this due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). See Section IV for additional information. It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late."

<p>I. <strong>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong>:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK) is soliciting White Papers for the Fuzes Branch (AFRL/RWMF) on the following research effort: Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS). It is anticipated approximately two of the White Papers may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating one contract for the RFIS program. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Introduction</strong>: The Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS) program will develop an instrumentation package that will replace the fuze inside a penetrator weapon for both sled and flight tests. The RFIS will house a minimum of two (2) internal data recorders that will be used to measure and record deceleration data in testing of penetrating weapons. Such tests have high value and a need exists for a reliable alternative to existing methods which have proven to be inadequate. The RFIS technology program will provide increased reliability by providing the platform for multiple data recorders to be housed within the volume of a standard 3" bomb fuzewell.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Program Objective</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Program Objective</span>: The objective of this task is to design and develop a non-proprietary Robust Fuzewell Instrumentation System (RFIS) which can be fabricated at relatively low cost in a repeatable fashion. The RFIS will be strictly an instrumentation item and will replace the fuze inside a penetrator weapon for both sled and flight tests. Generally the primary data recorder is placed inside the fuze body. These recorders are hand-assembled units which are generally put together just prior to the tests because of battery limitations. Additionally, these recorders have generally used volatile memory which requires excavation and recovery of the data recorder within 30 days. Depending upon the range restrictions, target characteristics and depth of penetration this may not always be possible. Also, for flight tests, the flight profiles of the test aircraft have to be restricted because previous data recorders have not had temperature compensation circuits.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Program Objective</span>: The instrumentation system will be comprised of existing state-of-the-art harsh environment data recorders with sensors, power supply, interface control module, and carrier package. This system will house a minimum of two (2) independent internal data recorders with a goal of three (3) independent internal data recorders that will be used to measure and record deceleration data in testing of penetrating weapons. Such tests have high value and a need exists for a reliable alternative to existing methods which have proven to be inadequate. The RFIS program will provide increased reliability by providing the platform for multiple data recorders to be housed within the volume of a standard 3" bomb fuzewell. Prior data recorders have shown a moderately high failure rate during sled tests and an unacceptably high failure rate (&gt;50%) during actual weapon flight tests when used in penetration experiments into either rock or concrete. These tests are extremely expensive and cannot always be repeated due to fiscal constraints. The deceleration data is required to accurately model and predict the penetration capability of current and future weapons and to determine the limits of fuze and weapon survivability.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> The RFIS design will contain multiple data recorders for redundancy and maintain the general form factor of the FMU-152 fuze to fit into current penetrator weapons. In conjunction with the development of the RFIS, tests should evaluate RFIS activation schemes for both sled and flight tests as well as impact survivability. The design shall be modular with cavities to fit multiple data recorders within and electrically interface with them for power, communications and any other necessary functions. Develop an Interface Control Drawing (DI-CMAN-81248A) to document mechanical and electrical requirements for both the overall RFIS as well as the internal recorder modules, plug-and-play compatibility with multiple internal data recorders, etc. The interface module shall incorporate the FMU-152 electrical interface and will communicate with the weapon system within the limitations of the FMU-152 electrical interface to provide information such as health check, system activation, and any other necessary functions. The RFIS external dimensions shall be established to allow installation within the standard 3" fuzewell of penetrating weapons (e.g. BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-122, Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP)) and maintain compatibility with weapon systems which incorporate existing (e.g., FMU-143, FMU-152) and future fuzes (e.g., Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF)). The RFIS shall be secured within the fuzewell sufficiently to prevent movement within the fuzewell and warhead base plate through the target penetration event. Develop protocols for data recorder activation, functional testing, and impact survivability demonstration. Develop Finite Element (FE) model of RFIS for shock loading analysis and test predictions. Develop and breadboard interface module architecture. Information for interfacing with existing recorders is contained in the Annex. Other technical information is also contained in the Annex. Certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is required to be submitted to the Program Manager and the Contract Specialist in order to receive the Annex. Once a certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is received, then the contractor will receive access to the Annex. See paragraph I(11)(d) for further details on how to request the Annex.</p>
<p>(4) <strong>Program Tasking</strong>: The program is anticipated to include design, analysis, modeling and simulation, software development, test plans, prototype hardware fabrication and delivery, bench testing, laboratory shock testing, and cannon launched penetrator shock testing, sled and flight testing.</p>

<p>(1) <strong>White Paper Evaluation Criteria</strong>: White Papers will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk assessment</span> (See section/paragraph V(3)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> (1.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance</strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Soundness of offeror's proposed RFIS Concept, proposed development, and producibility approach<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to conducting the design<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to performing test, evaluation and assessment of the design<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(1.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations of these subfactors, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the White Paper page limits. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(1.3) Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the third order of priority.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Proposal Evaluation Criteria</strong>: Proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk assessment</span> (See Section V(4)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(2.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance</strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Soundness and scope of offeror's proposed technical approach and&nbsp;&nbsp; consistency with good systems engineering practices for development, testing, and future low cost custom fabrication.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Extent to which the offeror demonstrates that the defined requirements (See Section I(3)) can be accomplished with the proposed technology<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Scope, traceability and feasibility of proposed analysis and test plans</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Experience and capabilities may include unique combinations of the subfactors above, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Experience should be relevant to the tasks identified in this BAA, to include; design and development of instrumentation systems. The government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2.3) Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs. Cost realism includes evaluating if the proposed cost is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the unique methods of performance and material described in the offeror's technical proposal. The total cost to be evaluated will include the cost of performing the contract, and any applicable offsets for GFP or acquisition of data rights.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>White Paper/Proposal Risk Assessment</strong>: White Paper/Proposal risk will be assessed at each Factor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. White Paper/Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.1) <strong>High</strong>: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.2) <strong>Moderate</strong>: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3.3) <strong>Low</strong>: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(4) No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual White Paper/Proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other White Papers and Proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>(5) <strong>Review and Selection Process</strong>: Should formal proposals be requested based on the evaluation of White Papers, those technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time, using the same criteria stated above, and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category I</span></strong>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category II</span></strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Category III</span></strong>: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br /><br /><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</strong>:<br />(1) <strong>Selection Notices for White Papers</strong>: Those White Papers evaluated in accordance with sections/paragraphs V(1) and V(3) and determined to be of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span> <strong>may</strong> be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the contracting or technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those White Papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their White Paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Award Notices for Proposals</strong>: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. The Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Administrative and National Policy Requirements</strong>: The offeror will require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.<br /><br />(4) <strong>Data Rights Assertions</strong>: Any data delivered or anticipated to be delivered with less than unlimited rights must be reported in a separate, appropriately marked appendix to the final report of any awarded contract resulting from this BAA.<br /><br />(5) <strong>Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)</strong>: Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP. If required, as a part of a resulting contract from this BAA, AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9001 mandates that adequate health and safety requirements be identified in the contract.

<p>VIII. <strong>OTHER INFORMATION</strong>:</p>
<p>(1)<strong> Communication</strong>: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged <strong>until submission of White Papers</strong>. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />(2) <strong>Debriefings</strong>: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). <br /><br />(3) <strong>Wide Area Work Flow Notice</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.<br /><br />(4) <strong>Item Identification and Valuation</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the Government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the Government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above.

Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. <BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR>Local Contract Provisions and Clauses pertaining to this solicitation in full text as follows:<BR><BR>CCE 225-4000 AUTHORIZATION TO PERFORM SERVICES IN GERMANY (MAR 2005) <BR><BR>Contractors performing services in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) shall comply with German law.  The Contractor shall determine whether performance requires registration with German authorities or authorization to do business in Germany and, if so, shall comply with all requirements.  Whether or not registration or authorization to do business is required, the Contractor also shall determine what documents or authorization its employees and any subcontractor employees must possess to work in Germany.  The Contractor shall ensure affirmatively that its employees and subcontractor employees possess such documents or authorizations.  Contractor employees who:<BR><BR>(a) are not nationals of Germany or other European Union countries, and<BR><BR>(b) are not members of the force, the civilian component or their dependents, and<BR><BR>(c) do not have assimilated status under Articles 71, 72, or 73 of the Supplementary Agreement to the NATO SOFA, <BR><BR>shall possess work- and residence-permits.  By acceptance of and performance under this contract and any task orders or delivery orders issued hereunder, the Contractor affirms that it has complied with the requirements above.  Compliance with this clause and German law is a material contract requirement.

Failure to submit required information/data and obtain required documentation or clearances in accordance with AE Regulation 190-16, Installation Access Control, will be grounds for denying access to U.S. installations and controlled areas.  The Contractor is responsible to ensure that any Subcontractor used in performance of this contract complies with these requirements and that all employees, of both the Contractor and any Subcontractor utilized by the contractor, are made aware of and comply with these requirements.<BR><BR>(b) The Contractor is responsible for being aware of and complying with the requirements associated with Installation Access Control.  The Government is not liable for any costs associated with performance delays due solely to a firms failure to comply with Installation Access Control (IAC) processing requirements.<BR><BR>(c)  The Contractor is responsible for returning installation passes to the issuing Installation Access Control Office (IACO) when the contract is completed or when a contractor employee no longer requires access.<BR><BR>(d) AE 190-16 (and AE 190-16-G German translation) can be found on the following website:<BR><BR>http://www.ecc-e.army.mil/  under the library link<BR><BR>(e) Below is the responsible Organizational Sponsor & Installation Access Control Office for this contract:<BR><BR>Organizational Sponsor:	<BR>Location: 		<BR>Building No: 		<BR>DSN Phone No: 		<BR>Commercial Phone No: 	<BR><BR>Installation Access Control Offices: <BR><BR>Location:   Grafenwoehr <BR>Building No: 			244, Room 134<BR>DSN Phone No: 			475-8414/8415<BR>Commercial Phone No: 		+49 9641 83 8414/8415<BR><BR>Location:  Hohenfels<BR>(0730  1130 hours)<BR>Building No: 		770<BR>DSN Phone No:		466-4015<BR>Commercial Phone No:	+49 9472 83 4015<BR><BR>(1230 - 1600 hours)<BR>Building No:		10<BR>DSN Phone No:		466-4029<BR>Commercial Phone No: 	+49 9472 83 4029<BR><BR>CCE.233-4002	AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (December 2008)<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Addendum to 52.212-1(c), Period for Acceptance of Offers. The paragraph is tailored as follows: "The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers."</p>
<p>52.212-1 Proposal Contents/Required Information</p>
<p>a. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the offers, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. The quotes/responses must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. To be eligible for award the offeror's response to the RFQ must include both PRICE and PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION as described below.</p>
<p>b. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.</p>
<p>1. PRICE INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Insert proposed UNIT and EXTENDED prices for all Contract Line Items (CLINS) listed above. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units. Include any pertinent information regarding industry standards that may be applicable. <br />b. Either complete Representations and Certifications in ORCA at https://orca.bpn.gov or the necessary fill-ins and certifications in provisions FAR 52.212-3. If FAR 52.212-3 is completed in hard copy it shall be returned along with the contractor's proposal.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survery will be provided to the references that you provide. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications to include other type of bags with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the specifications to include other type of bags with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in <br />accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, when determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, credentials, magnitude of work (meaning size of church, number of choirs, breadth of experience), flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs, ability of contractor to work and respond kindly to various types of people, and the ability to respond to needs that are specific to the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performnace information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.</p>

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Ken Nadeau is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: NE Marine Support Facility, 166 Water Street, Woods Hole, MA.</p>
<p>b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

Quality Assurance IndicatorsMeasures to insure the quality and effectiveness of remediation shall be undertaken by the contractor in accordance with IICRC-S520. Evaluations during, as well as after remediation, shall be conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the work. At a minimum the following quality assurance indicators should be followed and documented:"	Isolation of the work areas was appropriate and effective"	Mold removal and worksite cleanup was performed according to the site-specific work plan"	Any additional moisture or mold damage discovered during remediation was properly addressed"	Upon completion of remediation, surfaces are free from visible dust and debris"	Sampling and lab results are evaluated by a trained building or environmental health professional.Work PlanBuilding #376 (Morey), #380 (Cunningham), # 381 (Potts), #383 (Young), #562 (Dooley)    The structures are single story residential buildings that are approximately twelve hundred (1,200) square feet. Some have an unfinished basement and some have a crawlspace.  The crawlspace is accessed through a floor opening in a pantry closet in the building. There is some debris and insulation throughout the crawlspace. Moderate fungal growth was observed on the rim joists and random spotty fungal growth was observed on the subfloor and floor joists. An indoor air quality test was completed in the kitchen area.1.	For crawlspace/basement cleaning (to be completed before commencing living space cleaning):"	All insulation, non structural wood debris, existing vapor barriers, and paper product debris will be removed from the crawl space, encapsulated with 6-mil polyethylene and removed from the park and properly disposed."	All visible fungal growth shall be vacuumed/scrubbed with a stiff bristle brush to remove the fungal colonies. These areas should then be treated with an antimicrobial cleaning product containing quaternary ammonium chloride. "	A clearance inspection will be performed prior to installation of the vapor barrier and insulation. "	Install a vapor barrier consisting of 6-mil fire retardant polyethylene sheeting with all seams sealed to each other and covering 24 inches up the crawl space walls."	At rim joists insulate with 4 inches of rigid, spray-applied polyurethane foam that is a standard polyurethane, 2-component mix for producing rigid, closed-cell insulation, after approval by NPS.
2.	For living space: "	All visible fungal growth, as well as behind bathroom fixture panels, shall be vacuumed/scrubbed with a stiff bristle brush to remove the fungal colonies. "	All carpet(s) and pad(s) shall be cleaned using a steam, deep-extraction method."	All upholstered (fabric) furnishings, all surfaces from the floor to the ceiling shall be inspected, HEPA-vacuumed and then wiped down with soap and water and/or a biocide containing quaternary ammonium chloride. "	Air scrubbers should be run at all times during the cleaning process. The air scrubbers will be vented to the outside. "	The air quality will be retested after the unit is cleaned and the results will be compared to the outside air to verify completeness of the cleaning.
3.	HVAC System"	If it exists, remove all insulation surrounding the HVAC system components and discard the insulation in the same manner as other material in the crawl space."

However, given the unique circumstances presented by the ongoing major East Coast snowstorm and the possibility of transportation delays, we are modifying the proposal delivery requirement for this solicitation as follows:</p>
<p>If a proposer can show that a proposal is delivered to the carrier in time to ensure delivery to ATI prior to the deadline under normal circumstances, and weather prevents the carrier from meeting their normal delivery time standard, the technical and cost proposals must be submitted electronically to ingram@aticorp.org prior to the deadline, in order to be accepted. The tracking number provided by the carrier for the affected proposal(s) must also be submitted to ingram@aticorp.org to provide evidence of timely acceptance by the carrier. In this situation, the hard copy proposals will be accepted whenever the carrier is able to deliver them to ATI.</p>

Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good<BR>Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal<BR>Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.

Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating:<BR>Risk rating<BR>Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk<BR>Very high quality past performance.

Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk<BR>Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk<BR>Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.

There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.

Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Above Average Risk<BR>Very little of past experience. Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk<BR>Unacceptable amount of past experience. Experience was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral<BR>No current and/or relevant experience record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Experience information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR><BR>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Armys Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Armys current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to Additional Info located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents.                                                                                                                       <BR>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Armys LNA Compliance requirements. <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendors assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendors certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

<ARCHDATE>06182010
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Email christopher.glista@darpa.mil
<DESC>This amendment revises BAA Section II "Summary of Proposal," paragraph C (p.23). "Payable" in the third sentence has been replaced by "critical." The paragraph now reads as follows:
<p>"Cost, schedule, and measurable milestones for the proposed research, including estimates of cost for each milestone in each year of the effort delineated by the prime and major subcontractors, total cost and company cost share, if applicable. Measurable milestones should capture key development points in tasks and should be clearly articulated and defined in time relative to start of effort. These critical milestones should enable assessment of progress throughout each phase of the effort. Additional interim non-critical management milestones are also highly encouraged at a regular interval (at least monthly)."</p>
<p>This above change has been incorporated into DARPA-BAA-10-20, Rev. 2 which is provided as an attachment to this amendment. The rest of the text of the BAA remains unchanged.</p>

<DESC>NOTE:&nbsp; Changes for amendment 0002 are in section (a) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE.&nbsp; Please substitute the following paragraph for that section:&nbsp; This is the only change for amendment 0002. <br /><br />[AMEND 0002](a) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE:&nbsp; (Ensure that all special experience requirements are reflected on appropriate peresonnel resumes at Section E, Part I, SF 330 and all SF 330 submittals are numbered to correspond to the numbering shown in this synopsis-type in the requirement and then type in your response).&nbsp; Firms must document significant recent experience (within the past 5 years) in supplying personnel to perform work on a variety of sites within the timeframe required.&nbsp; Demonstrate a&nbsp;maximum of ten examples within the past 5 years.&nbsp; Firms must demonstrate the ability to provide personnel for a full range of professional services to include, but not limited to:&nbsp; project managers, experienced cost engineers, registered and non-registered civil engineers, registered and non-registered mechanical engineers, registered and non registered electric engineers, NAS schedulers, certified value engineers, and geologist or soils engineers.[AMEND 0002].&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<br />a. General: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <br /><br />The proposed A-E contract will support the construction of an approximately $1B Hospital located at Ft Hood, Texas and could include CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<br /><br />This announcement is open only to SMALL BUSINESSES. The prime A-E firm must perform 50% or more of the work on this contract. Anticipated contract award will be on or about May 2010. One Indefinite Delivery Contract(IDC) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $20,000,000 with a minimum guarantee amount of $5,000.00 only for the base period of 2 years with 3 year options and for a term not to exceed five years. <br /><br />Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<br /><br />Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. There will be NO design services included in this contract.<br /><br />Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<br /><br />b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order. Personnel provided by this contract will operate out of Government supplied facilities.<br /><br />c. Contract Award Procedure: <br />The proposed services will be obtained by Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov .<br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Construction phase services are required to support construction activities and may include tasks supporting projects not yet in construction. Projects are anticipated to be primarily in support of Fort Worth District/Southwestern Division U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Ft Hood, Texas. However, Task Orders under resultant IDC contract may on a limited basis be awarded by SWF for use in other Corps of Engineer Districts, other DOD or other Federal agencies for projects anywhere in the US or its territories. Required services include a broad range of engineering and construction activities including (but not limited to) assistance and guidance to field offices, project management, construction QA inspection and reporting, review of contract documents and shop drawings, review of NAS schedules and QC plans, and investigation and reporting of construction contractor claims. The firm selected will be required to provide personnel on site from 1 to 5 years. The maximum numbers of assignees are estimated to be 35 personnel simultaneously. <br /><br />3.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NETWORK 22 LOGISTICS OFFICEJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONFAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) "PURCHASE OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SYSTEM"1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as requested by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS), will enter into a supply contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Sole source contractor shall provide a SuperDimension medical equipment system to the VAGLAHS under the terms and conditions of a supply contract.3. Description of Requirement: VAGLAHS is requesting a sole source service contract from SuperDimension Inc. The period of performance is February 22, 2010 through February 21, 2011. The estimated for cost for the system is $168,065.00. 4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The service is being procured under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR Part 6.302-1 (c) (1). 5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The SuperDimension medical equipment is an endoscopic system which uses electromagnetic navigation bronchoscope to allow for biopsy of peripheral lung lesions, and mediastinal nodes as well as placement of dye and radio surgical markers. It uses software which imports CT scans and creates a virtual three (3) dimensional image for case planning.  During the procedure an adaptor is attached to the bronchoscope through which a guide is passed and navigated to the lesion.  After the lesion is located, the guide is pulled out and tools are advanced for biopsy. The Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy system must be capable of using CT and PET scans matched to patients to guide a steerable catheter to peripheral lesions and mediastinal nodes.  The catheter must relay information showing location, position and distance to designated targets. This catheter is able to accept standard bronchoscopic biopsy tools and work with current therapeutic bronchoscopes.  SuperDimension Inc. is the only company with access from inside the tracheobronchial tree.   Furthermore, without this equipment, it would have a negative impact on the health and welfare of the veteran patients and could lead to death. 6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See item Number 5 above.  A notice was transmitted to the GPE (FedBizOpps) from February 1 through February 8, 2010 and I received no responses.7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost should be fair and reasonable to the government based on the using service estimate. 8. Results of Market Survey: Market research information was also obtained through the GSA website before this procurement was posted on www.fedbizopps.gov.  SuperDimension Inc. is not on the Federal Supply Schedule and is currently in the process of obtaining a contract through the National Acquisition Center. See Item Number 5 above. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NETWORK 22 LOGISTICS OFFICEJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONFAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)""PURCHASE OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SYSTEM"9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Item Number 6 above.10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that expressed in writing an interest in the service.  11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: The anticipated life of the Government Equipment is estimated to be twenty (20) years. The Government plans to maintain this equipment for the next twenty years to maximize usage of the system. In order to overcome barriers to competition, the Government shall research other medical equipment before the procurement of a new system. 12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Monica Griffin					 Contracting Officer
