Description of Services:

The Contractor shall provide all labor, supplies, equipment, maintenance, information technology, and supervision necessary to provide comprehensive genomic profile services.  Genetic Laboratory services include, but are not limited to: specimen storage; transportation of clinical laboratory specimens; performance of analytical testing; reporting of analytical test results; and consultative services.

The two types of testing shall provide a fully informative genomic profile for hematologic cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma) sarcomas and pediatric cancers, designed to provide physicians with clinically accountable information to guide treatment options for patients based on the genomic profile of their cancer.  

Comprehensive Genomic Biomarker (Next Generation Sequencing) to Predict Response to
Immunotherapy for Hematologic Cancers

Comprehensive Genomic Biomarker (Next Generation Sequencing) to Predict Response to
Immunotherapy for Solid Tumor

The comprehensive genomic profile shall apply next-generation sequencing to identify all four types of genomic alterations across all genes known to be unambiguous drivers of solid tumors with high accuracy.  The test simultaneously sequences the coding region of 315 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer to a typical median depth of coverage of greater than 500X.  Each covered read represents a unique DNA fragment to enable the highly sensitive and specific detection of genomic alterations that occur at low frequencies due to tumor heterogeneity, low tumor purity and small tissue samples.   The test shall detect all classes of genomic alterations, including base substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels), copy number  alterations (CNAs), and rearrangements using a small, routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample (including core or fine needle biopsies).  

General Qualifications:

Only fully licensed/accredited laboratories actively engaged in providing the specific services and laboratory testing outlined in this solicitation shall be considered.  The Contractor shall have all licenses, permits, accreditation and certificates required by law.  The reference laboratory shall be licensed/accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).  In addition, the laboratory must be certified as meeting the requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988.
