<DESC>The opportunity presented by the BAA is to perform research that enables Naval Transformation.  The Naval Transformation Roadmap (NTR) provided at the KSA FNC web site [https://ksafnc.spawar.navy.mil/]  describes the vision of the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, and Commandant of the Marine Corps for Naval Transformation and should be carefully reviewed by potential Offerors.  Offerors should clearly explain how the proposed research effort contributes to transformative capability.  Offerors should also address other issues described in the BAA, such as transition of technology to Naval acquisition programs. 
Projects that are currently being executed as a result of KSA FNC Block 1 project selection are listed on the KSA FNC web site.  Potential Offerors should refer to the current projects to ensure they do not propose research that would duplicate already funded research efforts.
The Office of Naval Research is responsible for technology support that helps execute Sea Power 21 as described in the NTR.  Potential Offerors are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the NTR because the contribution of proposed technology to Naval Transformation is the highest priority evaluation criterion.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) re-announces its program to recognize distinguished academic ocean scientists through the establishment of awards of duration of four years for research ?Chairs?.

Each award will include four years of support for one Research Chair and at least two graduate students. Recipients of ?Chair? awards will be internationally known leaders in their fields with collaborations across many science areas and sponsoring agencies.

<DESC>Description:

Economic progress in the Philippines has been impeded by population pressure.  The imbalance in population and economic growth is a significant factor in the continuing prevalence of absolute and relative poverty and the failure to attain the desired levels of health improvements.  As a consequence, infectious and communicable diseases, particularly tuberculosis, remain significant health problems, even as degenerative diseases are rising and increasing in significance. Studies show that it will be very difficult for the Philippines to achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for poverty reduction even if the economy achieves its medium term economic growth targets unless a concerted population management program is put in place to check the prevailing high population growth rate. Family planning and health programs in the Philippines are provided by local government units (LGUs) as mandated under the Philippine Local Government Code. However, these LGUs still lack the necessary management capability, technical skills and resources to effectively serve the poor in their communities.

In support of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRPs) efforts, USAID/Philippines proposes to implement a Health Enhancing Local Partnerships (H.E.L.P) program under its Strategic Objective of  Desired family size and improved health sustainably achieved. The solicitation, when issued, will seek proposals to provide technical assistance to strengthen the Local Government Units (LGUs) delivery and management of services for family planning, maternal and child health, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS preventive measures. In particular, the program will support the intermediate results (IR) 1 and 4,of the above Strategic Objective: LGU provision and management of FP/MCH/TB/HIV/AIDS services strengthened and Policy Environment and Financing for Provision of Services Improved, respectively, and their sub-intermediate results.  The program will be comprised of components similar to the following:

1.	strengthening the management of family planning and  health services;
2.	increasing the financial resources of local government units; 
3.	improving service delivery and performance of service providers; 
4.	developing local support for family planning/health services; 
5.	improving national and local policies for increased financing of family planning; 
6.	improving legal and regulatory policies for health policies for service delivery; and, 
7.	developing policies for mobilizing financial resources for services. 

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the 3-year program beginning on or about May  2003.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP that will be available on or about December 17, 2002. The closing date for submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 60 days thereafter.   To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 Box 1, FPO AP 96515-1200 or Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City 1308, Philippines. You may also send your requests by e-mail to marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP. Our telephone nos. are (632) 552-9926 and (632) 552-9924. Our fax nos. are: (632) 551-9297 and (632) 552-9999. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the internet. By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (MS Word 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy. The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website. The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website. You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. As the recipient of this pre-solicitation notice, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the internet in its entirety.

Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations may be issued and will be posted on the same internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.

However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizops.gov) for amendments.

<RESPDATE>020303
<ARCHDATE>05032002
<CONTACT>Dan Gorman, Contracting Officer, 781-377-3998
<DESC>The Government intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) Block 10.2 Multi-INT Core Upgrade.  The solicitation consists of a firm requirement for DGS-X and priced options, based on funds availability, for all other actions. The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Integration Systems Program Office, ESC, Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking responsible contractors to develop, integrate, field, and test a Block  upgrade to AF DCGS (hereafter referred to as Block 10.2) to replace legacy IMagery INTelligence (IMINT) and Mission Management  AF DCGS components of the U-2 Mission Intelligence Segment (MIS) and Deployable Transit Case (DTS) systems. The tasks under the Block 10.2 program are to define, implement, integrate, field and test a new IMINT, MASINT (Measurements and Signature INTelligence), ISR Management, and Mission Management capability to be integrated with the existing AF  DCGS SIGnal INTelligence (SIGINT) capability. The Block 10.2 effort is the initial step toward the migration of AF  DCGS to a fully integrated, multiple-INTelligence (multi-INT) capability that satisfies the Air Force  DCGS Operational Requirement Document (ORD) and consists of the acquisition of a Multi-INT Core capability, a Surveillance and Warning component, and upgrade of existing and production of a new Data Relay system.  The AF DCGS Block 10.2 effort described in this Notice will be the Multi-INT Core capability to include the following integrated functions: 1)      An integrated information management structure that includes a repository layer, process layer, and viewer/application layer.  All system components will affix metadata tags to all data with time stamps, reference to information sources, information processing pedigree, geographic reference, and target reference.  This will be linked through a collaborative environment that permits the dynamic access and manipulation of information at geographically separate areas. 2)      A multiple security level environment (not Multi-Level Security on the same enclave) with security enclaves separated by Protection Level-4 (PL-4) security guards to ingest, process, store, and disseminate multi-INT, multi-source data.  The levels involved include unclassified, collateral, SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information), and allied/coalition force releasable data.  A key feature of the system will be the development of a bi-directional PL-4 certified High Speed Imagery Guard (HSIG) between the imagery processing and sensor control components at the Low level, and the NITF (National Imagery Transmission Format) storage system and Distributed Sensor Planner at the operating location System High level.  This High Speed Imagery Guard must be capable of handling three low side simultaneous feeds from Common Imagery Processor (CIP) and other sources at real time mission data rates and high-to-low feed of sensor tasking from the sensor planner back to the CIP. The system must be accreditable in accordance with Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 (DCID ). 3)      A mission management capability to distribute planning, tasking, and management services over the AF DCGS WAN and distributed relay SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) network (referred hereafter as AF DCGS Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination Architecture (DPA) and over C4I networks (e.g. JWICS and SIPRNET).  Automated interfaces are required to national and tactical external tasking sources.  A Distributed Sensor Planner that can simultaneously plan and monitor multiple ISR collectors is integrated with these functions.  This capability will include interface to remote Air Force Forward (AFFOR) sites and their supported Air Operations Centers (AOC). 4)      A situational awareness and multi-INT environment that provides access to a collection of common data processing and fusion services.  The situational awareness function will combine various near real time reporting sources into a single integrated picture. This will include integrating the information from the Surveillance and Warning (S&W) component under separate development.

<SUBJECT>A -- Kinetic Energy Interceptor Capabilities
<SOLNBR>HQ0006-03-R-0003
<CONTACT>Susan Pollack, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-695-9123, Fax 703-697-7907, Email susan.pollack@mda.osd.mil - Nancy Cunningham, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-695-6267, Fax 703-697-7907, Email nancy.cunningham@mda.osd.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) wants to acquire advanced kinetic energy interceptor capabilities as integral elements and components in the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  MDA plans to use an evolutionary, spiral approach to achieve increasingly greater and more robust capabilities over time against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight to include mid-course and terminal phases as well as boost/ascent phase.  MDA's plan is to first demonstrate a kinetic energy capability against ballistic missiles in the boost/ascent phase from a deployable ground-based launch platform; the goal is to have demonstrated this capability and have built prototypes for follow-on test and training by the end of FY 2009.  This first capability will then evolve over time to work with other launch platforms (e.g. sea-based) and to fill capability shortfalls in the overall BMDS architecture.  The contractor(s) or contractor team(s) MDA selects to demonstrate this capability must have recent, relevant experience in all of the following seven areas: (1) weapon system integration, (2) booster development, (3) kill vehicle development, (4) launcher development/integration, (5) integration with external sensors, (6) battle management, command, control and communications and (7) missile production.  Failure to have any recent, relevant experience in one or more of these areas will be disqualifying.
	
MDA will issue a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Concept Design Phase on or about January 7, 2003, and a formal RFP on or about February 4, 2003.  The Government plans to award up to three firm-fixed price contracts to U. S. prime contractors capable of design, development, and production of this class of interceptor and weapon system.  These contracts will be approximately 8 months in duration.  

The Government plans to select a single Boost/Ascent Element prime contractor team for development and test from the proposals submitted by the Concept Design contractors near the end of the concept design phase.  The development and test phase contract is expected to be a cost type contract with a period of performance from 48-60 months.  The contract will include options for interceptor capability evolution.

INTERESTED COMPANIES ARE INVITED TO AN UNCLASSIFIED KI INDUSTRY DAY AT 8:30 A.M. ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 18, 2002, at the Marriott Forum located at 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202.  Foreign firms may attend, but are precluded from proposing as a prime.  

To register, please e-mail Ms Nina Ervin at Nina.Ervin-contractor@mda.osd.mil and provide your company name, the names of planned attendees (up to four), and the name, e-mail address and phone number of your company point of contact for this event.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement to reduce operational support costs and increase the safety margin through proactive wire integrity analysis. NAVAIR has determined advanced Automatic Wire Analysis (AWA) is necessary to meet these requirements. The goal of this advanced AWA development (adaptation and improvement of commercial off the shelf technology) is to provide new or improved testing capabilities, not currently available using today?s non-destructive wiring inspections methods.  Use of AWA to identify wiring system failures and establish proactive wiring system inspections, is expected to provide substantial savings in terms of Maintenance Man-Hours (MMH), costs associated with false equipment removal, and reductions in Non-Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft availability.  This is a notice of intent to request a proposal and negotiate with ECLYPSE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, 265 N. JOY STREET SUITE 150, CORONA, CA  92879 on an other than full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ECLYPSE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a modification to Contract N00421-02-C-3075, for software adaptation and system integration of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hardware previously procured from Eclypse International to sustain EA-6B and C-2B Fleet Support Team (FST) maintenance functions. Eclypse International is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the hardware and baseline software. A primary goal of this contract action is the modification of a traditionally proprietary software environment to an open architecture open systems environment. This requires detailed knowledge of the OEM hardware development and original software coding. The proposed action will be a Firm Fixed Priced modification to Contract N00421-02-C-3075 and the estimated period of performance for this effort will be twenty-one (21) months after award.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation document is available.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

CONSULTING SERVICES TO ASSIST IN AN AUDIT ON THE SAFETY STATUS MEASUREMENT SYSTEM (SAFESTAT) IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOW BELOW:

Statement of Work for 
Outside Consultant on Audit of 
Safety Status Measurement (SafeStat) System

I.	General Information

A.	The Safety Status Measurement System (SafeStat) is an automated analysis system that uses data on crashes, roadside truck or bus inspections, and on-site compliance reviews to measure the relative safety fitness of interstate motor carriers.  The system uses extensive data that is maintained by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  This includes records on over 600,000 motor carriers, annual reports on approximately 110,000 bus and truck crashes, and results from over 10,000 compliance reviews conducted annually.

B.	Congress has requested that the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Transportation conduct a comprehensive independent investigation of SafeStat.  The Congressional request specifically asks that the OIG review the validity and objectivity of the methodology employed by SafeStat and the quality of the data used in calculating the SafeStat ratings.  Failure to have sufficient expertise to analyze the complex computer model used and the large amount of information processed by the system will make it difficult to provide a credible reply to all the Congressional concerns by March 2003, which is the time period specified in the request.  

II.	Scope of Work

The work requires expertise in statistical sampling and quantitative methods as well as familiarity with the requirements for conducting audits using computer applications.  Specifically, the contractor will be required to:

A.	Assist in the assessment and replication of an effectiveness study performed in 1998 by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.  This includes critiquing the assumptions and methods used in the earlier study and identifying an appropriate methodology to use for comparing crash rates between motor carriers identified by SafeStat and those that were not.  

B.	Recommend methods to use to examine the validity of the SafeStat model, to include, but not limited to, tests for ensuring that any interdependence among the model?s elements are accounted for to guard against double counting of the risk factors.  

C.	Provide recommendations, as required, for conducting tests of the computer applications that process the algorithms used for the SafeStat model.

D.	Assist in the development of a statistical sample of data used by SafeStat to determine the degree to which data is not complete, accurate, or timely.  This includes assisting with the identification of different strata, determining appropriate sample size, and identifying appropriate methods for selecting the sample.  An adequate sampling plan is needed given the extensive data and source material that must be analyzed to respond to the Congressional request. 

E.	Assist in the assessment of industry concerns about bias in the SafeStat system against certain geographic regions or industry sectors.  Recommend analysis using appropriate statistical tools to quantify the degree and significance of interstate differences in data reporting. 

F.	Evaluate preliminary results and conclusions formulated by the audit team and determine if there are any errors in the execution of the sample selection methodology and in the extrapolation of results to the overall population.  

G.	Recommend adjustments to the sample or to the review plan based on the audit team?s findings during the course of the review.

H.	As required, serve as expert witness before Congress or Departmental officials to provide credible support and explanation for the reviews methodology and conclusions.
I.	
Work to be performed under the contract is not to exceed 120 hours.  

III.	Deliverables

The contractor shall deliver 2 written deliverables, in hard copy or disks as required, identifying the following:

A.	Deliverable #1:  (a)  Recommended methods for replicating prior study and assessment of assumptions and methods used in prior study.  (b) Recommended methods to use in assessing the validity of the SafeStat model. (c) Evaluation of stratification plan and sample selection methodology developed by audit team for meeting the objectives of the review.  

B.	Deliverable #2:  (a) Evaluation of team results to identify errors in sample size, sample election, or in the extrapolations made to the overall population. (b) Evaluation of team results to identify additional work needed to validate the SafeStat model or more fully assess prior study results.  

Due Dates for all deliverables to be established by the audit team following contract award.

Work will require periodic meetings at Office of Inspector General offices in Washington, D.C. and may require occasional meetings in Boston, MA.  Any travel costs submitted must conform to Government regulations and will be reimbursed based on actual costs incurred.

IV.	Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be between established in the approved audit plan.  At this time it is expected to be between November 2002 and April 2003.

V. RFC -Request for Clarifications 
 
The RFC shall be e-mailed to Phaedra.johnson@tasc.dot.gov NLT November 25, 2002 by 12 noon. 


This Qoute will result in one award based on best value. If interested in this Qoute please e-mail phaedra.johnson@tasc.dot.gov for evaluation criteria.

C) An offeror proposing as a joint venture may receive a neutral rating for past performance if a history of performance as a joint venture is not provided.  Risk for performance may be elevated if an offeror lacks past performance with the proposed design agent.  Past performance will be evaluated using the information required and provided under Factor 1 - Design/Build Experience.  The government will also draw from available CCAS and ACAS database reports and will consider other information obtained from other sources.  The evaluation of past performance is a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.

<DESC>BN/RSL is interested in procuring a wide variety (up to 30 at 1 each) of covert security cameras that operate in the international video formats of PAL or SECAM.  Covert cameras are typically used for video surveillance in areas where it is not desirable for the camera to be noticed by the casual observer.  Covert security cameras are typically packaged in a configuration that is small, less than 3? (7.5 cm) on each side.  To achieve this small size, covert cameras usually use solid sate devices as the video detector of the camera unit.  Covert cameras are typically sold in a variety of configurations that include but are not limited to:
1. Camera in an enclosure.
2. Camera mounted on a small printed circuit board.
3, Camera mounted within another surveillance sensor, such as a personal infra-red (PIR) detector.
4. Camera mounted within other items, such as a framed picture, books, jewelry, clothing, and other furniture, decorative, or personal items. 

Please provide the following information on offered products:
1. Photo or drawing of the configuration
2. Video format
3. If possible, provide the Input and output requirements, for example the camera needs 6 Volts of power via a barrel connector and video is provided via a BNC connector.
4. Manufacturer
5. Price list for quantity 1
6. Delivery time after receipt of order
7. If possible, provide the manufacturer and part number of the video detector chip used in the camera.
8. If possible, provide the date the product was initially offered on the market.

Note that we are only interested in cameras that operate in PAL or SECAM as their native video formats.  For example, we are not interested in NTSC format cameras that are coupled to a separate conversion device to produce PAL or SECAM video signals.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000 is interested in acquiring information on commercially available or non- developmental item (NDI) suppressors that will reduce the baseline muzzle  flash, blast and sound signatures of the Armys XM107 Caliber .50 rifle system  (also commercially available as the Barrett M82A1-M).  The XM107 is a rapid- fire; man portable, shoulder-fired, recoil operated semi-automatic system  utilizing military standard .50 caliber ammunition.  The primary components of  the system consist of a rifle, day optical sighting system and hard carrying  case(s). It is requested, but not required, that interested companies submit  one (1) sample system as part of their information submission.  These  information samples will be used as an indication that companies have a system  readily available.  Information samples will be returned in, as tested  condition.  Potential contractors must be able to produce a minimum of 60  systems per month, with a production surge capability to 90 systems per month.   The suppressor must be able to reduce the baseline signatures of the XM107  without adversely affecting or degrading weapon performance/accuracy,  functionality, recoil, safety and reliability.  It must also be modular enough  to be quickly and easily installed and removed by the operator without  requiring the use of special tools not readily available to the operator. If your firm has an existing, commercially available or non-developmental item,  which meets the specified requirements, please provide brochures or other  information relative to the performance and physical characteristics (i.e.  size, weight, etc.) of your product.   This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice. There is no formal  solicitation available at this time.  No award will be made as a result of this  market survey.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice  will be published. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation  to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in  part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.

<DESC>The US Government is looking for sources to provide comprehensive insurance coverage for cancellation/abandonment of Air Fete 2003 (air show) which will be held at RAF Mildenhall, located in the United Kingdom. The funding structure of this event is self-regenerating in nature, meaning the proceeds from one year will go to pay for the following year?s air show.  Due to the requirement of a large portion of the budget being obligated in advance of the actual air show, insurance is required to minimize the risk to the government of loss of these funds if it becomes necessary to cancel/abandon the air show due to any condition beyond the control of the organizers.  This includes but is not limited to following: weather, disruption due to increased flight activity as a result of disaster relief work, operational issues affecting the base, terrorist threat, hostility, acts of war wherein force protection conditions limit/block public access to the base. The terrorist threat condition is broken into two types of incidents that would force the cancellation of Air Fete. The first type would be an attack abroad that is ascertained to warrant a heightened security posture (Force Protection Condition Charlie or Delta, where the base is effectively shut down). The second type would be an attack or reliable information regarding an attack directed specifically at RAF Mildenhall or the adjacent base, RAF Lakenheath immediately prior to the Air Fete. The insurance provider would be required to provide coverage for $1.5 million in obligated funds in the event of cancellation/abandonment. Please send a letter of interest along with a description of the coverage that can be provided and any possible alternatives to the 48th Contracting Squadron, Attn: Jeremy Babb, Bldg 55, Marham Road, RAF Feltwell, Thetford, Norfolk, IP26 4HL, or you can e-mail the information to jeremy.babb@lakenheath.af.mil. Request all responses be received no later than 13 Dec 02. Questions can also be directed to Jeremy Babb at  01638 52 7088 or international 011 44 1638 52 7088. Correspondence should include company name, point of contact, address with post code, telephone and fax numbers, and an email address if available. Alternate POC is Donald Wagoner at 01638 52 7076, email: donald.wagoner@lakenheath.af.mil.

The Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina is seeking potential sources to design, furnish, and install a complete automatic control system for the Plating Shop, Building 4035, as a ?turnkey? project.  The existing plating line control system is a Square D Sy/Max PLC processor and I/O system which monitors tank levels, tank temperatures, and provides direct start/stop control for exhaust fans, recirculation pumps and solenoids, and all scrubbers and make-up air units.  The existing PLC system uses 8 point I/O modules rated at 120VAC with a total of approximately 96 digital inputs and 296 digital outputs distributed in seven (7) cabinets.  Interposing relays provide high current contacts for the motor starter, scrubber pumps, recirculating scrubber pumps, exhaust fans, chiller pumps, make-up air units, and other miscellaneous pumps.  The new automatic control system shall be programmable logic controllers manufactured by Rockwell Automation/Allen-Bradley with ?hot-backup? processors to maintain control of processes if the primary PLC processor fails.  The automatic control system shall provide, as a minimum, automatic control of plating tank temperatures and levels, exhaust and scrubber fans, rectifiers, make-up air units, and auxiliary equipment.  The project will also include relocating all power and control wiring running just below the exposed grating floor of the plating shop to above the production floor.

Respondents must have on permanent staff at least: one (1) engineer registered in their state of residence experienced in Allen-Bradley industrial processing control systems and Allen-Bradley trained in automatic control systems and one (1) software engineer experienced in programming ladder logic and developing HMI interfaces.  Respondents must also have successfully designed and installed an Allen-Bradley industrial process control system similar in size and function within the last 5 years.  Respondents must also have the capability to provide field surveys of the existing power and control systems and develop accurate as-built drawings for these systems within the Plating Shop.

Respondents are asked to provide information about their technical knowledge and capabilities to provide the design and construction services being sought and completion of similar type projects.  This is for information gathering only and if further procurement action is taken, additional publications will be issued as required.
